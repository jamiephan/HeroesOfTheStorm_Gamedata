VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Your time is coming, murderer. The Scarlet Crusade rises against you!
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=My crusade is now your crusade.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroQuestion_Evil00=I have far too much integrity to ally with one so corrupt...
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroQuestion_Evil01=You? How appalling.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroQuestion_Evil02=Serve the Crusade well and I suppose I can defer your punishment.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroQuestion_Good00=Another "hero" lacking the conviction to do what is necessary.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroQuestion_Good01=Are you willing to go all the way this time?

VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroQuestion_Undead00=Your plague of undeath will not take root in this realm.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroQuestion_Yrel00=Bear witness, draenei. This is how to wield the Light against the corrupt.

VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Evil01=When this is over, I will deal with you personally.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Evil02=Keep your poisoned words to yourself.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=That's rather enticing.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Flame00=<DO NOT RECORD: reuses IntroAgree01. "They will bathe in the cleansing flame of the light".>
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Good00=Your lack of faith will not impede my ambitions.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Good01=Those who wield the light must be unyielding, lest they burn away.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Good02=The words of the impure fall upon deaf ears.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Join00=You could prove useful to the crusade. Join me.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_KelThuzad00=(patronizingly explaining)The Light will reduce you to ash. It's not complicated.

VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_MalGanis00=Your deceit falls upon deaf ears.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto00=There is no greater hatred and scorn than that which exists in my heart.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=<shudder> Stop talking. That noise is unbearable.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=I converse with neither the dirt beneath my feet, nor you.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_No00=I do not answer to you.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Paladin00=Yet not all are worthy of its gifts.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=We shall be the Light that vanquishes the darkness.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Stitches00=The feeling is mutual.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Your suffering has yet to begin.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Tired00=<sigh> Your ignorance is exhaustive.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Tyrande00=Convenience is desired only by the slothful.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Undead00=My desire for victory supersedes my desire to destroy you. For now.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/IntroResponse_Yrel00=<laugh> The Light is more vengeful than you draenei will admit.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Kill00=The Light has spoken!
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Kill01=Death to all tainted by the Scourge.

VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Your little "killing spree" ceases now.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/KillStitches00=Disgusting wretch.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/KillSylvanas00=Even the Dark Lady cannot abide the Light.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/KillUndead00=Let this be a lesson: the Scarlet Crusade will not be taken so easily!
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/KillYrel00=You squander the Light's blessings.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/KillZealot00=You think YOU'RE a zealot? <mocking laugh>

VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Ping_KillHero00=This infidel must die for their sins!
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed00=Greetings.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed01=What do you seek?
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed02=I've found that without proper guidance crusades quickly become onslaughts.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed03=I know we're supposed to call everyone Heroes these days, but Renault will always remain my champion.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed04=Oh, you noticed the new chapeau! <beat> ...it's not on my loot table, so don't try anything!
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed05=I'm not bad. I'm just rendered that way.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed06=Join the Scarlet Crusade. Meet interesting and stimulating people... purify them.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed07=The priest in me likes when you confess your sins, but the Inquisitor in me likes to punish you!
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed08=Why does everyone who comes to the Scarlet Monastery want to kill me? Am I out of touch? No, it is the heathens who are wrong.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed09=We Whitemanes have never approved of the Greymanes' rule. They're too neutral. With Blackmanes you know where they stand! But with Greymanes, who knows? It sickens me.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed10=I always ensure my champions keep on fighting 'til the end.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed11=Well, Renault always got "arise" out of that one. <smug laugh>
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed12=My Scarlet Diviners examined every Scarlet letter of every Scarlet Book in Scarlet Monastery's Scarlet Library... yet none was a Scarlet Thesaurus. So I burnt it down.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed13=Me? A horseman of the Ebon Blade? <scoff> I would never serve the undead! Besides, do I look like I'd be caught dead in black?
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Pissed14=No one expects the Scarlet Inquisition!
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Resurrected00=I have arisen? An interesting reversal.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Resurrected01=Thank you, there is still much to be done.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Revive00=I am the Light's retribution.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Revive01=The Scarlet Crusade endures.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Revive02=Someone will suffer for that insult.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Revive03=Truth cannot be erased.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Spec00=Glory and zeal.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Spec01=I deserve this.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Spec02=The devout shall be rewarded.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Spec03=Soon we shall have our vengeance.

VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/UI_Vox_Spun00=<dizzy after being spun around. woozy.>
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/UI_Vox_Spun01=<dizzy after being spun around. woozy.>
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Do you seek absolution, acolyte? Prove to me your worth.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/UI_WaitLocked01=I await a true champion; devout and more importantly, faithful.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Why are you making me wait, champion? The impure yearn for salvation...
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=This is growing dull, champion. (light)Entertain me. (aggressive)NOW.
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Ultimate1Used00=We are unbreakable!
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Ultimate1Used01=The Light shall protect you, champions!
VoiceOver/WhitemaneBase/Ultimate1Used02=May the Scarlet Aegis gird you!
