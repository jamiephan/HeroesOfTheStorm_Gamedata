VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_AngelicMortal00=Adorning oneself with the armaments of heaven does not make one angelic.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Anubarak00=Nerubians. Insects like you deserve to be exterminated.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Auriel00=Auriel. I trust you are ready for the battle ahead.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Must I really fight alongside a vile wretch like you?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Chromie00=Those who meddle with fate find themselves succumbing to theirs.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Nephalem. Am I to believe that this "Nexus" considers you a "hero"?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Deckard00=The last of Tyrael's Horadrim. Why he puts such faith in mortals is beyond me.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Your very presence is an affront to the High Heavens.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=My old enemy. Can you survive long enough for me to kill you?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Draenei00=I sense a divinity in you not found in most mortal races. You may prove to be a trustworthy ally.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Dreadlord00=The blasphemy you call "the Fel" will be abolished from existence. And I shall start with you.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Evil such as yours exists only to be vanquished.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Your very presence befouls the air around us. Keep your distance.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Evil02=First, I shall slay our enemies. So you have at least that long to live.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Genji00=An ally who has been defeated before we even begin does not inspire confidence.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Good00=Must I yet again cooperate with mortal heroes?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Good01=Do you have the valor necessary to purge this realm of evil?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Good02=I am watching you, "hero." Try not to disappoint me.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Guldan00=The one who calls himself darkness incarnate. How I look forward discarnating you.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Law00=You seem more dependable than these other mortals. Show me the extent of your valor.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Leoric. The ease with which you fell to corruption is proof that your kind must be annihilated.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Lucio00=Is that cacophony supposed to be music? How infantile.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=How, Malthael? How could you betray everything we stand for? Answer me!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Mephisto00=Your hatred is nothing before the Heavenly Host, Mephisto.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Mephisto_Demonic00=You dare to judge me, Mephisto? YOU? I will obliterate you! Do you hear me?!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=What in Pandemonium are you?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=You? This battle will be far more irritating than anticipated.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Negative01=More allies unworthy of Heaven's light. <sigh> Very well.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Negative02=Be thankful the ancient law of the Nexus forbids me from putting you down right now.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Negative_Demonic00=<Reuses introquestion_negative00>
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Nephalem00=Must I fight beside your wretched kind, nephalem? I voted for your destruction!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Paladin00=What makes you think you are worthy to wield such light? Step aside.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Come, noble warrior. We shall burn the wicked to ash.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Terran00=So humans infect other universes as well? How astoundingly disappointing.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Tyrael! Ancient law strictly forbids us from interfering with the mortal world. Yet you have done so, brazenly!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Undead00=Undead. The rabid dogs of demons and necromancers.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroQuestion_Whitemane00=Interesting. I seldom meet mortals with zeal such as yours.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroRespond00=I am the Aspect of Valor. And that was a foolish question.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroRespond01=War is my reason for existence.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroRespond02=Did you really just ask me that? ME?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroRespond_Demonic00=I am the Lord of Wrath. And that was a stupid question.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=What you sense is far beyond your pitiful imagination.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Alarak_Demonic00=Is that a joke, you pompous snake? I am wrath incarnate!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Alexstrasza00=And you are unlikely to do so again.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_AngelicMortal00=You are unworthy of the armor you wear. When this is over, I shall tear it from you myself.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=What did you just say?!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Anubarak00=You have no idea.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Arrogant00=I am more than capable of dealing with this threat alone.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Auriel00=I always keep a level head!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=I'm not the one who was slain by a lowly nephalem, Azmodan.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Bored00=Is blustering all you are capable of?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=So you do feel fear.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Chromie00=Be silent. Not all of us have the luxury of time.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=That's enough of your nonsense.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=I fight alongside no one. I lead, and others follow.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Your prayers have gone unheeded.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Speak to me again, and Solarion will answer.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=I will bear witness to your annihilation, demon.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_DiabloPrime00=I fear nothing!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=You are not worthy to speak to an angel.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Draenei00=Your piety is admirable. Unlike those wretched humans.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Dreadlord00=I am not convinced that you have the strength required to find out.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Evil00=Vermin like you deserve to be exterminated.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Evil01=Do not speak to me again, you vile wretch.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Evil02=I will deal with you soon enough.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=This will be a glorious battle!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Good00=Just stay out of my way.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Good01=Hmph. We will see how far that confidence takes you.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Good02=<Begrudging grumble>
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Guldan00=We will settle our differences later. ...and there is a vast difference between us.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Laugh00=<Amused chuckle>
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Law00=Your mortal laws are far too soft. There can be no imprisonment!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=To you? No.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Lucio00=Indeed. You are unworthy of the honor, mortal.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=Brother... If only you had not attacked the High Heavens...
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto00=Then you shall be the first to suffer it.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto_Demonic00=My wrath will blacken your bones and scatter your ashes into the wind!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Monk00=A presumptuous notion.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=May those who have wronged you burn in the flames of your wrath.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Know this: Even if we win the battle, I will not thank you for it.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Negative01=Victory will be mine. You may witness my glory before you die.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Negative02=Such petulance. If I cared even the slightest I would discipline it out of you.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Negative_Demonic00=<Reuses Introresponse_negative01>
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Nephalem00=Tyrael is too lenient with Sanctuary. I will not make the same mistake.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_No00=No.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Paladin00=Do not presume to think yourself an agent of divinity. You are a child playing with fire.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=For once I fight beside a worthy ally.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Silence00=Be silent before l ensure your silence.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Solarian00=Solarian will speak for me.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=I am merely here to correct your many mistakes, Tyrael.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Undead00=I should immolate you where you stand, you rotting corpse.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Warrior00=The greatest warrior in creation stands by your side. Fear nothing.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Your crusade is nowhere near as grand as the armies of the High Heavens.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Kill00=Mercy is a sign of weakness.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Kill01=A feeble distraction.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Kill02=Pathetic.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Kill03=So easy, Tyrael could do it.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Kill04=Evil defeats itself.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillAuriel00=Auriel... I had no choice...
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillButcher00=Back to the Burning Hells with you!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillD2Hero00=Your kind are an abomination!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillD3Demon00=Demonic filth!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillDeckard00=Tyrael's vaunted Horardrim. Pathetic.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillDiablo00=I will never tire of doing that.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillIllidan00=You call yourself a demon hunter? Pathetic.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillImperius00=Imposter!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillLesser00=Your masters will be next!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillMalthael00=If only the nephalem could have done this for me...
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillMephisto00=You should have honored the pact, Mephisto.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillNephalem00=I've wanted to do that for a long, long time.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillSpreeEnd00=You call that a killing spree?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillTyrael00=You chose the wrong side, brother.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/KillWoWDemon00=What a poor excuse for a demon.

VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/LowLifeHeal01=The Heavenly Host could use someone like you.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/LowLifeHeal02=I will remember your deeds.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/LowMana00=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/LowMana01=I have no mana, you fool!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/LowMana02=My mana is low.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/MatchEnd00=As if there were any doubt.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/MatchEnd01=With valor, all things become possible.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/MatchEnd02=My glory is a matter of fate.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/MatchEnd_Demonic00=Through wrath, one can accomplish anything.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/No01=Are you always this inane?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/No02=I will do no such thing.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Ping_AssistHero00=We must make up for our ally's weakness.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Ping_AssistHero01=An ally is in need of assistance.

VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Ping_KillHero00=Slay that hero!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed00=What is it?
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed01=Speak, mortal.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed02=Stop that!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed03=You are making me angry! I'm fired up, and I'm tired of the way that things have been!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed04=If you ask me, discretion is the worst part of valor.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed05=I am the only angel in the Heavenly Host with blazing wings of valor. Pay no attention to the mortals who pre-ordered Reaper of Souls.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed06=For eons, I have wanted to post guards at the Diamond Gates. I hate it when someone comes knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed07=The Silver City stands as a testament to order and harmony. It is truly a City of Angels. <beat> Uhh, the traffic is a nightmare, though.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed08=All dogs go to heaven. Except for zombie dogs. <beat> Blame the nephalem. I do.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed09=You dare suggest that I lack compassion? Ha. I am valor on the outside, and velour on the inside.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed10=Demons beware. This archangel is packing heat.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed11=All mortals should be exterminated. Change my mind.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed12=Listen closely. I am not "wrath." I am wroth. Wrath is a noun; wroth is an adjective. Know the difference.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed13=If you wish to turn water into wine, seek out the Archangel of Fermentation. But be warned: He stinks to High Heaven.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed14=Why have a hood when you can wear a helmet? It's far more metal.
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Pissed15=Enough. Can't you tell I'm running out of steam?<SFX: steam whistle>

VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Resurrected01=Valor cannot be vanquished so easily!
VoiceOver/ImperiusBase/Resurrected_Demonic00=Wrath cannot be quelled so easily!
