VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroQuestion00=Ready to blow things up?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroQuestion01=You ready?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=Oh man, the Alliance. Fine, but I'm charging double.

VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroRespond01=Let's do this!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroRespond02=Count on it, boss!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Yeah, yeah... typical alliance stuff. Hey, I'm gonna go blow things up, okay?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroResponse_Angry00=Yeah. Mhm. I'm not mad. Nope. (clearly bottling things up inside)Not bottling things up inside...
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroResponse_Arthas00=I'm a goblin engineer, pal. I've got unlimited power covered, okay?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroResponse_CrusaderOrc00=That's the coolest thing anyone's ever said to me.

VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroResponse_Thrall00=(confiding)You were always my favorite warchief. Just saying.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroResponse_WarTwo00=Yeah, sorry, second war was a long time ago. So you know... (trailing off)I, uh...
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=You are the worst kind of human. You know that?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/IntroResponse_Yrel00=THIS is why no one likes the Alliance. Can we just fight these guys?

VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally's in trouble!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Ping_AssistMe00=Help!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Ping_AssistMe01=I don't want to die... unintentionally!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Ping_AttackCastle00=Let's wreck their core!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Ping_AttackMerc00=I say we get some mercs.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Demolish this fort!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Ping_AttackTower00=Anyone want a watch tower?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Ping_DefendCastle00=Protect the core!

VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Ping_KillHero00=Enemy hero! Let's get 'em!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed00=What?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed01=Who is it?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed02=I've got what you need. As long as what you need, is a LOT of explosives.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed03=Finally got my goblin engineering card last week, my mom was so proud. <confused exertion> What? What do you mean it's useless? <frustrated scream>
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed04=That's it! I'm filing a complaint with Roxxik at the guild about this. <beat> It's dynamite... the complaint is dynamite. That should be obvious.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed05=Back in the day, I had these two friends. We were inseparable. Whatever happened to those guys? Ohhh, right. <Makes explosion sounds with his mouth>
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed06=Sapper? I hardly know her! ...Yeah, yeah. I'll see myself out.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed07=Everyone's always concerned with the blast radius. I care more about the blast circumference.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed08=One rat's junk is another rat's robotic exo-skeleton. My mom taught me that. (sentimental)I love you, mom!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed09=You hear about the goblin movie? It was a REAL box-office bomb. I mean that literally, the box office was a bomb. All that burnt popcorn. Sheesh.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed10=Goblin Law of Engineering number twenty-seven: Never build a bomb that you can't run away from.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed11=Goblin Law of Engineering number twenty-seven point five: If you CAN'T run away, give it to someone you hate.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed12=Have you seen those treasure goblins running around? THAT is an offensive stereotype. Goblins are not just obsessed with money, okay? We're also obsessed with explosives.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed13=By the way, goblin sappers don't deal "random damage". We deal consistent damage, randomly.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Pissed14=You ever been fishing with a goblin? <SFX: Light's a fuse. Throws something into the water. It explodes> Yeah, me neither.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/R2Revive00=A miracle of goblin engineering!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/R2Revive01=Rocket, ho!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/R2Revive02=Strapped in!

VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Resurrected01=Good looking out.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Revive00=I'm back? Well, that's new!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Revive01=Who or what to explode next?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Revive02=<cough> Got the black lung now.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Revive03=Did the jumper cables work? No? Okay.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/RipTireKill00=Kablooey!

VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Spec03=Packs a punch.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Spec04=Yeah, baby!

VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Taunt01=Bock-bock! Bock-bock-bock-bock!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Taunt02=C'mere! I just wanna give you a hug!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/TeamKilled00=What happened?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/TotalMayhemKill00=You stepped in something!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/TotalMayhemKill01=Always watch for explosives around a goblin.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/TrapDeploy00=Heehee. Here we go!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/TrapDeploy01=And what's the catch of the day?
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/TrapDeploy02=I am so clever.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/TrapDeploy03=Please don't break this time.
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/TrapTriggered00=Trap sprung!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/TrapTriggered01=It was a trap!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/TrapTriggered02=Bitey, ain't it?

VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/UI_WaitPurchased00=Hurry up! I'm holding live explosives!
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/UI_WaitPurchased01=Uh, 'scuse me. Gonna work on those last few skill ups... <SFX: WoW crafting sounds and ding>
VoiceOver/JunkratGoblin/Ultimate1Used00=This'll be a blast!
