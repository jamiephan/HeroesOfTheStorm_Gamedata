VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/AI_MercCapture00=I'm going to "open negotiations" with these mercenaries.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/AI_OnMyWay00=Looks like you could use a rogue.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/AI_OnMyWay01=Are you picking a fight without me? Not on my watch.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/AI_Retreat00=Hearthstone break!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/AI_Retreat01=Keep at it. I'll be back in a minute.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/AI_Uhoh00=Kael's teeth! What is wrong with you?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/AI_Uhoh01=Who said you could die?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/AI_Uhoh02=No!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Attack00=My blades are ready.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Attack01=Now you're thinking like a rogue.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Attack02=Time for you to die!

VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Healed_Evo01=Nice...
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Homescreen00=Shhh. <subtle laugh, pleased with herself as she steps into the shadows.>
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroAgree00=Huh... Sounds fun. I'm in.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroAgree01=Time to show our foes how dangerous I really am.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroAgree02=Good thing I sharpened these daggers.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroBoast00=Do you sense that? Our enemies are afraid.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroBoast01=Huh, not a bad team. Let's go tear our enemies apart.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion00=You are ready for this battle, right?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion01=<clearing throat> Are you ready yet?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Arthas... I will never forgive you for what you did to Quel'Thalas.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Interesting. The demonic energy coming from you is unlike any I've sensed before.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Kaelthas00=Kael'thas. The traitor who would be king.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Kelthuzad00=Watch. Your. Back.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Ugh, murlocs are the worst.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Huh. Well, I suppose four out five will have to do.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Hmph, alright. You'll do.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Rehgar00=Rehgar Earthfury... It has been a long time since we fought side by side.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Rexxar00=Have you ever aimed for somewhere other than the face? Just curious.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Scourge00=The Scourge is my eternal enemy. Nothing will change that.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Stealth00=Dual stealth, huh? They'll never see us coming.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Lady Sylvanas! I am humbled to fight by your side.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Thrall? You're warchief again? What happened to Sylvanas?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Valla00=Love the hood.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Varian... Figures I'd find you here... Can't stay out of trouble, can you?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroRespond00=Heh. Of course.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroRespond01=Just point out the ones you want dead.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroRespond02=Fighting is what I do.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Be silent. I've had enough of your kind for a lifetime.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_DismissMage00=I'll match my wits against your magic any day.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_DismissWarrior00=<scoff> You warriors are just rogues in plate armor.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Kaelthas00=You would sell us out to the demons. I will hear no more from you.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Uh oh... You didn't just.. "make inky." Did you?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Don't be too surprised when you find a knife in your back.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=My alliances are personal.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_NightElf00=At least our men don't take thousand year naps while the women do all the work.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ha, this'll be quick and easy.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Rehgar00=Wow, Rehgar.... You got old.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Scourge00=Shut your mouth, you walking corpse.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Stealth00=Death from the shadows.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Anu belore dela'na.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Horde... Alliance. What has either done for me? No, I fight for myself.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Valla00=Can't wait.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Watching you kill everything is not a strategy.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Kill00=<scoff> I was taught by Rehgar Earthfury.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Kill01=I told you to watch your back...
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Kill02=You're done for.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Kill03=Don't make it so easy.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Kill04=They always underestimate me.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/KillChogall00=Remember these blades, Cho'gall? They remember you.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/KillDreadLord00=Try not to get your nether in a twist about it.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/KillKaelthas00=Death to all who betray the Sin'dorei.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/KillRehgar00=You're getting awfully slow, Rehgar.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/KillScourge00=Resurrect quickly. I can't wait to kill you again.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Kiss your killing spree goodbye!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/KillUnkillable00=This time you die for real!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/KillVarian00=Come on, Varian. I know you can fight better than that.

VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/LowMana00=I don't have enough energy.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/LowMana01=Not enough energy.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/LowMana02=I can't do that yet.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/LowMana_Evo00=Mana low.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/MatchEnd00=Perfect execution.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/MatchEnd01=Thank you.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/MatchEnd02=I like the way you think!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/No00=I can't do that.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/No01=Not happening.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/No02=Stop that.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally's in trouble.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I need a little help here.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Someone assist me.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Attack00=I think we should attack here.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Let's go for the core!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Anyone else think we could use some mercs?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=We should attack this fort.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_AttackTower00=I think it's time we took this watch tower.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Capture00=We should claim the objective.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Capture01=Secure the objective, quickly.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Collect00=We should gather these.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Collect01=Let's collect these.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Danger00=Danger lurks here. Trust me.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Danger01=Look out. That area's dangerous.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Defend00=We should defend here.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend the core!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=We need to defend our fort.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DefendStructure00=Defend that structure!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DefendStructure01=Keep the enemy off the objective!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DefendThing00=Defend our ally!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DefendThing01=Our ally needs support.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Don't let the enemy near our watch tower.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Level that structure!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=The enemy's defending that structure. Destroy it.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=Someone kill that thing!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=I say we kill the big guy.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Enemy's missing. Keep an eye out.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_EnemyMissing01=The enemy just disappeared. They're up to something.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_KillHero00=Eliminate that hero.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=I'm on my way.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=Be there in a moment.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Retreat00=Retreat!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Retreat01=Get out of there.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Transport00=We need to move that.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_Transport01=Shouldn't we be moving this?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Head to the turn in point.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Hand over whatever you've collected.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed00=Huh? What?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed01=If you have something to say, try saying it.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed02=Horde... Alliance... What has either faction done for me? My allegiances are my own.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed03=After the scourge destroyed our homeland everything changed. Even the way we craft our armor. You could say it made us a little spiky.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed04=Ugh, Thistle tea tastes awful. I wouldn't serve this to a donkey!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed05=I'm not a child... It's just that we elves age like the finest of wines. You humans age like cheese. Cottage cheese.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed06=Stealth is my middle name. Valeera Stealth Sanguinar. Thank the sun, I didn't become a merchant or something.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed07=I'm an excellent rogue, but I can't perform miracles... Not after that nerf, at least.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed08=Don't worry, I'm both rouge and a rogue. So no matter how poorly you spell, you're still covered.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed09=You know, I bet the Garden of Terror is a great place to find new ingredients for poisons. Someone remind me later.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed10=Whatever you can do in five combo points. I can do in three.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed11=It's not a cheap shot, it's completely balanced. Maybe you just need to learn to fight!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed12=Specializations are more like suggestions. Personally, I think of myself as a Subtle Outlaw Assassin.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed13=Yes, some rogues are beautiful, but ALL rogues are stunning.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed14=Swords? No, actually these are orc daggers. Everything they have is oversized. I mean, have you seen their shoulderpads?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed_Evo00=What?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Pissed_Evo01=Say something.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Resurrected00=I'm alive? Thank you!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Resurrected01=All this and no res sickness? <laugh>
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Revive00=Oof. Ribs are still sore.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Revive01=Back in action.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Revive02=Someone's getting a blade to the neck for that.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Revive03=Alright... Shake it off, Valeera.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Social_Goodbye00=Shorel'aran.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Social_Goodbye01=Farewell.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Social_Hello00=The pleasure is mine.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Social_Hello01=Greetings.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Social_Sorry00=Mistakes were made.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Social_Sorry01=Sorry about that.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Social_Thanks00=Thank you.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Social_Thanks01=My eternal gratitude.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Social_WellPlayed00=Well played.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Okay, that was a... little impressive.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Spec00=Like the way you think.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Spec01=Yeah, that'll cause some damage.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Spec02=Fine with me.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Spec03=<chuckle> Should be fun.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Spec04=Stronger already.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Taunt00=Watch your back.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Taunt01=I will be your death!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Taunt02=I'll see you in the shadows.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Taunt_Evo00=Watch... your... back.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Taunt_Evo01=Death.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Taunt_Evo02=I see you.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/TeamKilled00=Well then.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_ExLocked00=Why hello.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Well met, my friend.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_Gift00=Given away again?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_Lockin00=Here we go.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_Purchase00=You won't regret it.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_Trial00=Let's do this.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_Trial01=Looking forward to it.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Can we do something? Anything?
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Don't wait too long. Bored rogues tend to get stabby.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ugh. I suppose I could work on my lockpicking.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hmm. Maybe there's time for a round of hearthstone.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ultimate1Used00=I'm gone.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ultimate1Used01=Here's smoke in your eye.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ultimate1Used02=Into the shadows.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ultimate1Used03=Hope you like blinding powder.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Gone...
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ultimate2Used00=<laugh>
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ultimate2Used01=Shadows envelop me.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ultimate2Used02=Cloak of shadow!
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ultimate2Used03=I don't think so.
VoiceOver/ValeeraBase/Ultimate2Used_Evo00=Shadow.
