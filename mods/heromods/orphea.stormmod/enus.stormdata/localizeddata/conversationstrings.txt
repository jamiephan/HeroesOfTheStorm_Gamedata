Character/Name/Orphea=Orphea
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Attack00=Quick! Exploit their weakness.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Attack01=This is our moment to strike!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Attack02=Let's make this a little more exciting.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Caution00=Something bad's about to happen...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_GoodJob00=I could get used to this!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_GoodJob01=Now that was amusing!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_GoodJob02=Are you trying to show me up?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Heal00=This realm has healing fountains. Use them!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Heal01=You need a healing fountain. Maybe the whole thing.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Retreat00=Let's get out of here.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Retreat01=Time to practice running away.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Uhoh00=That was... unexpected.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Uhoh01=Oh good. Just what I wanted to happen.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/AI_Uhoh02=Unfortunate...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Attack00=You're a bother!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Attack01=Hah!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Attack02=Why do you have to be part of the problem?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Attack03=I'm annoyed now.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Attack04=Just go away and don't come back.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Attack05=Too easy!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Attack06=I cast a long shadow...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Celebrate00=Something finally went right?!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Celebrate01=We're on our way to winning!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Comeback00=Someone might have overplayed their hand... We can do this!

VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Healed00=Ah, much better.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Healed01=Refreshing!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Healed02=Thanks for the relief, healer.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroAgree00=Obviously. Have you seen what I can do?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroAgree01=It's easier than having any kind of conversation with my family.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroAgree02=Right. I know this game.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroBoast00=I grew up watching heroes and learning from them. We'll win.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroBoast01=I'm the daughter of a realm lord, and you're a seasoned champion. No one can stop us!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion00=Are you ready to fight back?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion01=So you're prepared to help this realm?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Aggressive00=You... don't have many friends, do you?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Deckard00=It's good to see you again, old man.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_DragonShire00=You did the right thing in Alterac Pass.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Ugh. I was trying to get away from brutes like you...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Evil01=You think you're pretty impressive, but you're not.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Evil02=Do you really just stare at things and growl all the time?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Good00=Ah, so you're trying to make things better around here too?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Good01=You seem to really like helping people. A lot.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Good02=Are you going to aid the weak or give me a lecture?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Luxoria00=Oh great. You're from Luxoria...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Mephisto00=If you stay away from me, I'll stay away from you.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Mistharbor00=You pirates are all the same.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Why are you doing this to yourself?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=I should be getting rid of people like you.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_NewerHero00=I don't recognize you from any of the battles I've seen. Are you new here?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_OlderHero00=Ah, you're one of the heroes who's been fighting here for years, aren't you?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=I don't know why, but you seem nice... for a hero.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_RavenCourt00=Ah, one of my father's minions...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroQuestion_Undead00=You look scary! Do I know you?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroRespond00=You know I am.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroRespond01=There's no avoiding it now!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroRespond02=Yes. I chose to fight, even if it risks everything.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Are you really going to speak to me that way?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Arrogant00=You're just relying on me to do everything, aren't you?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=Nothing in my father's library explains that!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Thanks. I've thought a lot about what you said, and you're right.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Hmph. You're boring, anyway.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_DragonShire00=This reminds me of my stay in Dragon Shire. It ended badly.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Evil00=You can wield dark power without being a monster, you know.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Evil01=I'll never be like you. That much is certain.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Evil02=I do as I please. Get used to it.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=This is gonna be too much fun. Someone should probably stop us!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Gibberish00=Do I pretend to understand or just ignore this?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Good00=You might be a little too into this righteousness thing.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Good01=These lands need more champions like you.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Good02=You're so serious about this! Lighten up a little.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Luxoria00=...And this is why I don't want to live in Luxoria. You're all crazy.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto00=I have other ideas.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Mistharbor00=If I were you, I'd be sailing the high seas about now.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Stop it. You're embarrassing both of us.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=You couldn't be worse if you tried.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_NewerHero00=You still have a lot to learn about these realms.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_No00=No chance of that!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_OlderHero00=I can tell you've been fighting here for a long time, champion.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=You're almost as good at causing trouble as I am.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_RavenCourt00=One day you'll serve me. Just keep that in mind.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Tired00=<yawn> What did you say? Nothing important, right?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/IntroResponse_Undead00=You'd fit right in at Raven Court.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Kill00=The Nexus just got a little safer...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Kill01=They never know what I'm capable of.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Kill02=Aren't enemies supposed to be scary?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Kill03=I won't miss your face.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Kill04=Today's my day.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Kill05=I guess I am my father's daughter...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/KillAlliance00=Are there any fights you haven't lost?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/KillCain00=Oh! Sorry about that, Cain.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/KillDragonShire00=Very consistent in your failures, aren't you?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/KillHorde00=This is for Alterac Pass.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/KillMephisto00=Your evil dies with you.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/KillRavenCourt00=You always were my father's pawn.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Every good killing spree must end.

VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Laugh12=<big laugh>
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/LowLifeHeal00=I guess I have to thank you now.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/LowLifeHeal01=That was perfectly timed, friend.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/LowLifeHeal02=You can stay by my side. For now.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/LowMana00=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/LowMana01=Out of mana.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/LowMana02=I need more mana.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/MatchEnd00=I've fought alongside worse people.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/MatchEnd01=I'll be seeing you in the Nexus... right?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/MatchEnd02=I'm counting on your support in the future.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/No01=Not going to happen.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/No02=What part of "no" do you not understand?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Aw, someone needs us.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I can't do this on my own... sadly.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Want to help me before it's too late?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Their core is vulnerable! Let's go!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Help me recruit these mercs.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Bring the siege to this fort!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Seize this watch tower.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=We can't lose our core!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=We need to hold onto this fort.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Keep our enemies away from this tower.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ping_KillHero00=Slay this enemy, and our chances will improve.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed00=I will never stop fighting.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed01=These realms must know peace again.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed02=The Dark Nexus is a nightmare that should be sealed away forever.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed03=Maybe I can't change everything, but at least I've already changed something.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed04=You really don't want to know what's in the box.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed05=My magic can take any form I choose, but I try to keep it fun.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed06=You probably have some questions about the realms...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed07=...but if I answered all of them, you'd just be bored!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed08=Honestly, I'd rather be at home reading than out here fighting. I like books about histories and legends the most.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed09=My father made a lot of mistakes, but I wasn't one of them. Well, maybe from his point of view...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed10=I'd never been to Dragon Shire until I ran away from home. It's so green there... I think I'm allergic to it.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed11=If you're wondering if I can turn into a giant raven, then you should know it's none of your business.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed12=Neeve always told me not to make a fool of myself... unless it makes someone else a bigger one.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed13=I come from a very old family in a very old realm... with very old problems. I wanted to leave them behind, but they always follow me.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed14=The best thing about this place is the same as the worst thing--it's always changing. And you'll never know who you'll next meet--or fight--or kill.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Pissed15=But the Raven Lord shall walk his tower... nevermore.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Resurrected00=Oh, I'm back? Good.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Resurrected01=Ah, so someone is paying attention to me...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Revive00=This isn't over.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Revive01=I don't want to do that again...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Revive02=Ugh. My head hurts.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Revive03=I won't give up that easily.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Spec00=I never wanted this power... but I'll accept it.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Spec01=I can play around with that.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Spec02=Why not?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Spec03=That's impressive.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Spec04=It's just what I imagined.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Taunt00=<beckoning exertion>
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Taunt01=<beckoning exertion>
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Taunt02=Hah!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/TeamKilled00=Well, I'm used to being outnumbered...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_ExLocked00=I can make a difference here, if you let me.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah, so you trust me now?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_Gift00=Fine. I'll try to make friends.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_Lockin00=For the Nexus!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_Purchase00=A clever choice.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_Trial00=This isn't the first time I've had to prove myself.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_Trial01=You really want to see what I can do? Hmph.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_Vox_Spun00=<dizzy after being spun around>
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_Vox_Spun01=<dizzy after being spun around>
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_WaitLocked00=I wonder what's going on out there...
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Do you want to defeat our enemies or not?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=By all means, take your time. I'm not in a hurry or anything.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Are you getting me a snack or something over there?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ultimate1Used00=My wrath takes form!
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ultimate1Used01=The power of my ancestors flows through me.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ultimate1Used02=Taste defeat.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ultimate2Used00=Know your place.
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ultimate2Used01=Going somewhere?
VoiceOver/OrpheaBase/Ultimate2Used02=Stay together now.
