VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion01=Are your preparations complete?
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_AmazonNova00=Ah, sister Nova... I look forward to seeing your archery skills in action once more.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Auriel00=So there are female angels. Hm. Perhaps there is hope for the High Heavens yet.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=So this is a Butcher... I am not impressed.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Ah, a paladin! No... a crusader. Any chance you've found us a way to Sanctuary on your quest?
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=You're the new blood, I see. Let's see if you can impress a daughter of Skovos.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Stay out of my way, demon, and you may live through this.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Diablo... I see your exile wasn't as permanent as expected.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Dismissive00=You? <sigh> What a waste.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=A frog demon. How did you escape the jungles of Kehjistan?
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Xul! It's been too long. <beat> Did you get paler?
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=You... We haven't even begun and already I'm disappointed.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Ah, well met, warrior.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Tyrael... Good. Perhaps now justice can be met.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroQuestion_Wizard00=Ah, you are Ysendra's pupil. I expect quite a lot from you.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroRespond00=The Askari are ready.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroRespond01=Don't trust me yet? You will.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroRespond02=Let my actions be your answer.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_AmazonNova00=An informal way to address your War Matron. We will have to work on that.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=I have impaled fools who offended me less than that.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Auriel00=Where there is will, hope follows.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Indeed. A war with YOU.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Come now, I've known Barbarians with fiercer war cries.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=And what do you imagine I spent that time doing? Sleeping?
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=You nephalem are awfully chatty.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Do know how many of your kind have been impaled on my javelin?
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Keep talking, and not even death will save you from me.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Silence. I ill need distractions right now.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Mockery... the favored tool of the impotent.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Was that a question? Do not expect an answer, frog creature!
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Mm. Always the charmer.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Who permitted you to speak?
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=The fury of Skovos is at your side.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Tyrael! We meet again!
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Undead00=Congratulations, you are the surliest undead I have met.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/IntroResponse_Wizard00=Loss and death is not "fun" young one. I'm surprised Ysendra didn't teach you this.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Kill00=Rest in peace.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Kill01=Good riddance.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Kill02=You have been bested. <laugh>
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Kill03=Never duel an Amazon.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Kill04=Success.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/KillAmazon00=Forgive me, sister. I had no choice.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/KillAngel00=Underestimate mortals at your peril, angel.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/KillAzmodan00=I've spent twenty years dreaming of that.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/KillD3Hero00=This is a nephalem? Hmph.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/KillDemon00=Burn in Hell, demon.

VoiceOver/AmazonBase/LowLifeHeal00=Much appreciated.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/LowLifeHeal01=I owe you my life.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/LowLifeHeal02=Well timed.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/LowMana00=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/LowMana01=More mana.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/LowMana02=I need more mana.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/MatchEnd00=It has been an honor.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/MatchEnd01=Naturally.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/MatchEnd02=This is what we've trained for.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/No00=I can't.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/No01=That won't happen.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/No02=Impossible.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Do not abandon our ally.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I need help!
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Help me!
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Take down their core!
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=I think we could use some mercenaries on our side.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=We must eliminate their fort.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_AttackTower00=We should capture that watch tower.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend our core!
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Protect our fort.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Keep the enemy away from that watch tower.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ping_KillHero00=Take down that hero.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed00=Yes?
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed01=You have the War Matron's attention. Let your words count.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed02=When the oracles foresaw the Dark Exile, our warriors trained for millennia.Their vision was proven right when I defeated the Prime Evils.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed03=But their predictions did not end there. The demonic hordes would come again, and the Askari would need an army.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed04=Tell me where you need a javelin, and I'll deliver it, lightning fast. That's the Amazon promise.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed05=Have you ever wondered why so many people hide keys under rocks? And gold for that matter...
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed06=Hold on, I need to manage my inventory. <SFX: Diablo 2 movement sounds. A bunch of them in a row.> <exertions> Um... (nervously)Haha... This is going to take awhile .<SFX: One or two more..> <more exertions>
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed07=Try not to be blinded by the light. Unless you want to get lost in the dunes in the middle of the night.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed08=If you find yourself in trouble, keep moving forward. Your lightning shield will absorb half of your enemy's attacks, at least...
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed09=Never refer to a Valkyrie's assistance as the Ride of the Valkyries. They do not find it humorous.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed10=The jungles of the Amazon homeland teem with life. Our warriors discovered a new species just the other day. Unfortunately, it was a giant spider-lizard... so it simply HAD to die...
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed11=Wait, do I no longer have a stamina bar? Alright, some of these changes are pretty good.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed12=Lightning never strikes twice. Javelins, however, do. 
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed13=There is a saying on the Isles that "a grey head is a crown of glory." Most likely an old person started it.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Pissed14=Life is an ethereal armor. One moment it's here, and just when you get used to it.... it's gone.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Resurrected00=It seems it is not my time.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Resurrected01=(realizing)You've brought me back... Thank you.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Revive00=Hmph. Thought I had joined the Valkyries for a moment.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Revive01=Death deters no daughter of Skovos.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Revive02=I am ready once more.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Spec00=Ooh! A new skill? I'd forgotten that feeling.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Spec01=Yes, a clever tactic.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Spec02=Mm, that's familiar.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Spec03=Excellent.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Spec04=I am blessed by the Heavens.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Taunt00=Step forth, and be judged.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Taunt01=Initiate hostilities! I dare you!
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Taunt02=Come and lend me you ear. Permanently.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/TeamKilled00=Do not lose heart.

VoiceOver/AmazonBase/UI_Lockin00=The wait is over.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/UI_Purchase00=Your fight is mine.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/UI_Trial00=Preparation is the better part of valiance.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/UI_Trial01=Let us begin your training.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Let me aid you.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/UI_WaitLocked01=I have been waiting for twenty years. Surely it is time to fight.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Wish there was somewhere to rest my weapon.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Last time I stood around like this we had a campfire.
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ultimate1Used00=Heaven's fury!
VoiceOver/AmazonBase/Ultimate1Used01=Zerae's vengeance upon you!
