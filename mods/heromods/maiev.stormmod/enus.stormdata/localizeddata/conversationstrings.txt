VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Guldan00=The foul menace you serve will never conquer Azeroth, warlock!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Horde00=The Horde. Must I ally with such filth?
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Illidan00=Illidan! I will hunt you down for as long as I live!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_IllidanNew00=Did you really think you could elude me, Illidan? Run again, and I'll shackle you like the beast you are!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Kaelthas00=Allying with Illidan. I always knew you couldn't be trusted, Kael'thas.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=I see you too thirst for vengeance. We will claim it together.

VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=Malfurion. I thought I smelled the stench of cowardice.

VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Murky01=Where's Murkidan?
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=You...
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=So we're to be allies, are we? Good.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Tychus00=Your armor is your prison? Is that what passes for justice among your people? Pathetic.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Are you prepared to deliver justice to this realm?
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrande00=The traitor Tyrande. You belong in a cell, no less than Illidan.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroQuestion_Valla00=A demon hunter, are you? Hmm. Your brand of demon hunting, I can accept.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroRespond00=My watch is eternal. I am always ready.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroRespond01=You would be a fool to think otherwise.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroRespond02=The question is, are you?
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Ana00=Never. A warden's watch is eternal.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Say that again, and I'll make sure you never speak another word!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Go on. I would love an excuse to slay you.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_DemonHunter00=I would do anything to save Azeroth. Even if it means releasing you.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Druid00=Good to see you're awake for this fight.

VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=When this is over, I will see your kind purged from Ashenvale.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Illidan00=Can you put aside your arrogance, Betrayer?
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Illidan01=I don't know, can you put on a shirt? It's distracting.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_IllidanNew00=Forgive me if my glaive finds your heart, Illidan. It's hard to distinguish you from the rest of this filth.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Impressed00=You appear to be a resourceful ally. Let's see what you can do.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Insulting00=Forgive me if my glaive finds your heart. It's hard to distinguish you from the rest of this filth.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Kaelthas00=Yes, me. The one who saved your wretched life back in Lordaeron.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=I never have fun. But I will enjoy tearing our enemies to shreds.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Mage00=The arcane is responsible only for ruin. Misuse it, and I will show you no mercy.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=A true shan'do would forge their own fate.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=<Seething>Ugh. Murlocs.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Speak to me again, and I'll throw you into a cell.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Today, justice will be done.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Tychus00=Watch your tone, convict. Or I'll throw you back into prison myself.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=The archangel of justice. It is an honor to fight beside you.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Tyrande00=Like she tested mine while you murdered my sisters?
VoiceOver/MaievBase/IntroResponse_Valla00=Vengeance will be ours.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Kill00=You never stood a chance.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Kill01=I did say dead or alive.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Kill02=Justice is mine!

VoiceOver/MaievBase/KillIllidan00=My long hunt is finally over.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/KillIllidan01=I feel nothing. I am... nothing.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/KillIllidan02=Hmm. I thought that would be more satisfying.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/KillKaelthas00=You should have kept your mouth shut.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/KillMage00=The only good mage is a dead mage.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/KillMalfurion00=That was for the good of the kaldorei.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/KillNaga00=You are an affront to everything the night elves stand for!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Your hunt is over, wretch.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/KillTyrande00=This time, you really are dead.

VoiceOver/MaievBase/LowMana01=Not enough mana.

VoiceOver/MaievBase/MatchEnd01=A warden's work is never done.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/MatchEnd02=Do not flatter me.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/No01=Impossible.

VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Stand with our ally!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Where the hell are our reinforcements?
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Are you coming, or must I do this myself?

VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Relinquish your holdings at once!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Hand those over. Now!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed00=What is it?
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed01=Do you need something?
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed02=I used to think justice was blind. <Gritting her teeth>And then I met Illidan.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed03=I am vengeance. I am the night. I am a warden!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed04=Nothing escapes my sight. Not even when I blink.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed05=My umbra crescent is a formidable weapon, but my skills are what make me dangerous. A warden's true power comes from beyond the glaive.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed06=I will never forgive Cordana for betraying us. But after dealing with Khadgar, I can see why she lost her sanity.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed07=Like us wardens, owls are vigilant watchers and silent hunters. They're also quite good at delivering letters. Much better than ravens, anyway.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed08=I am nothing like Illidan! I merely do whatever is necessary to achieve my goals, even if it means making morally questionable decisions while growling about the hatred I've felt for ten thousand years!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed09=Betraying the kaldorei? That's an imprisoning. Consorting with demons? That's an imprisoning. Consuming the Skull of Gul'dan and becoming a demon? Oh, you better believe that's an imprisoning.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed10=I have no idea where my brother Jarod went during his long exile. Am I my brother's keeper? No! <pause>I'm Illidan's keeper!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed11=Why yes, I do know the secret behind the owl statues on the Isle of the Watchers. All wardens do. We just won't share it with you.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed12=A pristine Core Hound Tooth, a custom forged Perdition's Blade, and of course, a sharpened Shard of Azzinoth. My dagger collection is quite extensive. That's because I'm a fan of knives.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed13=So I murdered a few Highborne, tried to kill Malfurion, and fled Darnassus as a wanted fugitive. Can't you just drop it and move on? Everyone else has!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed14=What do you mean I'm obsessed with Illidan? It's not like I think about him every day. And every night. Picturing his smug grin as I sharpen my glaive, imagining how it would feel when I plunge into his chest, right between those big, disgusting tattoos, leaning in close to watch the light fade from his eyes-- Oh, I'm sorry. What were you saying?
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Pissed15=You're still talking to me!? At least give me a cough drop, you monster!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Resurrected00=The hunt is far from over.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Resurrected01=I owe you for that.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Revive00=They will know my vengeance.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Revive01=This isn't over!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Revive02=I will not rest until justice has been met!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Social_Goodbye00=Farewell.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Social_Goodbye01=Until next time.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Social_Hello00=Hail, hero.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Social_Hello01=I greet you.

VoiceOver/MaievBase/Spec00=Smart.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Spec01=A wise choice.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Spec02=My skills are sharper than any blade.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Spec03=This could prove useful.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Spec04=Another weapon in my arsenal.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Taunt00=I've got my eye on you.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Taunt01=You can't hide from me.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Taunt02=Don't even think about it.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/TeamKilled00=No! They will not escape justice!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_ExLocked00=I am vengeance itself.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_ExPurchased00=When the time comes, I will be on your side.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_Gift00=I will go where I am needed.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_Lockin00=None shall flee my grasp!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_Purchase00=I am forever bound to the hunt!

VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_VOX_Spun01=<Spun around until dizzy; falls>
VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_VOX_Spun02=<Spun around until dizzy; falls>
VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_WaitLocked00=We must hurry. I have no time for idle nonsense.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_WaitLocked01=We're wasting time here.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Enough of this. The hunt awaits!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Illidan is out there somewhere.
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ultimate1Used00=I am the iron hand of justice!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ultimate1Used01=This will be your prison!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ultimate1Used02=Ashal thoridas!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ultimate2Used00=Abandon hope!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ultimate2Used01=I will have my vengeance!
VoiceOver/MaievBase/Ultimate2Used02=Tor ilisar'thera'nal!
