VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Allying with such evil is not a test I was expecting.

VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroRespond02=(with a smile)Hm. Just watch.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Glory to the Alliance!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Are you trying to anger me? How childish.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Just words. Pointless ones at that.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Evil00=Your foul words do not sway me.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Greymane00=<small laugh> Lead on, my friend.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=We share an enemy. Try not to forget it.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=As always, I appreciate your guidance, Lady Jaina.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Oh sure, that's cute now. But I know what happens when you grow up.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=I do not require you to speak. Only to fight.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Noble00=I will choose to overlook that.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Come, friend, we have a battle to win.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Rehgar00=Life of luxury? Are you talking about me?
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Only my enemies shall know my rage and I intend to keep that promise.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/IntroResponse_Tyrande00=(with a smile)Likewise, High Priestess.

VoiceOver/VarianBase/LowMana_Evo00=Need mana.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/MatchEnd00=For the Alliance!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/MatchEnd01=You humble me.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/MatchEnd02=It has been my honor.

VoiceOver/VarianBase/No01=That would be a mistake.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/No02=I will not.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally is in need of assistance.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I need some help.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Lend me your aid!

VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Demolish their fortifications.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Lay claim to this watch tower.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_Capture00=Capture the objective, now!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_Capture01=Seize the objective.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_Collect00=We should gather these.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_Collect01=Collect as many of these as possible.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_Danger00=That area grows perilous.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_Danger01=Look out. That area is unsafe.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_Defend00=Rally our defenses here.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Protect our core!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=We must defend our fort!

VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=This building is our target. Leave it in ruins.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=Eliminate the enemy's support.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=Take down the big one... the rest will scatter.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=The enemy has gone missing. Prepare yourselves.

VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Make for the turn in point.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed00=Your king listens.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed01=The line of Stormwind's kings is restored.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed02=This belt was once belonged to Anduin Lothar, the Lion of Azeroth. His spirit still guides us to this day.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed03=The Nexus has gathered powerful heroes from many worlds... but for what purpose? What if this is just the calm before the storm?
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed04=You know, I still watch three v. three arena fights from time to time. Warrior, rogue, and druid teams are my favorite, but I'll admit, I'm a little biased.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed05=All the great warrior abilities, none of the stance restrictions. Anvilmar would be jealous.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed06=Fury, Arms, and Protection. Each has its use on the battlefield, the key is choosing the right one, at the right time.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed07=People wonder how I learned how to quell my rage... But the secret is, I'm always angry.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed08=It seems like I've seen Onyxia's head hang from the gates of Stormwind a million times... Still not enough.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed09=Someday I hope to see Stormwind's park restored. It was always a... calming place for me.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed10=Oh, I just thought of the perfect joke to tell Anduin! What do you call a gnoll that won't share his forest? A hogger! <laugh> Oh, he's going to love it!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed11=Hmm. I'm not sure about these talents... How do I respec? Ugh, why is there never a class trainer around when you need one?
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed12=Is anyone else hungry? Like a wolf? No? Well, what about Greymane? He HAS to be!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed13=Anduin got me to play Hearthstone once... it was a bit "fantastic" for my tastes. What kind of game allows Garrosh to order ME around? It's absurd!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed14=Never take advice from someone named Prestor, ever. They're always a dragon... Trust me.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed15=Are you still clicking? Was that not enough jokes? Were you not entertained!?! Sorry, uh... sometimes my gladiator past gets the best of me.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed_Evo00=King... listens.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Pissed_Evo01=Stormwind... restored.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Resurrected00=I will remember this kindness, healer.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Resurrected01=Thank you. Let us return to the fight.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Revive00=This battle is far from over!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Revive01=For the glory of the Alliance!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Revive02=I am not dissuaded so easily.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_Dance00=Well, I am a king after all.

VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_Goodbye00=Serve with honor.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_Goodbye01=Farewell.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_Hello00=Stormwind is reborn.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_Hello01=Well met.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_Sorry00=I am sorry.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_Sorry01=My apologies.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_Thanks00=Thank you.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_Thanks01=You have my thanks.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_WellPlayed00=Hah. Impressive.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Well fought!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Spec00=Ha, stronger already.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Spec01=I'll make use of it.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Spec02=Most excellent.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Spec03=Let our enemies beware.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Spec04=Hmm, a useful talent.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Taunt00=Come, and see why they called me Lo'gosh.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Taunt01=You stand between Stormwind's king and his goal. Unwise.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Taunt02=I've never lost a fight in the arena and I'm not starting now.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Taunt_Evo00=Come forth.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Taunt_Evo01=Unwise.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Taunt_Evo02=Never lose.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/TeamKilled00=The fury you're feeling, right now... Unleash it on our foes!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/UI_ExLocked00=Stormwind honors those who serve.

VoiceOver/VarianBase/UI_Lockin00=We will forge a great destiny!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/UI_Purchase00=Glory to the Alliance!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/UI_Trial00=It's been a while.

VoiceOver/VarianBase/UI_Vox_Spun11=<Dizzy exertion. After being spun around, Varian is now woozy like the room is spinning.>
VoiceOver/VarianBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Perhaps we should spar? I hear positive things about the trial mode.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/UI_WaitLocked01=We have waited long enough. Let us act.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Our enemies grow stronger by the minute. Let us bring the fight to them.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Perhaps you should focus on leading, rather than reading.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ultimate1Used00=Face me!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ultimate1Used01=You're holding back... don't.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ultimate1Used02=Let's see how you fight!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ultimate1Used03=No potions!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Face me.
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ultimate2Used00=Fall before the might of the king!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ultimate2Used01=You will break!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ultimate2Used02=Make your peace!
VoiceOver/VarianBase/Ultimate2Used03=Your defenses are nothing!
