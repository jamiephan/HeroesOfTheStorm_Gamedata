VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Lady Jaina. Your magical prowess will surely be a boon to us.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroQuestion_Lunara00=Cenarius's daughter. I see you still serve life... in your own way.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=A murloc child? Does your mother know where you are?
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=You? Impossible.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Ah! Well met, friend!
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Ah, shaman. I am always glad to fight beside one with such respect for life.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroQuestion_Undead00=You shamble around like a gruesome puppet. Your very presence is an affront to life.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroRespond00=Do you know not the Dragon Queen?
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroRespond01=(correcting)I am ready, to preserve life.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroRespond02=Cast-off your doubts. They provide us little benefit.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=<Do not record. Reuses IntroRespond00>

VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Chromie00=The honor is mine, timekeeper.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_DVaDestroyer00=And I thought Wrathion had an attitude problem.

VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=No good shall come of this discourse, it seems.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=This will be wondrous.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Guldan00=Those who trade life for power are unworthy of such a blessing.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Hanzo00=Let us find out.

VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Life00=Life is worth fighting for.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Lunara00=Join me and defend all life, Lunara. Beyond just that which you approve of.

VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Together we shall bring hope and life to this realm.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Probius00=Interesting. You are a machine, yet I sense a spark of life dancing within you.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Royal00=Hmm. Very well, I concur.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Well met, indeed, shaman.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/IntroResponse_Undead00=With a single breath, I can free you from your cursed existence.

VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Kill01=Life is worth fighting for.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Kill02=A loss for all.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Kill03=Some cannot be saved.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Kill04=Death is not my goal.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/KillArthas00=I mourn the loss of all life. Even one such as you.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/KillChogall00=Another victim of the old god's madness.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/KillChromie00=A good duel, sister. Nozdormu would be proud.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/KillDemon00=Your kind are unwelcome in my domain.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/KillDragon00=I never wanted this.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/KillGuldan00=Feel the suffering you inflicted upon my children!
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/KillMalthael00=Appointing yourself Angel of Death does not make it truth.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/KillScourge00=Your blight ends here.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Your rampage has reached its conclusion.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/KillUndead00=An appalling mockery of life.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Laugh01=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Laugh02=<big, hearty laugh>
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Laugh03=<aggressive laugh. Ha!>
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/LowLifeHeal00=My life was nearly extinguished.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/LowLifeHeal01=You have quite the gift, my friend.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/LowLifeHeal02=I owe you a great debt.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/LowMana00=I am without mana.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/LowMana01=I lack the mana required.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/LowMana02=No, I have not enough mana.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/MatchEnd00=I am humbled.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/MatchEnd01=You honor me.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/MatchEnd02=Victory belongs to all of us.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/No00=Impossible.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/No01=No, I cannot.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/No02=That shall not occur.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally is in dire need.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I could use assistance.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_AssistMe01=To my aid, heroes.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=We should assail their core!
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=We should recruit these mercenaries to our side.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Destroy this fort.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Capture that watch tower.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Protect our core!
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Keep the enemy away from that fort.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Keep that watch tower in our hands.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ping_KillHero00=Take that hero down.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed00=Yes, champion?
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed01=It is the fires within, that burn the brightest.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed02=Surely you were not brought into this world solely to bother me.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed03=You address the Dragonqueen.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed04=Life... goes on. It goes on and on, and on, and on.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed05=I know we've been instructing you not to for years, but trust me. This one time, stand in the fire.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed06=My brood has told me I can be a real queen sometimes. But it's a mother's right to be at least a little... draconian.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed07=I'll let you in on a secret. Ruby dragons don't actually use hearthstones. We just click our talons together a few times and we're home.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed08=You have no idea how hard it is to find jewelry that magically changes size.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed09=Of course Chromie arrived in the Nexus before me. Bronze dragons have to be first at everything. And last... And everything in-between.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed10=Sylvanas may have worn it first, but you have to admit I wore it better.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed11=Don't push me too far. I can be one bad mother when I choose to be.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed12=Wait, what do you mean I'm not allowed to do the "Life, uh finds a way" joke? I'm a dragon! <scoff> Thanks, Dehaka.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed13=(explaining)It's a wing buffet. It's only a "wing buffet" to my enemies.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed14=Life is good, life is beautiful, life is even strange. What it certainly is not, however, is a highway.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Pissed15=Before battle, I always assure my forces that through the fire and the flames we'll carry on.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Resurrected00=Ahh, new life blooms.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Resurrected01=Your assistance is well timed, friend.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Revive00=Life springs anew.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Revive01=Fear not, I have returned.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Revive02=I am not quelled so easily.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Revive03=Life goes on.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Spec00=Ah, of course.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Spec01=What strange new power.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Spec02=Life has blessed me.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Spec03=Magnificent.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Spec04=An intriguing decision.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Taunt00=Life is precious. You are not.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Taunt01=I do not desire to hurt you, but I will if I must.

VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/UI_Lockin00=I shall do what I must.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/UI_Purchase00=Our lives are bound together.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/UI_Trial00=A new challenge begins.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/UI_Trial01=Witness the power of the red dragonflight.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Do not delay, mortal. Life requires a stalwart defense.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/UI_WaitLocked01=I look forward to our alliance.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=You do realize I have no quest to give you, yes?
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=It is unwise to waste the time of an Aspect, mortal.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ultimate1Used00=Our lives are bound together.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ultimate1Used01=Share in life!
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ultimate1Used02=Let life be as one!
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ultimate1UsedAlly00=<reuses ultimate1used>
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ultimate1UsedAlly01=<reuses ultimate1used>
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ultimate1UsedAlly02=<reuses ultimate1used>

VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ultimate2Used01=From flame new life springs forth.
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ultimate2Used02=Behold, the power gifted by the titans!
VoiceOver/AlexstraszaBase/Ultimate2Used03=The Aspect of Life rises against you!
