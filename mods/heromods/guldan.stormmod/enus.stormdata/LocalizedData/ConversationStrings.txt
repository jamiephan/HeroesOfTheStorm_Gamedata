Character/Description/Guldan=Gul'dan was once the most powerful of all the orcs. A master warlock obsessed with power, that sold his people into demonic slavery in a personal bid for power.

VoiceOver/GuldanBase/AI_Retreat01=My talents would be of better use... elsewhere.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/AI_Uhoh00=What do you think you're doing?

VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Attack03=It will all be over... eventually.

VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Healed02=Continue to serve me... disciple.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroAgree00=My plans are coming to fruition.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroAgree01=Their souls will feed my power!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroAgree02=A bargain forged in flame and shadow.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroBoast00=An eternity of darkness awaits those who challenge me.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroBoast01=We shall deliver these fools a sermon on suffering.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion00=The tides of war encroach. Are you ready to meet them?
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion01=Prepare yourself. Our enemy's suffering shall soon commence.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Angel00=Darkness incarnate allied with a being of light. How... whimsical.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Chogall00=It is time, Cho'gall. Join your master in battle!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_D3Demon00=Now, what manner of demon are you?
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=The Legion is here? My plans will have to accelerate.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Hearthstone00=<Reuses Taunt00>
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Horde00=You served me once... Do so again.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Illidan00=The thief who calls himself lord. Do you desire my power? Or do you only take from the dead?
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Medivh00=Ah, the so called "Guardian"... <laugh> How fitting that we are allied once again.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Murlocs... foul creatures.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=You...
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_NewHorde00=So this is what became of my Horde? <scoff> I should crush you like a gnat.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=This realm will tremble with our coming.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=The son of Durotan... I pray you are not as disappointing as your father.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroRespond00=I am darkness incarnate! Question me at your peril.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroRespond01=<scoff> This battle is meaningless. The power of the Nexus is all that matters.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroRespond02=Do not concern yourself. My fate is beyond your feeble grasp.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=<laugh> Your posturing does not impress me, being of light.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Speak to me like that again and I will crush your very soul.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Auriel00=Hope when corrupted is a potent source of power. And it seems you... (dark) are filled with it.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Chogall00=Should I now? You must tell me all about this later.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_D3Demon00=A being whose darkness mirrors my own. Fascinating.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=As the master wishes.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=<laughter> Such delusion.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=Most excellent.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=I have the power to bring us victory. What would you give to have it?
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Illidan00=Do you greet everyone with such contempt? Or just those whose power you've stolen?
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Knowledge00=Knowledge is power. And you... know nothing.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Medivh00=Indeed. This time, I shall bring it FULLY to ruin.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Mocking00=You dare mock me? We will see who laughs last.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=There is much hatred in you... but you could be so much more. Drink, Murky. Embrace your destiny.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=It seems, once more the burden of victory falls upon me.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_NewHorde00=The Horde was a weapon. A tool. Nothing more. Your idealism taxes me.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_No00=Never.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=<dark laugh> This should prove exhilarating.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Rexxar00=Do not presume to speak to me, half-breed.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Silence00=Squelch your gibbering, fool.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Save your threats, boy. You do not have the tongue for them.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_Tired00=You may cease your yammering at any time. Now, for example.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/IntroResponse_You00=Good to see I have not been forgotten.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Kill00=Your soul will serve me well.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Kill01=Whatever is left of your power... is mine.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Kill02=That was a mistake.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Kill03=Oh, your suffering has only begun.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Kill04=Crushed... body and spirit.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillArthas00=Look at what you have become... Twisted beyond recognition.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillAuriel00=Our enemy is hopeless!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillChogall00=Ever the student. Never the master.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillD3Demon00=Demonic energy. Familiar, yet different.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillDemon00=Your fel energies will serve me well, demon.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillHuman00=Yet another pale dog brought to heel.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillHuman01=If only these worthless humans could fight as well as they die!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillNewHorde00=Pitiful. The Horde could have been so much more.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillOldHorde00=You know better than to trifle with me.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillPaladin00=A paladin... <laugh> Your corpse could be of use.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Your spree has met its end.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/KillVarian00=<Laugh>
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Laugh00=<dark chuckle>
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Laugh01=<dark chuckle>

VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Laugh08=<aggressive laugh after killing enemy>
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Laugh09=<aggressive laugh after killing enemy>
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/LowLifeHeal00=Capably done, healer.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/LowLifeHeal01=Too close that time!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/LowLifeHeal02=You are proving surprisingly useful.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/LowMana00=No, I need mana.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/LowMana01=I believe a life tap is in order.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/LowMana02=Life tap, and be quick about it!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/LowMana03=I must life tap first.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/No00=That cannot be done.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/No01=I do not suffer fools.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/No02=(authoritative)No.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_AssistHero00=This weakling needs our help.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Assist me!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_AssistMe01=If I die, you will be to blame.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Eliminate their core!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Enslave these mercenary fools.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Level that fort!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_AttackTower00=This tower would serve better in our hands!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend our core!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Protect our fortifications!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Do not let them take our watch tower.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ping_KillHero00=Kill this wretched hero!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed00=You address the darkness itself.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed01=Watch your words, whelp.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed02=The Nexus is a conflux of power...  but what purpose does it serve? And more importantly how can it be made to serve me?
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed03=Does anyone know when these spikes grew out of my back? You would think I would remember something like that.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed04=I'll have you know, Death Knights were MY idea first. And for the record, most of Ner'zhul's aren't even dead. It's complete lunacy.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed05=Do not test me, mortal. I've got more power in my skull than you do in your entire body. <chuckle> Just ask Illidan.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed06=A true warlock doesn't need to summon infernal horrors, when they are the infernal horror.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed07=Poke not the darkness, lest the darkness poke you.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed08=You're saying there's an alternate timeline version of me loose upon the cosmos? <laughter> You are all so VERY doomed. They don't even know what to do with just ONE of me.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed09=I once was the head of a secretive council that controlled the orcish horde from the shadows. I called it: (dramatic)the Shadow Council... <beat> Shut up, naming things is hard!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed10=When the Warlock clans first began their training, their primitive incantations could barely summon spiders. Summoning a demon <scoff> was merely a dream.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed11=And back then, demon had an "a" in it, like I intended. It looks more mystical that way.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed12=Those with power must wield it without fear. And if that power allows you to cast fear upon OTHERS, well that's a nice bonus.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed13=I am darkness incarnate! Soon, you shall all-- <SFX: Phone Rings> Always the worst timing... I am so sorry, hold on. Who is this? <beat> ...Darkness, who? Oh? Uh, huh. Mm? <inhale> ...okay. <SFX: Click> I'm being sued for trademark infringement. Now that's evil.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed14=The Hand of Gul'dan is a monument of fire and fury. A symbol of the Horde's eternal allegiance to the Fel. ...And it is also the name of a spell. <beat> What did I say about naming things?
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Pissed15=Don't let others fool you. It is much easier being green. In fact, why don't we talk about it... <SFX: Demonic Blood bubbles menacingly> over a drink... <evil laugh>
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Resurrected00=You have made the right decision, healer.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Resurrected01=I am whole once more. Now, for vengeance.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Revive00=You are not rid of me yet...
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Revive01=This wretched realm will be brought to its knees.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Revive02=Life, death. A cycle unbroken.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Revive03=The darkness incarnates once more.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Spec00=Hm. Agreed.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Spec01=Soon it will all be mine.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Spec02=Their suffering will be legendary.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Spec03=Power in exchange for death... interesting.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Spec04=The nether obeys...
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Taunt00=Your soul shall be mine!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Taunt01=I am your nightmare!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Taunt02=I will bring you to your knees.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/TeamKilled00=Our enemy thinks us conquered. Reveal their error.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_ExLocked00=And what are you looking at?
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_ExPurchased00=You... I remember you.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_Gift00=Your friend and I shall be... inseparable. <chuckle>
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_Lockin00=I will not be denied.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_Purchase00=Now we will let loose the tides of darkness.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_Trial00=A demonstration? Very well... I have much to show you.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_Trial01=Yes, set your trials before me. They will each fall in turn.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_VOX_Spun00=<Dizzy Exertion>
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_VOX_Spun01=<Dizzy Exertion>
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_VOX_Spun02=<Dizzy Exertion>
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Fulfill your destiny and worlds will fall before us.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Just imagine the terror we could unleash together.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Hmm. What exactly are you up to?
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=You have questions, about life, your place within the cosmic order. What would you give for the answers?..
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ultimate1Used00=Bear witness to the dark master's power!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ultimate1Used01=The shattering is upon you!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ultimate1Used02=Your time is at its end!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ultimate1Used03=Beautiful...
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ultimate2Used00=Know the true essence of fear!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ultimate2Used01=Spineless cowards...
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ultimate2Used02=Run, weakling, run!
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Ultimate2Used03=Your mind... so feeble...

VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Yes03=Disorder gives way to the fel.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Yes04=Fitting.

VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Yes06=Infinite possibilities.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Yes07=Yes...
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Yes08=The ritual begins.
VoiceOver/GuldanBase/Yes09=Mine is the only way.
