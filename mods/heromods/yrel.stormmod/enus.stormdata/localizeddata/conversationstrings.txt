VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroBoast00=The Light will lead us to victory!

VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion00=Are you ready to protect the innocent?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion01=Have you prepared for the fight ahead?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Alarak00=I don't know what your people see in you. Our leaders are both wise and compassionate.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=My people owe the Alliance a great debt. Today, I repay it.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Angel00=A being of Light! With you on our side, we will surely win!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Chromie00=<DO NOT RECORD. REUSES AN INTRO LINE>
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=So now I must place my trust in a demon? I should smite you where you stand.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Fenix00=Your soul lives on inside this construct? Just like my people's vigilants! I hope you can fight like them.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Garrosh. I see you finally found the courage to fight your own battles.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Guldan00=I'm so glad to see you, Gul'dan. I thought I'd missed my chance to kill you after you scurried through the portal like a cowardly rat.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Are you willing to put aside your differences with the Alliance, and partner with a draenei?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Johanna00=Well met, Crusader. Let us bring the Light to our foes!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=My people were lost for a time, as well. But we made a home for ourselves, and I know you will too.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=A murloc! Are you truly as terrifying as everyone from Azeroth seems to believe?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=You? What could I have possibly done to deserve this?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Negative01=So, we're on the same side this time? How unfortunate.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Orc00=Despite what your kind has done to mine, I will fight beside you. Are you ready?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Greetings, friend! Let us stand together!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Positive01=Well met! It is an honor to fight beside you.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Space00=I don't think my people ever encountered yours when we were aboard the Genedar. This should be interesting.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=We fight together again, son of Durotan. Are you ready for battle?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Uther Lightbringer! Together, we will will stand in the Light!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Without the Alliance, the draenei would have been slaughtered by the Iron Horde. I can never thank you enough.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroQuestion_Whitemane00=You! How dare you call upon the light for such twisted atrocities!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroRespond00=Do not fear, for I will stand!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroRespond01=The Light never falters.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroRespond02=No matter what we face, I will not yield.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=I serve only the Light.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Alliance00=For the Alliance!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=You may not be a Naaru, but your blessings are no less welcome.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=I would appreciate it if you never spoke to me again.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Do not speak to me, demon. We'll settle this when the battle is over.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Fear00=<DO NOT RECORD. REUSES DEFAULT RESPONSE>
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Fenix00=Tribe? Only the Broken belong to tribes! Also, what is a protoss?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Yes, me. One of many who will see you brought to justice.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Gibberish00=I'm sorry, could you repeat that?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Guldan00=My people will never be broken, Gul'dan. Not by you or by the demons you serve.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=Your people did their part in fighting the Iron Horde. I will do my part in return.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Humble00=Whatever we can accomplish, it will be with the help of the Light.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Johanna00=Devotion to the Light is not a competition. But then again, what's a little fun between friends?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=What a lively bunch! Come, let's show them what we can do.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=I hate to think what would happen if the Legion ever corrupted your kind.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=<To herself>Light, give me patience...
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Negative01=Trust me, I like this no more than you do.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Negative02=Oh, so that's where that awful stench is coming from.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Orc00=Our people were once enemies, but now we are allies. Together, we will triumph.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=How lucky I am to have such brave allies.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Positive01=Fortune smiles upon us. Together, we will prevail!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Positive02=The Light is with us, my friend!

VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Righteous00=In the name of the Prophet! In the name of the Light!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Space00=Oh, another race that travels the Great Dark Beyond! You... didn't crash here, did you?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Thrall! It is good to fight beside you again.

VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=What? I've never even been to Azeroth!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=After all that you've done for my people, I am glad to fight beside you, King Varian.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=I do not know why the light answers you... but I hope it can redeem you.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Kill00=Be at peace.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Kill01=May the Light redeem you.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Kill02=You were no match for the Light.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Kill03=Faith has seen me through.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Kill04=Your strength has failed you.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/KillAlliance00=If only we had remained allies.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/KillAngel00=Killing a being of light... what have I done?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/KillDemon00=Such is the fate of all demons!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/KillHorde00=It was you or the Alliance. I made my choice.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/KillOrc00=You should never have forsaken peace.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/KillPaladin00=We could have stood together in the Light...
VoiceOver/YrelBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Your cruel killing spree is over!

VoiceOver/YrelBase/LowLifeHeal01=I nearly walked into the Light.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/LowLifeHeal02=You have saved me, healer.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/LowMana00=I need more mana.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/LowMana01=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/LowMana02=My mana is low.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/MatchEnd00=In the Light, we triumph.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/MatchEnd01=This victory is ours.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/MatchEnd02=It took all of us, together.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/No00=I refuse.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/No01=That cannot be done.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/No02=You ask the impossible.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally is in need of aid.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I need your help.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_AssistMe01=I cannot hold much longer. Assist me!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Go for the core!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=We should invite these mercenaries to join us.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Their fort is vulnerable! We can take it!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Take control of that watch tower.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend our core!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Protect our fort.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Keep hold of this watch tower.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ping_KillHero00=That hero must be stopped!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed00=How can I help?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed01=Have you any news?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed02=You have other matters to attend to, yes?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed03=It's actually quite easy to crash into a planet, you know. My people have done it before. At least twice!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed04=I am one with the Light, and the Light is with me.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed05=You want to know what my dark secret is? I see dead people. <Beat>Kidding! About that being my secret, that is. We draenei see dead people all the time.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed06=<Sigh>I really wish my people's jewelcrafting bonus worked on gems and shards.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed07=I'm not upset that I wasn't invited to join the Paladin Class Order. Or that everyone jetted off to Argus without me. Noooo, I'm not upset about that at all. Hmph. 
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed08=It's not like after all of our efforts on Draenor, the Legion just invaded anyway. Or that I was left behind while everyone joined the Army of Light to fight against my people's greatest enemy without me. Can you imagine if that happened? I'd be furious!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed09=Learning how to wield holy power effectively can be tricky. It requires a... Light touch. Ah? Ah!?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed10=Have you ever been to Farahlon? It's so beautiful! I pity anyone who has never been able to travel there. What a cruel fate it would be to hear about its wonders without ever having the chance to see it with your own eyes. Oh well, anyway, I'll send you a S.E.L.F.I.E. next time I'm there.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed11=I hate it when people make fun of my hooves, or my tail, or my horns. It really gets my goat.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed12=Sometimes, I lay awake at night and wonder... what did the orcs call Draenor before the draenei named it? Hmm. Makes you think.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed13=Am I dedicated to the protection of my allies? Or do I bring retribution to our enemies? Honestly, I'm not that into labels.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed14=Look, I appreciate that the Alliance helped us fight the Iron Horde. I really do. But housing prices in Shadowmoon Valley are skyrocketing, and that garrison is sitting on prime real estate!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Pissed15=Oh great, now I'm running late. If I want to rejoin the fight, I'll really have to hoof it.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Resurrected00=The Light shines upon you, healer!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Resurrected01=It will take more than that to stop the draenei!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Revive00=By the Light, I have returned.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Revive01=The prophet's faith was not misplaced.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Revive02=I must never rest.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Spec00=My faith is rewarded.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Spec01=I will make the exarchs proud.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Spec02=A wise decision.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Spec03=There is still much to learn.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Spec04=Well chosen.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Taunt00=This ends here!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Taunt01=I will hold the line!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Taunt02=Challenge me, if you dare.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/TeamKilled00=When all seems lost, we must hold onto our faith.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/UI_ExLocked00=Open your heart to the Light.

VoiceOver/YrelBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Are you struggling with doubt? Place your faith in the Light.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/UI_WaitLocked01=I would much rather live out the holy principles than read about them in a book, don't you agree?
VoiceOver/YrelBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=There is a time for prayer, and a time for action.
VoiceOver/YrelBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Even the patience of a draenei has its limits...
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ultimate1Used00=You cannot break me!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ultimate1Used01=I will never bow to you!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ultimate1Used02=The burden is mine to bear!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ultimate2Used00=The Light protects me!
VoiceOver/YrelBase/Ultimate2Used01=Faith is my shield!
