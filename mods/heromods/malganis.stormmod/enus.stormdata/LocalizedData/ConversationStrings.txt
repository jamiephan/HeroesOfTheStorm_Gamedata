VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Healed02=I will remember this.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroAgree00=Do not let your confidence become our downfall.

VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion00=Tell me, do you really think you are prepared?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion01=I have been waiting for you. Are you ready to fulfill your purpose?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Alarak00=Your schemes cannot compare to the Legion's machinations.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Alexstrasza00=I look forward to your efforts advancing the Legion's plans, dragon.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Angel00=When drained of their Light, the Naaru fall into darkness. Perhaps the same is true for you.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Arthas. When this is over, I will finally claim my vengeance.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Cassia00=How many years do you think you have left, warmatron? The Legion can offer you eternal life.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Chogall00=Go forth, Cho'gall, and redeem yourself in the eyes of the master.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=I have not met a demon like you before. The master will be interested in this.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Dreadlord00=Our plans have been set in motion. Are you ready for the final phase?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Guldan00=It is time to prove your worth, Gul'dan. Slay all who oppose us.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Illidan00=Ah, the Betrayer. I wonder, how would the master reward me if I brought him your head?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Ah, Jaina Proudmoore. If only you could have done more to save your precious Prince Arthas.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Johanna00=A crusader... I've found crusaders to be particularly easy to deceive.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_KelThuzad00=Never forget, Kel'Thuzad, that the scourge is a tool of the Legion. You will serve us.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=You seem to have a knack for violence. I would like to see it in action.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Legion00=This realm will bow to the Legion, or it will burn.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_LiMing00=Nathreza is home to the greatest archive of magical knowledge in the Twisting Nether. It could all be yours... if you join us.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Maiev00=The Legion is in your debt, warden. That vault of yours provided us with many powerful minions.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Medivh00=Your quest for redemption is futile, Medivh. You always have, and always will, belong to the Legion.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Bow to the Burning Legion.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Negative01=The Dark Titan has sent you to me... despite my protest.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Negative02=Weak little mortal. You will have to do.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Orc00=You orcs had such potential. And you could unlock it again, if you accept our generous offer.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Excellent. Someone who can play their part.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Positive01=It seems fate conspires against our foes.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Positive02=You seem promising. Let's see what you can do, shall we?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Scourge00=Are you ready to serve your masters?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=We're more alike than you care to admit, paladin. I too was betrayed by Arthas Menethil.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Valla00=You call yourself a demon hunter? You are nothing before the Legion.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Varian Wrynn. Would you like to know how you die?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Whitemane00=Ready to do a dreadlord's bidding, inquisitor? It wouldn't be the first time.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Yrel00=The Dark Titan is pleased with your people's contributions to the Legion. Would you like to know how many worlds they have destroyed?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroQuestion_Zuljin00=The orcs proved to be a disappointment. Perhaps your people would be more... satisfactory.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroRespond00=I am more prepared for this than you know.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroRespond01=This will be a fine test, mortal.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroRespond02=The Dark Titan would not have sent me otherwise.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=A true manipulator tricks no one. We simply lead them to the truth they have yet to accept.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=Do not mistake me for that fool Lothraxion. My alliance with the Light is only temporary.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=You will come to regret that sooner than you think.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Yes, young prince. You failed to kill me. I will not make the same mistake.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=<Reuses Respond02>
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Cassia00=Very well. I would hate to stand between you and your violent death.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Chogall00=Oh, it will be. Once I tear you in half for deserting the Legion.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Why settle for a single world, when so many are ripe for conquest?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Brave words. Unfortunately for you, that's all they are.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Dreadlord00=I'd prefer it if we manipulated these fools into destroying each other. But I suppose more... direct action is acceptable.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_FearNot00=Fear not. I will kill our enemies before I kill you.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=That's what your father said. At first.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Gibberish00=This is why all who join the Legion are required to learn demonic.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Guldan00=See that they do. Our patience with you grows thin.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Illidan00=You have always been a pawn in a larger game.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=You have no idea how right you are.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Johanna00=That implies we don't revel in conflict for its own sake, mortal.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_JohannaOrc00=Ally? No. Your kind will always be subordinate to the Legion.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_KelThuzad00=Is that so? Then I will exterminate them.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Are you absolutely certain you're not an Aranasi?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Laugh00=<Reuses Laugh00_02>
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Legion00=Manach sheek-thrish!
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=<Reuses IntroQuestion_Negative00>
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_LiMing00=Your belief is irrelevant. Do not disappoint me.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Maiev00=<Malicious laughter>Is that so? I was not aware you possessed a sense of humor, Shadowsong.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Manipulative00=I acknowledge your power, mortal. Take pride in it. Revel in it. Use it for the Legion.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Medivh00=The Dark Titan cares nothing for your pitiful hope. You will serve him again in the end.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Fear not. I will kill our enemies before I kill you.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Negative01=Do you think it's a coincidence that we are allies? You will be turned.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Negative02=The only reason you still live is because you are of use to me. For now.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=We will devour their hope.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Positive01=I look forward to this feast.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Positive02=The battle is already won.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Samuro00=Your blade? The one that butchered so many innocent lives at our command? <Laughs>I am not the source of your disgrace.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Scourge00=We created your kind as a precursor to our own invasion. You were made to be expendable.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=I must thank you, Uther, for molding Arthas into a man who was so easy to corrupt.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Valla00=Do not mistake me for the demons you know. I am far more dangerous.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=And yet you do so willingly. Your journey into darkness has already begun.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=<Dark laughter>If only you knew.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Yrel00=Do you have any idea how many nathrezim have already secured your trust?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/IntroResponse_Zuljin00=What makes you think we weren't your "loa" to begin with?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Kill00=Anach kyree!
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Kill01=All too easy.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Kill02=Your death is in vain.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Kill03=Your time has come to an end.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Kill04=Is that all?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/KillArthas00=This is where your journey ends, boy.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/KillDreadlord00=Is this how Varimathras felt?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/KillJaina00=Join your beloved in death.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/KillKelThuzad00=It was unwise of you to side with Arthas.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/KillScarlet00=You outlived your usefulness.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Enough! Your killing spree ends here.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/KillUther00=And now your failure is complete, Lightbringer.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Laugh00=<Evil laughter>
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Laugh01=<Evil laughter>
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Laugh02=<Evil laughter>
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Laugh03=<Evil laughter>

VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Laugh12=<Evil laughter>
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Laugh13=<Evil laughter>
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Laugh14=<Evil laughter>
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Laugh15=<Evil laughter>
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/LowLifeHeal00=You have earned my favor, healer.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/LowLifeHeal01=That was too close.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/LowLifeHeal02=Could you have taken any longer?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/LowMana00=I need more mana.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/LowMana01=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/LowMana02=Provide me with mana.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/MatchEnd00=Ah, you recognize power when you see it.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/MatchEnd01=This was but a taste of the Legion's might.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/MatchEnd02=Embrace the darkness, and be rewarded.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/No01=I will not do that.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/No02=Think about what you're asking.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_AssistHero00=It seems our ally needs help.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I call upon your aid, mortal.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Assist me at once.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=It is time. Destroy the core.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Turn these mercenaries to our side.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Crush their fort.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Take control of this watch tower.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend our core.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=If that fort falls, so shall you.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Keep this watch tower in our grasp.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Ping_KillHero00=Kill them.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed00=You call on me?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed01=What is it now?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed02=I watched Varian die on the Broken Shore. Admittedly, I didn't do much after that, but I was there!
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed03=So many people mistake me for Varimathras that I've just started signing his autograph when they ask me for one. It's easier than correcting them.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed04=I heard that the Black Dragonflight tried to destroy Stormwind by disguising one of their own as a high-ranking official. Hmph. I suppose imitation is the highest form of flattery.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed05=You'd think that after Balnazaar, the Scarlet Crusade would have started vetting their leadership more carefully.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed06=For the last time, I am Mal'Ganis. I am NOT a turtle, I am ETERNAL.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed07=A word of advice. The ability to incapacitate your enemies is extremely valuable. I wouldn't sleep on it if I were you.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed08=Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of the work I did with the plague of undeath. But Hakkar the Soulflayer's Corrupted Blood? Now THAT was a plague!
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed09=It is forbidden for one nathrezim to kill another. Granted, the penalty is just a citation and small fine, but it goes on your permanent demonic record.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed10=I wanted to storm Icecrown Citadel and claim my revenge on Arthas, but... I could never get a group together. If only flexible raiding had existed back then!
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed11=Are you enjoying this, mortal? Wasting valuable time clicking on me so you can hear these jokes? You're not recording this, are you?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed12=Have you heard the one about the nathrezim baker? He was a bread lord.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed13=No, seriously, that's why we used infected grain to spread the plague of undeath. It was his thing.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed14=<SFX: Phone ringing>Yes? Oh, hello Darkness. My old friend. Have you called to talk to me again? <Pause, then sighs>No. I still don't have the Demon Hunter's number. Ask the other one.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Pissed_Turtle00=For the last time, I am Mal'Ganis. I am NOT eternal, I am a TURTLE! Well, technically a tortollan, but still! 
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Resurrected00=Did they really think I would stay dead?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Resurrected01=You can never truly kill a demon.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Revive00=I am Mal'Ganis. I am eternal!
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Revive01=I have gathered my strength.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Revive02=Enough of my time has been wasted.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Revive_Turtle00=I am Mal'ganis. I am a turtle!
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Sleep00=Time out.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Sleep01=You seem tired.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Sleep02=Sleep now.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Spec00=Clever.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Spec01=Well chosen.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Spec02=My strength gathers.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Spec03=The Dark Titan grants me power.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Spec04=Interesting.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Taunt00=I will crush the life from you.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Taunt01=Face the might of the Nathrezim.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/Taunt02=It has been too long since I tore someone apart.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/TeamKilled00=We will have our revenge.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/UI_ExLocked00=Fear the nathrezim.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Heed the voice of the Dark Titan.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/UI_Gift00=Your generosity is impressive. And also a weakness.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/UI_Lockin00=I must feed.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/UI_Purchase00=Your journey has just begun.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/UI_Trial00=Witness the strength of a dread lord.
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/UI_Trial01=Can your mortal mind comprehend this power?
VoiceOver/MalGanisBase/UI_WaitLocked00=What would you give for true power?
