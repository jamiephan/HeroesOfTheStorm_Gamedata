VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Attack00=We've got to attack, now.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Attack01=Uhm, aren't we supposed to attack?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Attack02=Now's the time to attack! Let's go!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Caution00=Stay wary. Danger lurks nearby.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_GoodJob00=That's it!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_GoodJob01=Exceptional work. Let's keep it up.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_GoodJob02=Precisely as it should be.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Heal00=Oh, no. <grossed out exertion> You should undo those wounds.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Heal01=Uhm, look, you're going to do what you want... But maybe try healing this time?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Retreat00=Time to make my retreat.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Retreat01=Oh, I need to be somewhere else!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Uhoh00=We'll have to attempt that again. Yeah...
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Uhoh01=Hey, you weren't supposed to die!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/AI_Uhoh02=Knew that would happen.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Attack00=Uhm. Sorry about this!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Attack01=All right, now I attack this one...
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Attack02=Goodnight!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Attack03=Time to take things into my own hands.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Attack04=The timestream won't repair itself.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Attack05=Here we go!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Attack06=I am more powerful than I appear, you know!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Celebrate00=Yay!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Celebrate01=Marvelous work everyone!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Comeback00=It's working! Keep fighting, we're changing our fate!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Death00=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Death01=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Death02=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Death03=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Death04=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Death05=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Death06=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Healed00=Oh, you've undone my wounds! Thank you!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Healed01=Excellent healing, friend!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Healed02=I knew I could rely on you.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroAgree00=We're a force to be reckoned with.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroAgree01=On a long enough timeline everything works out!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroAgree02=Huh? Oh! I'm sorry, (giggle) I got distracted. Let's just do... uh, whatever you said.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroBoast00=I've got the most excellent feeling about this timeline!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroBoast01=Almost time! Let's give it our all, friends!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroQuestion00=I remember this! First, I say "Are you ready?" And then, you respond...
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroQuestion01=Have I asked if you're ready yet? Oh, and if not, are you?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroQuestion_Aspect00=Oh my, an Aspect! This is quite an honor!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroQuestion_Brightwing00=Hi, Brightwing! Uh, you do remember that I'm not food, right?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroQuestion_Confused00=Do we know each other? Oh, sorry. Ugh, I always forget these things!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Oh! Hi, Murky!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Oh, that's right... I have to fight with you. I'd almost forgotten. Almost.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Oh, hello friend! So wonderful to see you again!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroQuestion_Tracer00=Oh, I seen this before... you're unstuck in time! I can fix that, you know!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroRespond00=Absolutely, I've been ready hundreds of times now.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroRespond01=I just realized... I--I can't recall if we win this battle! ...Huh.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroRespond02=Most assuredly. But, you... well... just be careful, okay?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=One of these days you're finally going to shut up, I just have to believe it!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Aspect00=You... you know my name? Oh goodness, I never expected this!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Brightwing00=You don't have to ask me that every time, you know.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Cliche00=Heard that before. <sigh> And I will again the next time you say it.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Cliche01=That gets old fast... And then stays old... forever.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Cliche02=<faking laughter> That gets more difficult to laugh at every time.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=No matter how many times you say that, it still isn't true.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=Even I can't wait for that!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_GivesUp00=It's not worth arguing with you, heh. I am so tired of trying.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Happy00=Hah! You always know just how to make me smile!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Eh. I wouldn't worry your head about it. Most of them never learn to understand you, anyways.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=I am so sorry for how many times you're about to die. (sigh) I can't lie, that's not true.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_NotNice00=Well that's not nice!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Don't worry, we make it through this one. I think. You know, all these battles blend together!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_RespondYou00=Yep. And you're you!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Tracer00=Yeah, I have that effect on things... and time in general.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Yes00=Oh, that will be great!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/IntroResponse_Yrel00=<DO NOT RECORD. REUSES A DEFAULT INTRO RESPONSE.>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Kill00=If it's any consolation, you'll be alive again soon!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Kill01=Your time just ran out!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Kill02=Sorry, but that's how it goes.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Kill03=Wonderful! Everything worked out. (happy sigh)
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Kill04=Yay, I did it!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillAlreadyDead00=Oh, no... That's definitely going to cause a paradox.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillAuriel00=Whoa. Does anyone else feel melancholy all of a sudden?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillChogall00=Two for one!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillChromie00=Oh, that's going to hurt later... or perhaps earlier!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillChromie01=Another paradox resolved.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillChromie02=I sure hope that was the right Chromie.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillD3Demon00=And I thought OUR demons were mean.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillGuldan00=Was that Gul'dan from the main timeline or the alternate one? Ugh, I always forget.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Uhm, Wait. Wasn't that supposed to be the tough one?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillStitches00=Yuck.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/KillTracer00=It's your turn for a time out, Tracer!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Laugh00=<giggle>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Laugh01=<giggle>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Laugh02=<Medium laugh>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Laugh03=<Medium laugh>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Laugh04=<Hearty laugh>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Laugh05=<Hearty laugh>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Laugh06=<Hearty laugh>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Laugh07=<Satisfied laugh after taking down an enemy>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/LowLifeHeal00=And I thought I was the master of timing!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/LowLifeHeal01=Wow. That was close, huh?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/LowLifeHeal02=Oh, thank you! You're wonderful!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/LowMana00=Right, mana! Yup, I knew I there was something missing.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/LowMana01=Uhn-uh. I need mana.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/LowMana02=Sorry, that requires too much mana.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/No00=Uhm, look... It's easier on the timeline if I just tell you no.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/No01=I'm sorry, but that's just not what happens.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/No02=Uhn-uh. That would create a paradox.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/No03=No. I can't!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our friend's in peril! Let's fix that!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Uh, can someone help me?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_AssistMe01=I'm sorry, I can't quite do this alone.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=The core. Attack the core!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Now's the perfect time for some mercenary friends.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=We should destroy this fort.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Let's capture this watch tower.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend the core!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=We've got to defend this fort.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Don't let the enemy take this watch tower.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ping_KillHero00=Ugh, that hero's mucking up the timestream. Stop them!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed00=Oh hi, it's good to see you!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed01=Or is this the first time we've met? I'm in so many places and times I have a hard time keeping track of all of it.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed02=You know, I don't understand why you mortals get so upset over spoilers. I know everything all the time and I don't complain.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed03=Time... space... Oh, it's all the same to me.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed04=Oh, hold on a moment... <SFX: Off mic and hard to hear:> You found them! Well done, hero! (mumbling) <SFX: Back on mic:> <clears throat> Sorry about the distraction, someone was turning in a quest! Whoops, I think I might have shortchanged them some silver, oh well.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed05=Look, a butterfly! Wait... Uh oh. Nobody step on it! I mean, unless you REALLY like dinosaurs that is.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed06=Hmm... I wonder if you could make a time-machine out of steam tank. I mean, if you're going to time-travel you might as well do it in style!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed07=Just to be clear, time is not a flat circle... That is way too simplistic. It's a little more wibbly-wobbly than that.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed08=Where do Bronze Dragons come from? Well, (giggle) when a copper dragon and a tin dragon love each other very much-- Huh? OHHH, what location? Oh, we come from the Caverns of Time... <nervous laugh> of course that's what you meant ...yeah.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed09=Everyone calls me Chromie, but my real name is Chronormu. Huh? (scoff) No, it is not a male name. You clearly don't understand the intricacies of dragon culture.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed10=(sigh) When you spend most of your existence as a colossal scaly dragon sometimes it's nice to be small and cute, you know?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed11=This Nexus is so peculiar. Heroes who are alive but should be dead... others from strange alternate timelines... When I discover who's tampered with the timestream they're going to be sorry.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed12=Time flows less like a stream and more like a vortex in this place. Everything repeats over and over again and yet nobody notices but you and me.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed13=I don't even want to think about how many times I've heard that Blackheart guy tell that corny booty joke.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed14=<excited inhale> I just had a thought. What if we're stuck in a time loop? Hmm, try clicking on me again... Let's see what happens.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed15=<SFX: Repeat of the first line "Oh hi, it's good to see you!"> Yeah, that's what I was afraid of... definitely some sort of looping going on.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed16=To solve this we'll have to go to the past, then back to the future, then further into the future... Then to an alternate timeline? Then back to the past AGAIN... then further back into the past? Hmm... Maybe we should just let time stay broken.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Pissed17=Oh, well... If I start repeating myself feel free to overlook it. It's probably safer that way.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Resurrected00=Neat trick! And it doesn't even cause a paradox!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Resurrected01=Oof, still a little sore! But oh, you did a great job!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Revive00=Okay, Chromie... let's not make that mistake again next time.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Revive01=<Frustrated exertion> That wasn't supposed to happen!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Revive02=It's past time we got serious.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Revive03=Ugh, I know that's supposed to happen, but I still hate it.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Spec00=Oh, I love that talent!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Spec01=That's right! Magnificent!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Spec02=Perfect! Yes! That's the ability! I almost forgot.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Spec03=Ooo, that one? Are you aware of something I'm not?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Spec04=Terrific choice!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Taunt00=<Cute Roar>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Taunt01=<Cute Roar>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/TeamKilled00=Ah, it's okay. We get revenge later. I can't remember how much later, but it happens!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_ExLocked00=Hi! We meet again!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Everything is just a matter of time.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_Gift00=Great idea!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_Lockin00=Here we go again!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_Purchase00=We make the perfect team! Trust me.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_Trial00=Ooh-ooh-ooh! Can we go visit the target dummy? That's my favorite part.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_Trial01=Training? Oh! This is going to be so exciting!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_Vox_Spun00=<Dizzy Exertions>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_Vox_Spun01=<Dizzy Exertions>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_Vox_Spun02=<Dizzy Exertions>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_Vox_Spun03=<Dizzy Exertions>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_Vox_Spun04=<Dizzy Exertions>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_WaitLocked00=<laughs> Oh, I'm sorry. I was just remembering a joke (laughs while talking)I tell you in the future. You're going to love it.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_WaitLocked01=If you don't mind I'm going to leap forward in time a little bit... <SFX: Fast forwarding sound> Wow! You're still here?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Oh, excuse me, I'm just going to go help to this hero in Dragonblight real fast.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Wow... waiting in sequential time gets dull fast. How do you mortals do it?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ultimate1Used00=Slowing the Sands of Time!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ultimate1Used01=This should slow things down.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ultimate1Used02=Time warp!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ultimate1Used03=Power of the Bronze Dragonflight!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ultimate2Used00=Let's rewind.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ultimate2Used01=No, no, no! You're not supposed to be there.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ultimate2Used02=Back in time with you!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Ultimate2Used03=See you in a few moments!

VoiceOver/ChromieBase/VoiceLineThree00=Yay!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/VoiceLineTwo00=Oh hi, it's good to see you!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/WorthIt00=We got them anyway!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/WorthIt01=Ha! Nothing can stop us!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Yes00=Hmm. Haven't I done this before?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Yes01=Yes! That's right. <small chuckle>
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Yes02=So much left to be done...
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Yes03=We have all the time in the world.
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Yes04=This way again? Or is this the first time?
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Yes05=Ah, of course!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Yes06=Oh, we're almost to my favorite part!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Yes07=Let's get moving!
VoiceOver/ChromieBase/Yes08=(to self) Oh no, I'm late.
