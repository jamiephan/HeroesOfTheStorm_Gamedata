VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroQuestion_Terran00=Hail, terran. We appear to be on the same side... today.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroQuestion_Yrel00=Hmm. I've never seen a protoss like you before. Which tribe do you belong to?
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroQuestion_Zeratul00=It seems we face a worthy foe, Zeratul. This will be a welcome challenge.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Be ready, abomination. I will not wait for you.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroRespond00=My heart longs for an epic battle.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroRespond01=I am Akun-delar, the tip of the spear!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroRespond02=If it betters our chances, I will lead the assault myself.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=Nor does an honorless traitor, Tal'darim!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=There is only so much I will tolerate from you!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroResponse_Artanis00=Ah, Executor! En taro Adun! It is good to see you once more upon the field of battle.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=I do not understand you. Which is troubling, since we are communicating psionically.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroResponse_DVa00=StarCraft? No, I am from Aiur!

VoiceOver/FenixBase/IntroResponse_Gibberish00=How glad I am that the Firstborn do not speak through an orifice.

VoiceOver/FenixBase/KillRaynor00=You were as valorous as any Templar, friend Raynor.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/KillSpreeEnd00=I will tolerate your impudence no longer!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/KillTassadar00=At least it was done by my hand, and not the Conclave's.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/KillTerran00=If only all terrans were as bold as Raynor.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/KillZeratul00=You brought honor to the Dark Templar, my friend.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/KillZerg00=Another step closer to the zerg's extinction.

VoiceOver/FenixBase/Laugh02=<Confident laugh>
VoiceOver/FenixBase/LowLifeHeal00=I owe you much, healer.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/LowLifeHeal01=I almost died. Again.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/LowLifeHeal02=That could have ended much worse.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/LowMana00=My mana is low.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/LowMana01=Insufficient mana.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/LowMana02=I require more mana.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/MatchEnd00=You honor me, fellow warriors.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/MatchEnd01=I humbly accept your praise.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/MatchEnd02=This victory belongs to us all!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/No00=That cannot be done.

VoiceOver/FenixBase/No02=I cannot comply.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally needs our help!

VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed03=I fear not death, for our strength is eternal.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed04=Drop your weapon! You have 15 seconds to comply!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed05=I am honored to have been made into a dragoon, but I wish the phase-smiths would clean my tank once in a while. I think I saw a fish in here!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed06=For the last time, I do not have a graviton beam! You are thinking of a different protoss phoenix.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed07=Before I fell to the zerg, Judicator Aldaris sent me to Glacius to have my memories preserved. I... may have altered the archives to embellish a few of my accomplishments. I'm sure no one will notice. Right?
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed08=Have you seen those new "immortals"? With their torsos and dual phase disruptors? Hmph. In my day, we had no torso, and one phase disruptor! And we appreciated it!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed09=At the end of my last stand in Antioch, I was ambushed by a hydralisk. I could have easily slain it, but my psi blade... ceased to function. I swear that never happened before!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed10=I live, I die, I live again!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed11=Never underestimate the strength of a dragoon. With just a single shield battery, one dragoon can defeat an entire terran army! It's true, look it up.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed12=This exoskeleton can be extremely difficult to control. Do not judge a dragoon by the paths they choose to walk!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed13=My most recent battle was one to remember. I was having a shield day.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed14=So, Artanis is a Hierarch now? Most impressive! <Pause>What's a Hierarch?
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed15=There is no need to continue clicking me. That hold position bug was fixed ages ago!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Pissed16=It breaks my heart to see my fellow zealots suffer on the battlefield. But what if we dragoons went to their rescue? Duh! Ra! Goon!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Resurrected00=Show me my enemy!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Resurrected01=You have brought me back!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Revive00=I can still serve!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Revive01=My spirit cannot be conquered!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Revive02=I live to fight again!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Spec00=Excellent choice.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Spec01=I will make use of this.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Spec02=This cold shell has been improved.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Spec03=Let my foes tremble before me!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Spec04=Our phase-smiths never cease to impress.
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Taunt00=Face me!
VoiceOver/FenixBase/Taunt01=You dare contest the Templar?
