Character/Race/Medivh=Human
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Attack00=Now is the time to strike.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Attack01=You must attack at once.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Attack02=Attacking now will work to our advantage.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Caution00=Beware. I sense danger nearby.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_GoodJob00=Expertly done.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_GoodJob01=It seems I've chosen my allies wisely.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_GoodJob02=Your skill is admirable.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Heal00=You must seek out a healing fountain.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Heal01=Heal yourself before it's too late.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Retreat00=I must fall back for now.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Retreat01=It is time I returned to our core.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Uhoh00=One of our own has fallen.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Uhoh01=That was... most unfortunate.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/AI_Uhoh02=They really should have listened to me.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Attack00=Away with you.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Attack01=You will not stand in my way.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Attack02=For Azeroth.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Attack03=Your time grows short.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Attack04=Be gone.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Attack05=I will deal with you myself.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Attack06=It is time to act.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Celebrate00=Excelsior!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Celebrate01=Fate smiles upon us!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Celebrate02=Well done!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Comeback00=It seems our plans are falling into place. Press onward!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Death00=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Death01=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Death02=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Death03=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Death04=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Death05=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Death06=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Healed00=Thank you, healer.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Healed01=Exemplary healing.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Healed02=I will endeavor to return the favor.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroAgree00=Our victory is assured.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroAgree01=The day will be ours.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroAgree02=I could not have said it better myself.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroBoast00=Nothing can stop us. Nothing.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroBoast01=Knowledge is power, and I know that we shall succeed.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion00=Are you prepared for the trials ahead?
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion01=I pray you are ready for what's to come.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=I warned you against staying in Lordaeron, Arthas. Look upon all your arrogance has wrought.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=I had hoped to never consort with demons again.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Gul'dan00=When we last worked together, we nearly brought an entire world to ruin. That will not happen again.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Hearthstone00=<Reuses UI_Lockin>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=It's been a while, young sorceress. And yet I know I can still rely on you.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Kael'thas00=Trust me, Kael'thas. Collaborating with demons always ends poorly.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=We stand together once again, Malfurion.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=A murloc, are you? Well, this should be interesting.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=You? I see fate can make for some unlikely allies.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Orc00=Your people were noble once. Are you ready to prove that they are once again?
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=My fate must be a bright one, to have an ally such as you.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Prophet00=<DO NOT RECORD. RESUSE A HELLO>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=So we meet again, young warchief.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroQuestion_Wizard00=I must admit, you are quite adept at the arcane. For one so young and childish.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroRespond00=I shall atone for all I have done.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroRespond01=You have my guidance.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroRespond02=We shall write our own fate.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=I am giving you a warning. Your fate is now your own.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Yes, I have returned once again. Too late for you, it seems.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Defensive00=I know I have made mistakes in the past. I am here to correct them.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Speak to me only when necessary, demon.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Hmm, how droll.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Gul'dan00=This "alliance" is only temporary.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=One day, young sorceress, you will be the greatest mage of all.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Kael'thas00=Yes, it is. My death wasn't quite the setback that yours was.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=And to you, archdruid. I see your connection to nature has grown.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Mmm. Yes. Right! Right, I--I have no idea what you just said.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=I suppose we both have little choice in the matter.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Orc00=Remember, orc: I, too, know the indignity of demonic corruption.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=All of my knowledge and all of my power are at your service.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Well, I see that this shall be a productive endeavor.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Surprised00=Can it be? Even I could not foresee this intertwining of fates.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=I always knew you'd find your destiny, Thrall.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/IntroResponse_Wizard00=I'll have you know these spells are still perfectly efficacious!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Kill00=Let that be a lesson to you.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Kill01=You left me no choice.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Kill02=My magic is not to be trifled with.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Kill03=I did what had to be done.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Kill04=Your fate is sealed.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillAlliance00=Even now, it seems death follows in my wake.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillArthas00=Perhaps next time you'll listen, boy.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillDemon00=I will banish every demon I encounter.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillGul'dan00=I should have done that to begin with!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillJaina00=It seems you still have much to learn, Lady Proudmoore.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillKael'thas00=You like to boast, Sunstrider. But even now you are no match for my magic.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillMalfurion00=You will heal in time, archdruid.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillMedivh00=Did anyone else hear an echo?
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillOrc00=I brought you into Azeroth, and I can take you out of it!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillSpreeEnd00=That's enough from you.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillThrall00=The sands of time have run out, son of Durotan.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/KillWizard00=I was once like you. Both the arrogance and the dying.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Laugh00=<Bemused chuckle>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Laugh01=<Bemused chuckle>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Laugh02=<Hearty, good natured laugh>

VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Laugh07=<Hearty, good natured laugh>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Laugh08=<Enigmatic, knowing laugh>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Laugh09=<Aggressive laugh>
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/LowLifeHeal00=You have my eternal gratitude.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/LowLifeHeal01=It seems you were the guardian, today.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/LowLifeHeal02=Not a moment too soon. Thank you.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/LowMana00=I am low on mana.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/LowMana01=My mana is expended.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/LowMana02=I need more mana.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/No00=Impossible.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/No01=That cannot be done.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/No02=I will not do that.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally is in need of aid.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I cannot do this alone. I need your help.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Stand with me against our foe.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=The time has come to attack the enemy's core.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Defeat these mercenaries, so that they might join us.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Lay siege to the enemy's fort.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Claim this watch tower, and be granted the gift of vision.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Our core must not fall!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=The enemy moves against our fort.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Maintain control of this watch tower.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ping_KillHero00=Vanquish this foe.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed00=Yes?
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed01=Speak your mind.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed02=No, you don't need to stay awhile and listen. You must have me confused with someone else.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed03=Rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated. I mean, yes, I died. But people love to embellish.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed04=In my day, heroes only had one ultimate to choose from! And they were grateful for it!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed05=I was once possessed by the demon lord Sargeras, used as an unwitting vessel for his dark and infernal soul... but now I'm as free as a bird.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed06=Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian, is a unique and powerful artifact passed down from Guardian to apprentice for generations.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed07=Pay no attention to that druid holding another one. Or that priest. Or Khadgar. In fact, never pay attention to Khadgar.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed08=I had a theatre custom built within the walls of Karazhan. The troupe performed one of three shows at random for me each week. Strangely, it was never the one I wanted to see.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed09=The spell is called "polymorph" because with a little practice, you can technically transform someone into any animal. Most mages are simply too sheepish to give it a try. 
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed10=I don't see why everyone is so distrusting of this "Raven Lord." He seems a perfectly fine fellow to me. Of course, birds of a feather do flock together.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed11=An upside down version of Karazhan? Buried under the real tower? Well, that's absolutely insane! Only a madman would do such a... oh, wait...
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed12=Ghost pirates? Grave golems? Spider queens? Forget Draenor, Sargeras should have opened a Dark Portal to the Nexus!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed13=I call myself "the Prophet," but in truth there is no prophecy to fulfill. I suppose you could say I'm just winging it.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Pissed14=You're telling me Khadgar flew in as a raven and transformed in front of the king to deliver a dire warning? <Sniffs> That's my boy! ...Or he was, until I turned him into an old man, that is.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Resurrected00=You have brought me back, and I thank you.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Resurrected01=It seems death is not yet an option for me.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Revive00=Not the first time I've come back from the dead.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Revive01=I cannot depart just yet. There is work to be done.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Revive02=Hm. Didn't see that one coming...
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Revive03=This conflict has not yet reached its conclusion.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Spec00=Yes... I see now...
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Spec01=A wise decision.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Spec02=Yes... Things become clearer.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Spec03=Even now, my power grows.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Spec04=I will use this well.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Taunt00=Yours is a transparent stratagem.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Taunt01=Know that I have seen the future, and you are not in it.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Taunt02=I was murdered by my closest friends. Your fate will be much worse.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/TeamKilled00=Do not give in to despair. We must prevail!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_ExLocked00=My youth may be over, but my task is not.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_ExPurchased00=I will not fail humanity again!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_Gift00=I go where I am needed.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_Homescreen00=Gone is the brash young man I used to be. 
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_Lockin00=Let the games begin.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_Purchase00=Destiny is at hand.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_Trial00=I will reveal what the future holds.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_Trial01=The wisdom you seek is mine to share.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Hesitation is the bane of destiny.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Do not tarry. Make your choice, and make it well.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=One must not become too complacent.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=We are wasting time here.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ultimate1Used00=Ah, the whimsical flows of magic!
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ultimate1Used01=Time for a change.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ultimate1Used02=I still have a few tricks up my sleeve.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ultimate2Used00=Checkmate.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ultimate2Used01=Stay your hand.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Ultimate2Used02=You've wasted enough of my time.

VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Yes02=Fate waits for none of us.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Yes03=A great shadow looms.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Yes04=I see visions... and nightmares.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Yes05=The winds of change are howling.
VoiceOver/MedivhBase/Yes06=My destiny awaits.
