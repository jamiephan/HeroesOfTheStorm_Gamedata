Character/Description/NexusHunter=NexusHunter is an elite warrior from the nation of Iresia, the most advanced and powerful realm in the Nexus. At least, it was, until division and strife led to such a violent conflict that it tore their nation and the entire world apart. Awaking alone within the unfamiliar wilderness of another plane of existence, Qhira was forced to adapt and survive in a hostile and far more primitive new world. Now, years later, she has established herself as a mercenary... a bounty hunter: willing to take any job she deems fit. This is the side she shows the world, an efficient and calculating hunter that can surmount any challenge. Yet in truth, she is hiding away a pain that constantly eats away at her... a desperate desire to find other survivors of her world's destruction. And she is willing to pay any price to do so.

VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_ETC00=You look familiar... hmm... Have I seen you before?
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_IEvil00=Understand this... I know you're alive now... and I will rectify that.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Imperius00=All that gold armor had best not be for show.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Iresia00=You're Iresian? I-I thought I might be the only one who survived...
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=You remind me of an ancient Iresian creature. Before they went extinct due to stupidity, that is.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=You? <angry exertion> So be it.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Negative01=Well, this will make things harder.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Negative02=I know it's hard for you, but try not to get in my way.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Orphea00=The battlefield is no place for children...
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Overwatch00=Interesting. Your fashion indicates a slightly more advanced society than these others. Slightly.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=This should be an effective partnership.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Positive01=Let's bring them down together.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Positive02=Good, you seem trustworthy.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Sister00=Of the trillion souls in our realm that could have survived... it had to be you...
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Sonya00=I know I call everyone barbarians, but... you are taking a bit too literally.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Valla00=So you only hunt demons? How... limiting.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=So you are this "Lo'Gosh" I've heard the orcs speak of. I expected an actual ghost wolf.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroRespond00=There is no need to make small talk. It's fine.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroRespond01=I have fought countless battles across as many stars. This, does not concern me.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroRespond02=I will get my target. That is what matters.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=I am not a terran. And I won't be an ally either, if that attitude persists.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Anduin00=Some causes are hopeless. Stick with what you're good at.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=You are going to pay for that.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Angry01=Are you this desperate for a sixth enemy right now?
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Blaze00=Yes. Real combat training. Not whatever you're doing.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=That is honestly horrifying. Go do that to our enemy.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=Stop, that's annoying.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Confused01=What? Are you talking?
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=That is enough of that.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss01=<sigh>

VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Imperius00=I have my mission. And it doesn't involve being judged by you.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Iresia00=I can't believe someone else survived... After the battle, you must tell me everything! Spare no detail!
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Joking00=<small chuckle> That's hilarious. Oh, you're serious? Ah.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Did that hurt? Because it sounds like that hurt...
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Good thing I'm used to working alone.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Negative01=Do us all a favor and be silent.

VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_OrpheaTwo00=And this cruel multiverse will simply create more. Whether we desire to be here or not.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=This job's good as done.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Positive01=You? Well, let's get our mark then.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Positive02=I've got your back.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Primitive00=It never ceases to surprise me how truly primitive you can be.

VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/IntroResponse_Silent00=You can be silent, yes?

VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillDemon00=Hellish brute.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillDragon00=Killing a dragon has to be worth some kind of bonus...
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillEvil00=From one monster to another: good riddance.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillEvil01=Not surprising that one was on the list.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillEvil02=That's my good deed for the day, I suppose.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillGood00=You have been making powerful enemies.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillGood01=Ideals get you killed.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillGood02=On some days, I am the bad guy.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillHanzo00=Simple subtraction.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillIEvil00=Justice didn't come for you. I did.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillMaiev00=<Scoff> Watch more closely next time.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillMalthael00=Killing death is a bit surreal for my tastes.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillOrphea00=Someone needs more practice running away.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillOrphea01=Go away and don't come back.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillOverwatch00=Hm, that one was a bit less primitive than most.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillSister00=Not even your death absolves my sins.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Killing spree ended. That should be worth a decent reward.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillStukov00=Keep that arm away from me.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/KillTerran00=All that bulky power armor. How quaint.

VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Merc camp. Now.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=We should take out this fort.

VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Let's keep this watch tower under our control.

VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed01=Do you require something?
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed02=If you're trying to arrange a deal there are proper channels for that... This is not one of them.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed03=What are you doing? Why are you clicking on me?
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed04=Have you ever been clicked on over and over again? No?  Well, it's annoying.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed05=What are you expecting? Jokes? For me to divulge the intricate details of my life? Well, maybe for the right price.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed06=You call the crystals singularities? But... why? There are multiple! Oh, what am I thinking... you people make no sense. What did I expect?
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed07=When a problem comes along, I tend to whip it. And I whip it good.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed08=What are the knives for? Try not to find out.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed09=Fur isn't usually my style... but considering what this beast tried to do to me, I'd say we're even.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed10=Bounty hunters. We are people who hunt people for people.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed11=It's not that I think I'm better than you... you all just have... A LOT to learn.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed12=There is nothing more frustrating than being smarter, faster, and stronger than everyone else, and yet still being unable to change things. Or... save anyone.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Pissed13=Who am I? I am a woman whose world was destroyed, her people scattered to the winds or lost forever... my life is the last whisper of a beautiful dream. And now I alone carry it forward. Now, leave me be.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Resurrected00=I've rematerialized? Well done, indeed.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Resurrected01=Now to find whoever did that and make them pay.
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Revive00=So I survive even this? I see..
VoiceOver/NexusHunterBase/Revive01=Back to business.
