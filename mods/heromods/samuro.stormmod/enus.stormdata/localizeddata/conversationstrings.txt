VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion00=Are you ready to fight?
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion01=A true warrior must always be ready for battle. Are you?
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion_Chen00=A blademaster and a brewmaster. We fight together, as one.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Your presence brings us disgrace. Keep your distance, or my blade will keep it for you.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion_FeudalAlarak00=Your warrior's guile is impressive. Do not let it overshadow your warrior's honor.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion_Guldan00=Your demon worshiping ruined our people and dishonored my clan. I should cut off your head here and now!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion_Horde00=I seek vengeance for my clan, but glory for the Horde.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Not all who wander are lost, my friends.

VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion_RoninZeratul00=Ah, another disciple of the blade. I am eager to compare our skills.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion_ShogunArtanis00=Ah, a shogun who joins the battle himself. All leaders should be so bold.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion_Tassadar00=To sacrifice oneself for the greater good... it is an honor to fight beside such a warrior.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=This humble blademaster is honored to fight by his warchief's side.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroRespond00=For me, the battle has already begun.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroRespond01=A blademaster is always ready.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroRespond02=My every breath is a strike waiting to be made.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Your disrespect will not be tolerated!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Chen00=And the same to you, brewmaster. I look forward to seeing your technique once more.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Make no mistake, demon. I will never rely on the strength of your kind.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Hmph. Today calls for a strong wind. Not a gentle breeze.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_FeudalAlarak00=We will see which of us is the true master of the warrior's art.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Guldan00=Never. I will redeem the Burning Blade and break the chains you put upon us.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=Together, we fight as one. For the Horde!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=This "Tomator" must be a great warrior!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Medivh00=I prove it with every breath, thought, and action.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Monk00=And the spirits bring me honor with yours.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hmm. Your words are muddled, but your desire for vengeance is clear.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=So you have heard of the blademasters. Then you know not to cross me.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=This will be a good fight.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Rexxar00=Yes, it has. Our last parting was too hasty, my friend.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_RoninZeratul00=And to you, my fellow wanderer.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/IntroResponse_Sad00=No life is free of suffering. It is the hardest battle of them all.

VoiceOver/SamuroBase/KillRexxar00=Your wandering is over, brother.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/KillSamuro00=Oh! You were not one of my images!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/KillSpreeEnd00=You fought well. I fought better.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/KillThrall00=Not even a warchief can impede vengeance.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/KillWarrior00=It was an honor to fight one such as you.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/KillWisp00=It has been a while, little wisp.

VoiceOver/SamuroBase/LowLifeHeal02=An impressive heal!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/LowMana00=I'm low on mana.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/LowMana01=I need more mana.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/LowMana02=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/No00=Forgive me, but no.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/No01=Ho ho! You ask the impossible.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/No02=I must disobey.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally requires assistance.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Let us fight this battle together!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_AssistMe01=I cannot win this fight alone.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Finish this! Strike at the enemy's core!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Let us capture this mercenary camp.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=We must destroy this fort!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_AttackTower00=We should secure this watch tower.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend our core!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=This fort requires our defense.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Our forces should defend this watch tower.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ping_KillHero00=This hero must be cut down.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed00=I am yours.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed01=What task is there?
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed02=If on my journey, I should encounter the titans, then the titans shall be cut.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed03=If the warchief wishes my death, he has but to ask.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed04=Blademaster training is simple, yet effective: one hundred cuts, one hundred stabs, one hundred parries, ten miles of wandering. Every single day!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed05=Who's the meanest, the leanest, the greenest blademaster down in the Nexus? Samuro, the Shogun of Orgrimmar!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed06=I try not to be angry. But sometimes, I'm just beside myselves. <laugh>
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed07=Years ago, six other blademasters and I banded together and taught a mag'har village how to defend itself against forty ogre bandits. It was a long battle, but it was the finest that Draenor had ever seen.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed08=It is not easy to wield a burning blade. For many, they are too hot to handle.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed09=A true master of combat enters a state of "no mind" in battle. To react with speed and power, you must first empty your mind of all thoughts. So... you are already halfway there.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed10=My best sparring matches are against my own mirror images. I call them "Samuro Showdown".
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed11=The most skilled blademaster I have ever met was a blind orc who hid his blade within a cane. The next... uh... was dressed as a rabbit.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed12=This is the weapon of a blademaster. Not as random or clumsy as an axe; it is an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed13=The Burning Blade clan takes its name from an annual festival held in the middle of Hellfire Peninsula. I used to go every year, but now it has become WAY too commercialized.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Pissed14=No, "dude." I cannot get you backstage passes! I am Samuro! Not Samuro. Go ask E.T.C. himself then.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Resurrected00=Thank you, friend.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Resurrected01=I owe you my life.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Revive00=Once unsheathed, blood must be shed.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Revive01=My blade seeks vengeance.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Revive02=Every wound is a lesson. Every fight is a test.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Spec00=Very good.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Spec01=I see.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Spec02=Excellent choice.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Spec03=Vengeance closes in.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Spec04=Whoa! My training has paid off. <laugh>
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Taunt00=Be proud. Dying to a blademaster is a great honor.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Taunt01=The mind controls the body. You are weak in both.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Taunt02=Hmph. An unworthy opponent.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/TeamKilled00=We are not so easily broken!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_ExLocked00=You seek my blade?
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Yes, my lord?
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_Gift00=I go where I am needed.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_Lockin00=I hear and obey.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_Purchase00=Command my blade!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_Trial00=A decision tempered by wisdom.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_Trial01=You have much to learn.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_VOX_Spun00=<Dizzy and off-balance>
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_VOX_Spun01=<Dizzy and off-balance>

VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_VOX_Spun05=<Dizzy and off-balance>
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_VOX_Spun06=<Dizzy and off-balance>
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Without a hand to wield it, even the sharpest blade is worthless.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_WaitLocked01=A battle never fought cannot be won.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=My meditation has ended. My patience is next.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=True patience requires the bearing of the unbearable.
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ultimate1Used00=Ha ha! Bladestooorm!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ultimate1Used01=Meet your death!
VoiceOver/SamuroBase/Ultimate1Used02=You cannot stop me!

VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroAgree00=Agreed!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroAgree01=Ha, I could handle them by myself!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroAgree02=Allow me to take care of this! <chuckle>
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroBoast00=Do not fear! With me on your side, losing is impossible!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroBoast01=I am the Great Sage, Equal of Heaven! This will be a short battle.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion00=Are you ready to join Old Monkey in battle?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion01=The fight begins soon. Be ready!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Chen00=Ah, I can tell you have seen many battles! This will be a great fight!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Hmm, you're quite the troublesome deity, aren't you?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Guldan00=Why are you so hunched old, man? Hmm. Oh, I know! Are you sick?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Horde00=This world has many strange demons and beast-men. Who do you fight for?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Hmm, three of you? Three of me! A perfect match!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Medivh00=Crow-man! You fight with old monkey this time, yes? 
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Monk00=You're a monk? Are you sure? You must be from a temple faaar to the west! Way out there!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Ah, a fish! Finally! Monkey was getting hungry!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Oh, what did I do to deserve being stuck with you?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Oh! Oh, good! The strong ones fight together this time!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Rexxar00=Oh! The "beastmaster!" I dare you to try to master me! <laughs>
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Tassadar00=Oh, I like the sound of that!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Hmm, what shall we fight for today? You, uh, green one. What do you think?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroRespond00=I have wanted nothing more in ages!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroRespond01=<laugh> Why, of course!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroRespond02=Don't you worry about Monkey! <laugh>
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Angry00=Stop wagging your tongue if you have nothing to say!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Chen00=I don't care about those things... But I will fight!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Demon00=Show the Handsome Monkey King more respect, ugly demon! <laugh>
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Hmm, so you are dull-witted AND weak. Good to know!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Guldan00=Ah, you recognize old Monkey, yes? Hmm? And so you should!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Horde00=The horde? Hmm... sounds like trouble to me!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=Is that food? If so, yes, yes!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Medivh00=Fate... pah! 
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Monk00=Foolish monk... have you met these gods of yours? They're not so great, trust me!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Murky00=<upset exertion> Unruly fish! I should pound you flat for that!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Negative00=I don't listen to imbeciles!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Positive00=Hah, this should be good fight!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Rexxar00=Ah, hello fellow wanderer! The journey unites us once again!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Sad00=You make me sad! And that makes me angry!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Surprised00=You're here... This Nexus is an interesting place to wander.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Tassadar00=Where there's a good fight, monkey will be there!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Ah, you show your elder the proper respect! <laugh> I like this one!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Kill00=<sigh> Disappointing.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Kill01=A good fight! Who's next?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Kill02=Come back, and I'll beat you again! <laugh>
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Kill03=We both know you're not dead!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Kill04=Pah! Another weakling!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/KillDemon00=Silly demon. You have a lot to learn if you think you can face the Great Sage!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/KillGuldan00=For a WAR-lock you're terrible at fighting.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/KillHorde00=Oof. Did you look like that before I hit you?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/KillHuman00=Hmm, you need to train harder! Much harder!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/KillMedivh00=<laugh> Got you, old crow!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/KillRexxar00=Good fight, my friend! Oh, that was to the bear, by the way! <laugh>
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/KillSamuro00=It seems MY clones won that bout!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/KillSpreeEnd00=Another killing spree ended by my cudgel!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/KillThrall00=You think you control the elements? Ha!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/KillWarrior00=A good fight, warrior! I had a wonderful time!

VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/LowMana00=I am low on mana.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/LowMana01=So tired... I need mana.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/LowMana02=No! I need mana for that.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/MatchEnd00=Hmm. Of course, of course!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/MatchEnd01=Oh, you honor me!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/MatchEnd02=You are quite welcome!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/No00=No!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/No01=I cannot.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/No02=Impossible!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally is in trouble.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_AssistMe00=Help me!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_AssistMe01=To me, quickly!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_AttackCastle00=Attack the core!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_AttackMerc00=I think it's about time we took a mercenary camp.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_AttackOutpost00=We should attack this fort.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_AttackTower00=We should capture the watch tower.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend our core!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Hmm, we should defend this fort.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_DefendTower00=Don't let the enemy take this watch tower.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ping_KillHero00=Take down that hero already!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed00=Yes, master?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed01=Oh! Do you wish to speak to Monkey?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed02=Wha--what's going on? Why are you poking me? Ohh! Is this a lesson? <small laugh> ...I hate those!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed03=My last master tricked me... gave me this golden crown... and then used it to hurt me! He always told me not to do or say things!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed04=Uhm... by the way, he didn't teach you any... "magical chants"... did he? <nervous laugh> Why of course not!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed05=I have had many names, but I prefer <clears throat> "the Handsome Monkey King" above all. It should be obvious why, master... <laugh>
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed06=What? You don't know the Monkey King? Were you trapped under a rock? Hmm? ...Because I was!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed07=I know 72 different transformations! Hm! I bet I can beat our enemy without using a single one! <laugh>
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed08=Life isn't about the destination. It's about the journey... Unless reaching the destination grants you your freedom. THEN it is about the destination.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed09=Oh! Masters love to nag. The world would be better off without them, hmmph! Oh, of course, I don't mean you, master... You're different! ...Mmm.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed10=Uh... Old monkey has gotten himself between a rock and a hard place. Again... <laugh>
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed11=Riding a horse is beneath me... In a single somersault I could leap across this entire battlefield! Why shouldn't I? 
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed12=Game balance? What is that? It sounds stupid!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed13=For every clone I create, I must pluck a hair from my head. With the way you fight, monkey will be bald in a month!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Pissed14=Oh! Sorry, master! Sorry! Monkey will stay quiet! Until you want to speak to me again that is!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Resurrected00=I'm alive? I mean, of course I am!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Resurrected01=Thank you, honored healer!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Revive00=The wait is over. I have returned!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Revive01=How dare you kill an immortal! That makes no sense!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Revive02=Wasn't my name wiped from the book of life and death, hm?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Spec00=Oh, I can get stronger? What a surprise!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Spec01=Why, yes. Exactly as I deserve!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Spec02=<laugh> Of course!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Spec03=A useful gift!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Spec04=I overflow with talent!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Taunt00=Come on, attack me! Try it!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Taunt01=Coward! Step forward and fight me!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Taunt02=You think you can equal the Monkey King?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/TeamKilled00=That wasn't my fault! Surely someone else's, hm?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/TeamKilled02=Hah, impossible.
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/UI_ExLocked00=Master, I am here!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/UI_ExPurchased00=Oh, hello master!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/UI_Gift00=Ah, a new master!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/UI_Lockin00=Another battle!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/UI_Purchase00=I will join you on your journey!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/UI_Trial00=A trial? Oh, very well. Let's get this over with.

VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/UI_WaitLocked01=Get me out of here and we could be fighting things right now!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/UI_WaitPurchased00=Uh, how did I get into this Nexus place anyway? Does anyone know?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/UI_WaitPurchased01=What are you doing, master? Is this some form of meditation?
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ultimate1Used00=Ha ha! Cudgel storm!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ultimate1Used01=I am unmatched!
VoiceOver/SamuroMonkeyking/Ultimate1Used02=Stop me! I dare you!
