VoiceOver/AlarakA/CastleAttackAlly01=Are you allowing them to assail your core?

VoiceOver/AlarakA/CastleAttackAlly03=Defend your core! I shouldn't need to tell you this!
VoiceOver/AlarakA/CastleAttackAlly04=Your core is under attack. (angry)Again.

VoiceOver/AlarakA/DoubleKill00=(sigh) Double kill.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/DoubleKill01=A double kill? <scoff>
VoiceOver/AlarakA/DoubleKill02=Mm, it's a start.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/EndingLose00=Defeat.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/EndingLose01=Is your blood boiling? <chuckle> Good.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/EndingLose02=<sigh> How familiar.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/EndingLose03=You have considerably more to learn.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/EndingLose04=Ah, what you're best at.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/EndingWin00=Victory. More or less.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/EndingWin01=I would not get used to that if I were you.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/EndingWin02=Surprising.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/EndingWin03=Thank your Highlord for this gift, supplicant.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/EndingWin04=I am uncertain you deserved that.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/Ending_Blue00=Blue team is victorious.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/Ending_Red00=Red team is victorious.

VoiceOver/AlarakA/GameStart04=<sigh> Let your failure begin.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/Gravestomp00=Enemy banished. <chuckle>
VoiceOver/AlarakA/Gravestomp_Observer00=Hero banished.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroKill00=Worthy of neither mercy nor interest.

VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroKill03=Again! But slowly. And painfully.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroKill04=Enemy slain.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroKill05=Oh, an inadequate sacrifice.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroKill06=What glorious death.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroKill07=Ha! You survived. Will wonders never cease?
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroKill08=Bah, a clumsy display.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroKill09=No, no. Kill with conviction.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroKill10=Ugh. Sloppier and sloppier.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSelect00=Combat begins shortly. Your failure will likely follow.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSelect01=Conquer or die. Which shall be up to you.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSelectPlayer00=An imposter? Ji'nara, dispose of this charlatan!
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSelectPlayer01=You have caught my interest. I will be judging your actions... harshly.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSelectPlayer02=Hmm, it appears you are a true follower of the Highlord. Carry on.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSelect_Observer00=Oh? Spectating, are we? How voyeuristic.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSelect_Observer01=A battle to the death? For my entertainment? Oh, very well.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSlain00=Oh, you have died.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSlain01=At least your failure was spectacular.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSlain02=Remember who did this to you. And make them suffer for it.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSlain03=I doubt you'll learn from this.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSlain04=Weak links must be culled from the chain.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSlain05=Unacceptable.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSlain06=That will not do at all.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSlain07=Are you dead again? Oh. <mocking laugh>
VoiceOver/AlarakA/HeroSlain08=The idea is to be better than your enemy, you know.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepDestroy00=Keep destroyed.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepDestroy01=These are their defenses? <chuckle>
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepDestroy02=Nothing but smoldering ash.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepDestroy03=Bring down their keeps. Finish them already!
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepDestroy04=I would have delivered the killing blow by now.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepDestroy_Blue00=Blue team has destroyed a keep.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepDestroy_Red00=Red team has destroyed a keep.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepLost00=One of your keeps is now a pile of rubble.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepLost01=Your keep has been taken. Oh, the irony.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepLost02=Keep lost. This reflects poorly upon you.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepLost03=Which of you let the enemy destroy a keep?
VoiceOver/AlarakA/KeepLost04=Just how many keeps will they take from you, I wonder?
VoiceOver/AlarakA/Kill_Observer00=Hero slain.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/Kill_Observer01=Hero slain.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/Kill_Observer02=Hm, hero slain.

VoiceOver/AlarakA/MegaKill00=Mega-kill.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/MegaKill01=Finally, a mega-kill.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/MegaKill02=A Mega-kill... unexpected.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostDestroy00=Fort annihilated.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostDestroy01=Yes, yes... a minor victory.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostDestroy02=Fort destroyed... substandardly.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostDestroy03=I expected that much earlier.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostDestroy04=<Laughs>So much for their fortifications.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostDestroy05=I suppose you have SOME worth.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostDestroy_Blue00=Blue team has destroyed a fort.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostDestroy_Red00=Red team has destroyed a fort.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostLost00=You have lost a fort.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostLost01=Your troubles are compounding quickly.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostLost02=Let me reiterate: Protect your forts.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostLost03=Precisely what do you think you are doing?
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostLost04=Ugh. Your defenses weaken further.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostLost05=You have failed to protect your fort.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostLost06=A fort has been lost. How dreadfully shameful.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostLost07=You needed that fort, you know.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostLost08=Another fort lost.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/OutpostLost09=Failure upon failure.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/PlayerAbandon00=Pathetic coward!
VoiceOver/AlarakA/PlayerAbandon01=Better to die than live in fear.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/PlayerAbandon02=Yes, run away.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/PlayerRejoin00=Once a coward ever a coward.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/PlayerRejoin01=Oh. I had hoped to be rid of them.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/PlayerRejoin02=Returning traitors receive no welcome here.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/Revive00=Ally revived.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/Revive_Observer00=Hero revived.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/SpreeEnd00=Oh, and now your killing spree is over.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/SpreeEnd01=Killing spree squandered.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/SpreeEnd02=Hah! And you've lost another killing spree, I see.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/SpreeEnd_Ally00=Oh my! Your ally's killing spree is over.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/SpreeFirstUpgrade00=Mayhem.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/SpreeMax00=Hero of the Storm.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/SpreeSecondUpgrade00=Rampage.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/SpreeStart00=Killing spree.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/SpreeStart01=Killing spree.

VoiceOver/AlarakA/SpreeThirdUpgrade00=Untouchable.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TalentUnlock00=Choose a talent.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TalentUnlock01=Choose a talent.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TalentUnlock02=Choose a talent.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TalentUnlock03=Must I really remind you to choose a talent?
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TalentUnlock04=Perhaps the correct talent this time?
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TeamKill00=Enemy team dominated.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TeamKill_Blue00=Blue team dominated.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TeamKill_Red00=Red team dominated.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TripleKill00=Triple kill.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TripleKill01=Mm. A triple kill.
VoiceOver/AlarakA/TripleKill02=You call that a triple kill?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Attack00=Strike! Their complacency will be their undoing!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Attack01=What are you waiting for? Slaughter them!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Attack02=The enemy has faltered. Exploit their weaknesses!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Caution00=Pay attention!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_GoodJob00=Huh. So you do have your uses.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_GoodJob01=Their failure is complete.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_GoodJob02=I have brought you glory. Revel in it.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_GoodJob03=Hmm. You are not as weak as you appear.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Heal00=Do not be so foolhardy. Heal yourself while you still can.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Heal01=Heal yourself now. I will not suffer for your failure.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_MercCapture00=By right of combat, these mercenaries will serve me well!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_OnMyWay00=<laugh> So you require my aid. How expected.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_OnMyWay01=Yes. Yes, yes, yes. I shall win your battle shortly.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Retreat00=More pressing affairs deserve my attention.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Retreat01=I must leave, and I blame this failure upon you.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Uhoh00=Ugh! You are such a dissapointment...
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Uhoh01=It seems our enemy is more cunning... than you.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/AI_Uhoh02=Well, perhaps this time you will learn.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack00=Oblivion awaits.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack01=Oh, they shall suffer.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack02=My blade seeks blood.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack03=Krisol thok aran. (Translation: My blades seek blood.)
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack04=Oh, the weak always fall.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack05=Vengeance is mine.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack06=None shall usurp me!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack_Evo00=Oblivion awaits.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack_Evo01=Suffer.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack_Evo02=Blades... seek... blood.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack_Evo03=Weak... crumble.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Attack_Evo04=Vengeance...
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/CantMove00=I can't move.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Celebrate00=Go and tell the others of the victory I have won here.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Celebrate01=An expected outcome.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Comeback00=Their advantage wanes. Prove your worth to me!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Death00=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Death01=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Death02=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Death03=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Death04=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Death05=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Death06=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Death07=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Death08=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Death09=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Healed00=Is this the best healing you can do?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Healed01=Ugh. I've known much better healers.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Healed02=<sigh> You've served your highlord well enough.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Healed_Evo00=Close... enough.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Healed_Evo01=Continue... trying.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroAgree00=Let us say that, for now, we have struck a bargain.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroAgree01=Very well. Submit to my authority and you may join me.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroAgree02=Those who oppose me will fail. I care so little for your desires.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroBoast00=Show our foes no mercy, and expect none in return.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroBoast01=<chuckle> Oh, the enemy will crumble before my might.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion00=Conflict arises. Make your preparations.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion01=Are you ready? Or must we waste more time?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Abathur00=Hmm... The evolution master. You may be of some use to me.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Admiration00=Hmm, you may prove useful. Let us find out.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Alexstrasza00=Curious, your form is an illusion. What exactly are you?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Annoyed00=Oh, it is you.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Artanis00=Ah, here you are, Artanis. Lost in the uncaring depths of space.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_DVa00=<Do not record. Uses IntroQuestion01>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Deckard00=Make no mistake... I intend neither to stay, nor listen.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Oh, your power could prove useful.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Disgust00=Ugh, this is my ally? The very thought is repugnant.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Fenix00=Ugh. A previously slain ally does not inspire confidence, dragoon.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Guldan00=Your unquenchable desire for power reminds me of a certain god... He's a pile of ashes now.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=Oh, the Queen of Blades. I trust you will live up to your reputation.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Malganis00=I am a master manipulator, demon. Save your tricks for the enemy.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=You are different from the other beings of light. How very interesting.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Mephisto00=Oh! The Lord of Hatred... I've heard much about you demon.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Mocking00=Surely you do not consider yourself my equal? <laugh>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=You? Oh, surely this is a jest?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Oh, you... how unfortunate.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Hmm. You might be of use to me. Good.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Probius00=Ah, a probe. Good. I am in need of servant. Follow.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Protoss00=A templar? I see... Perhaps you can talk our enemy to death?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Regal00=How will you serve me?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Samuro00=Another honorable warrior. How exhausting.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_SamuroMonkey00=Another of these filthy primates. How many terrans must I tolerate?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Stukov00=Terran and zerg in one twisted little package. How repulsive.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Oh, I sense within you a fire others lack. Let's hope this proves interesting.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Tassadar00=So, you're the one the Templar worship... <scoff> (Laughing)This explains a great deal.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Terran00=The terrans? Oh, were there no viable allies?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Tracer00=You? A primate? Capable of chrono-manipulation? <mocking laugh> Impossible.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Zagara00=Huh, I see. Kerrigan's lackey.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Well, if isn't the mighty zerg. Whose slaves are you this week, I wonder?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroRespond00=<scoff> You are unworthy of my conversation.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroRespond01=Spare me your concern.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroRespond02=<sigh> Yes.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Abathur00=Ah, indeed.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Admiration00=<laugh> I believe I like you. How unexpected.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Agree00=Very well, I agree. For now.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Alexstrasza00=This and MANY others.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=Ugh, your visage pains my eyes.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=<angry exertion> You have ensured your demise.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Artanis00=Oh, please. Drop the false incredulity. I know you are not THAT naive.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Bizarre00=Curious. How has your kind avoided natural selection for this long?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Bored00=Irritating your Highlord is bold, but unwise.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Chogall00=Indeed. If only I felt the same.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_DVa00=<Do not record. Uses No01>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=<scoff> The battlefield is no place for a scholar.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Defer00=Your anger would be better focused upon our enemy.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Power and malevolence incarnate. 'Tis a pity you're so single-minded.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Disagree00=No, I will not bind my fate to yours.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=<scoff> You cannot hide weakness behind strong words.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Fenix00=It's hard to believe, but I'm starting to prefer that Talandar machine.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Firebat00=There are no protoss like me.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Guldan00=Oh? Enjoy being crushed by it.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Illidan00=And how do you plan on doing that, precisely?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Oh, no... It SHALL be.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Lucio00=I could "release you" if you so desire. <dark laugh>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Malganis00=And yet, I, have the superior means of execution.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=I beg to differ.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto00=Let us say for now, we have struck a bargain.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Was that an attempt at wit? Oh, it's so difficult to parse the thoughts of lesser beings.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ha, I believe I like you, fish creature. Come, we shall claim our vengeance together!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=You waste both my time and your breath. And the former has value.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Come, victory awaits us.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Probius00=Warfare is in my blood. Two things that are beyond you.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Protoss00=I will not bind my fate to yours. My path is mine alone.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Samuro00=Be careful of how you address your Highlord.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_SamuroMonkey00=Oh? And where might I find these "strong ones" exactly?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Scoff00=<scoff>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Scoff01=<scoff>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Scoff02=<scoff>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Snide00=Be glad you still have some use.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Stukov00=Then consider this your first disappointment.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=<laugh> If only the same could be said for you.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Terran00=Save your words, primate. Spare me from hearing your orifice flap.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Tracer00=An unwittingly astute observation.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Valeera00=Indeed I shall. The question is, will you?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Zagara00=Yes.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/IntroResponse_Zerg00=If I desired to hear to inane chattering, I would have stayed with Artanis.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Kill00=<scoff> Your name shall be stricken from memory.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Kill01=By the rite of Rak'shir, I am highlord!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Kill02=Is there no one who can pose a challenge?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Kill03=(sigh) How terribly unsatisfying.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Kill04=A waste of time and energy.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillArtanis00=(laughing)Artanis. I expected so much more.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillDraenei00=Spacefaring goats? Absurd.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillFenix00=A templar actually worth fighting! Hah!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillFenix01=Another death, templar? How many is that?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillFirebat00=Burnt out quickly, did we?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillInteresting00=Hmm, that was almost interesting.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillKerrigan00=Queen, meet MY blades.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillLesser00=Unworthy of my attention.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillMaiev00=I'd stick to watching, if I were you.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillMalganis00=Return to the void... the nether. Or whatever you call it.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillMurky00=You have an impressive determination.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillPrimal00=Primal zerg. What a useless distinction.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillProtoss00=Glory to the victor!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Are you truly the best this realm could offer?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillStukov00=Your misery is at its end.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillTassadar00=Tassadar, Savior of the Templar. <scoff>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillTerran00=Do you see what your hubris has wrought, terran?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillZagara00=Oh... A disappointing start to your reign, Zagara.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillZeratul00=It seems I overestimated your skill, Dark Prelate.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/KillZerg00=Behold, the mighty zerg. Dead at my feet.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Laugh01=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Laugh02=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Laugh03=<aggressive laugh, after killing an enemy.>

VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Laugh16=<aggressive laugh, after killing an enemy.>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/LowLifeHeal00=Cutting it close, aren't we?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/LowLifeHeal01=The tides turn in my favor.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/LowLifeHeal02=Please... Was there any doubt?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/LowMana00=My mana is low.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/LowMana01=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/LowMana02=Ugh. No, I need more mana.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/LowMana_Evo00=Low mana.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/MatchEnd00=<Do not record. Reuses other VO>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/MatchEnd01=<Do not record. Reuses other VO>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/MatchEnd02=<Do not record. Reuses other VO>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/No01=(laughing)You had best be joking.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/No02=Even you cannot be that ignorant.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/No03=Do not presume to order me!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally falters. That is not acceptable.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I cannot hold forever. How long will you delay?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Come, supplicants. Lend me your strength.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Attack00=Why are we not attacking here?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Take down their core and end this!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Bind these mercenaries into our service.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=This fort must be destroyed.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Claiming this tower would give us an advantage.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Capture00=Make yourself useful and capture this.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Capture01=Secure the objective or suffer.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Collect00=Gather these. Now.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Collect01=Claim these or our foes will.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Danger00=If you wish to die, go here.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Danger01=That fight is lost. Focus your efforts elsewhere.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Defend00=Defend here. Slaughter anyone who approaches.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend the core, immediately!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=I expect you to defend our forts. Do not fail me.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DefendStructure00=This structure is more valuable to me than you are.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DefendStructure01=Defend this structure, with your life if necessary.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DefendThing00=Protect our ally. Or must I do everything myself?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DefendThing01=Why must you specialize in failure? Defend our ally!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Take the watch tower, and blind our enemy!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Must I level this structure myself?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Raze this structure and their hopes with it.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=Eliminate their ally, and watch them scurry.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=Must I remind you to kill their ally?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=The enemy has fled in fear of me. Oh... How expected.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_EnemyMissing01=The enemy has gone missing. Do not fall for their ruse.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_KillHero00=You can see this hero, yes? Then kill them!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=I am on my way. Do try to survive until then.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=You will be honored by my presence soon.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Retreat00=Run. That's what you're good at anyway!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Retreat01=I order a retreat. Defy me and die.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Transport00=I will keep it simple. Move this. Now.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_Transport01=Ugh, this should have been moved already.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Head for the turn in point. Immediately.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Deliver the paltry sum you have collected.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed00=You address the highlord?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed01=How shall you serve me?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed02=Have you come seeking wisdom? You certainly need it.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed03=Or is this a challenge? Ha, of course not. Your kind lacks the fortitude for such a thing.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed04=I'd show more care when poking my armor if I were you. A little prick can be quite the annoyance.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed05=The Nexus. A conflux of time and space, where heroes and worlds clash. Sounds like underwhelming science fiction. I mean, really, are you even trying anymore?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed06=In ancient times the first highlord was asked, "Where shall be our homeworld?" He pointed downward, saying, "Wherever I tread." Even now, this edict is unchanged.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed07=Why honor those who die in battle? When the glory belongs to those who kill.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed08=The difference between the Templar and the Tal'darim is simple. Templar use long-winded speeches to reach the hearts of their warriors. <beat> We use a blade.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed09=The chain of ascension wasn't the first thing we tried. I'll admit the carousel of omnipotence was fun, but the idea never really went anywhere.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed10=Free to play is a delusion granted to the weak by the strong. Or... so I've heard.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed11=Is this all you do? Imagine how much better you could be if you channeled your efforts into actually fighting.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed12=The more you prod, the worse your punishment shall be...
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed13=We Tal'darim name our worlds to honor significant events. We called our homeworld Slayn. Let your imagination run wild as to why.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed14=I have grown tired of these realm lords and their insipid demands... <scoff> What is a realm lord compared to a HIGHlord?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed15=No, no more of this. I am a conqueror, not an entertainer.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed_Evo00=Address... highlord.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Pissed_Evo01=Serve... me.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKill00=(laughing)You're not good at this, are you?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKill01=Oh, dear. Your skills are fading fast.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKill02=Perhaps you need a rest?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKill03=You are utterly pathetic.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKill04=Oh, dear. A pitiful display.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKillMulti00=(laughing)Oh, it's you. Still failing, I see?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKillMulti01=Well, at least your ineptitude is consistent.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKillMulti02=Stop crawling back, insect.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKillMulti03=I am growing (yawn)very tired of killing you.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKillMulti04=Oh, what sport is there in THIS?
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/RepeatKillMulti05=<scoff> A youngling would pose a greater challenge!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Resurrected00=My return heralds their end.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Resurrected01=Yes. You made the correct choice.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Revive00=<unhappy exertion> That was rather disagreeable. Do not fail me again.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Revive01=Your highlord has returned.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Revive02=My vengeance will be denied no longer.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_Dance00=If you are going to do something, excel at it.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_Dance01=You have no idea how hard it is to avoid these spikes.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_Goodbye00=This exchange has become tiresome. You may leave now.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_Goodbye01=Oh, am I unclear? I'm done with you.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_Hello00=You may speak.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_Hello01=Address your highlord with due respect.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_Sorry00=Hmm. Let that be a lesson to you.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_Sorry01=Do not disappoint me again.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_Thanks00=Yes, you've completed your task. Good lapdog. <mimics panting>
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_Thanks01=If you desire adulation, seek it elsewhere.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_WellPlayed00=Perhaps I've underestimated you. (deciding against it)No... no actually I haven't.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Hmm, clever. I will be watching you more closely.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Spec00=Oh? I didn't realize I could grow more powerful.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Spec01=Hmph. Yes, I like it.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Spec02=Oh! This shall be the instrument of my wrath.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Spec03=<judgmental exertion> Acceptable.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Spec04=A curious choice. But not an unwelcome one.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Taunt00=You shall know my wrath, firsthand.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Taunt01=Step forth and face Alarak, Highlord of the Tal'darim!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Taunt02=Run away, or die. I care little which you choose.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Taunt_Evo00=Know wrath.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Taunt_Evo01=Step forth.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Taunt_Evo02=Flee. Now.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/TeamKilled00=Ugh... You are all unworthy of my leadership.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_ExLocked00=Oh, dear. I expected so much more.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Oh... it's you.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_Gift00=Oh, please. Charity is self-interest in disguise.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_Lockin00=Finally.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_Purchase00=Ah! You chose wisely.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_Trial00=A trial? <laugh> Very well, I accept.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_Trial01=Mmm. It seems there is much to teach you.

VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Inaction is a symptom of weakness.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Is there something you require? Get on with it!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=What are you doing? If you must learn, do it on the battlefield!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=I do see you, you know.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate1Used00=I will handle this.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate1Used01=Meet my blades!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate1Used02=There's no escape.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate1Used03=Ho ho! Your demise is at hand.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=No escape.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo01=Demise... has come.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate2Used00=I defy your strength!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate2Used01=Too easy...
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate2Used02=Allow me a counter proposal.
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate2Used03=Face me!
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate2Used_Evo00=Counter...
VoiceOver/AlarakBase/Ultimate2Used_Evo01=Fatal... error.
