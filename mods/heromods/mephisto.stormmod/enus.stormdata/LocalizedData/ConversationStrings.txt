VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Abathur00=I am eternal, creature. Hatred always survives.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=Hmm. And I sense much potential within you, mortal. Perhaps you and I have much to discuss.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Alexstrasza00=Tell me more of what you loathe. <dark laugh>
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=I will drag your corpse across the jagged wastes of eternity.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_ArchangelDiablo00=No... this... this is not possible.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Auriel00=A truce then? And who shall you grant to me this time, Auriel?
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=All worlds will fall before the burning standards of hell. I have seen it.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=How abhorrent.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=You Zakarum are so very impressionable after all.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_D2Hero00=Your threats wear as thin as the aging mouth that utters them.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Then we are in agreement.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Dehaka00=Submit to my rule, creature, and I will slake your greed with the essence of realms beyond your comprehension.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Where I am IS Hell.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_DemonicAuriel00=<chuckle> So it shall be.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_DemonicImperius00=This... Nexus... has quite the sense of humor.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_DemonicTyrael00=Friend? What trickery is this?
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=March forth, Diablo and spread your terror into the Nexus.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_DiabloPrime00=Strange, it feels as if I already have somehow...
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Silence!
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Evil00=This false reality will burn away and hell shall rise in its place.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Evil01=Let our enemies tremble before our power.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Evil02=My final victory awaits. Forward!
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=A tolerable pact. Let it be bound before the eyes of all.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Good00=Another ally preoccupied with mindless righteousness...
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Good01=How I abhor the righteous.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Good02=I have ill need of your words...

VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=Death. A never wholly welcome guest.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Of course, I will. Humanity's suffering is my delight, young creature.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=The misery of companions is a comfort to the wretched.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Nephalem00=Do not make me regret allowing your existence... Nephalem.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_No00=I despise the very notion.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Orc00=You fate is bound to demonkind... whether you wish it or not.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Orphea00=You have a force of will beyond your years. I accept these terms... for now.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=All that exists will perish within the poisonous void of my hatred.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Protoss00=Altruism. How irritating. Still your corpse could prove useful.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Hell hath no limitations... your inflexibility is why you fail, angel.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=<chuckle> All the better.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Kill00=Enjoy the gift of my pitiless ire.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Kill01=I despise you.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Kill02=And lo, the seed of hatred takes root.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Kill03=Oblivion is a mercy. I am not merciful
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Kill04=The ravenous shadows wail.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillAuriel00=<sighing exhale>
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillButcher00=Down, mongrel.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillD2Hero00=Nothing of value. I'll have to kill you again. And again. And AGAIN.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillD3Demon00=Out of my way, weakling.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillDeckard00=The last Horadrim... good riddance.

VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillIllidan00=Feel the hatred of infinite years!
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillImperius00=You were once so feared, Imperius. <laugh>
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillLesser00=The Prime Evils reign supreme.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillMalthael00=It is a strange place where even death may die.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillMephisto00=That trick will not work on me, Belial.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillMephisto01=A mere shade of my glory.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillNephalem00=How I despise my daughter's misbegotten spawn...
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillSpreeEnd00=The strongest mortal is no more threatening than the strongest ant.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillTyrael00=The truce does not protect you here.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/KillValla00=Your discipline is a droplet in the sea of my hatred.

VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Pissed01=Word your requests carefully.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Pissed02=Why must you click me, mortal!? I have a lot of unresolved issues about left-clicking.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Pissed03=Of course my brother Diablo manifested within the Nexus first. He is always the harbinger of the Prime Evil's wrath.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Pissed04=What's my biggest weakness? Hmm. Well, if anything I'd say I'm TOO passionate. I really get into my work.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Pissed05=Even in the depths of the burning hells there is an edict that is unquestionable: haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate.

VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Pissed08=Tell me, is there hatred in your soul? Would you like there to be?
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Pissed09=I don't "throw shade." My shade stays precisely where I tell it to. If anything I throw myself.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Pissed10=Hard to believe this form was once human isn't it? I think I'm missing a finger on each hand... Oh, and legs.
VoiceOver/MephistoBase/Pissed11=I tell everyone who dates my daughter the same thing. "While my daughter and I may not see eye to eye... if you hurt her, I WILL impale you with barbed hooks for all of eternity." So, it's Inarius's fault really.
