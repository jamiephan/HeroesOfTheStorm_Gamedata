Conversation/CreepVO/Line00238=Strzelaj, albo wystrzelę w nich twoim łbem!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00239=Oto łup godny pirata.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00242=Kto pierwszy przyniesie mi łup? Ha, ha, ha, ha…

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00248=Słuchać mnie, jest jeden kapitan i uznaje tylko jedno… Złoto!

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00250=Kradnąc…
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00251=Mordując... Nieważne.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00252=Podejdź do mojego okrętu i daj mi dublony! A ja walnę salwą z całej burty w twojego wroga!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00254=Wiedzcie, że ta kraina jest pod moją pieczą. Mam tutaj niepodzielną władzę.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00255=Jeśli zależy wam na zwycięstwie, zbierzecie daninę na moją cześć.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00256=Kto pierwszy otrzyma moje błogosławieństwo?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00257=Wasi wrogowie sczezną... Wszystkie ich budynki zostaną osłabione.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00258=Lepiej wykorzystajcie przewagę. Moja przychylność nie trwa wiecznie. Hahaha!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00259=Co wy na to? Gotowi zacząć?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00260=Przybyliście do Przeklętej Kotliny? Hahaha! Zabawne.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00261=Bohaterowie! Kopalnie wkrótce otworzą swe podwoje... a nieumarli ożyją.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00262=W tych kopalniach czai się śmierć... Czy starczy wam odwagi, żeby stawić czoło ciemności?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00263=Jesteście gotowi do walki z nieumarłymi? Kopalnie wkrótce staną przed wami otworem.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00264=Bohaterowie! Zmarli wstają z grobów. Czy ośmielicie się wkroczyć do kopalń?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00265=Teraz nie ma już odwrotu...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00266=Wejdźcie. Potępieńcy już na was czekają.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00267=Słyszycie chrzęst kości? Nieumarli chyba zgłodnieli...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00268=Powstańcie, golemy! Ożyjcie i dajcie upust swej wściekłości!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00269=Niechaj moje golemy ożyją ponownie!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00270=Wybiła godzina powrotu moich golemów.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00271=Dobra robota, wasz golem jest potężniejszy od wrogiego.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00272=Wasz golem może już stanąć do walki... Jednak jest słabszy od wrogiego.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00273=Oba golemy wyglądają na równie silne.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00274=Golemy powracają... Twój jest o wiele potężniejszy.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00275=Dobra robota, wasz golem jest o wiele potężniejszy od wrogiego.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00276=Golemy ożywają... Ale strzeż się, twój jest o wiele słabszy od wrogiego.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00277=Jeśli chcesz mieć silniejszego golema, musisz zebrać więcej czaszek.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00278=Golemy ożyły. Oba są równie potężne.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00279=Hmm. Oba golemy są chyba tak samo silne.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00280=Moje golemy wracają... Będzie zabawnie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00281=Wyzwól swój bezkresny gniew!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00282=Moment, zaraz zrobi się śmiertelnie groźnie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00283=Hahahahahaha!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00284=Pięknie. Za chwilę rozpocznie się główna atrakcja.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00285=Zapowiada się doprawdy upiornie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00286=Nieszczęśnicy! Witajcie... w Nawiedzonych Kopalniach, gdzie panują wieczne rządy śmierci...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00287=Kopalnie wkrótce będą otwarte... a mieszkające w nich potwory przebudzą się.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00288=Hahaha! Może udałoby nam się dojść do obopólnie korzystnego porozumienia.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00289=Zgładźcie nieumarłych i zabierzcie ich czaszki.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00290=W zamian przywołam moje potężne kościane golemy.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00291=Zniszczą obronę twojego wroga. To jak... umowa stoi?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00292=Prastare kapliczki niedługo się otworzą. Przejmijcie nad nimi kontrolę i uwolnijcie Smoczego Rycerza!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00293=Kapliczki gromadzą moc. Smoczy Rycerz nawołuje ze swego kamiennego więzienia.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00294=Bohaterowie, kapliczki niedługo się otworzą...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00295=W kapliczkach gromadzi się moc. Wyzwólcie gniew smoka!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00296=Szybko, aktywujcie kapliczki i zdobądźcie moc Smoka.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00297=Smok budzi się ze swej drzemki... Uwolnijcie jego potęgę!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00298=Aktywujcie kapliczki. Przejmijcie moc Smoczego Rycerza!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00299=Uwolnijcie Smoczego Rycerza i urządźcie wrogom krwawą łaźnię!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00300=Już czas! Uwolnijcie Smoczego Rycerza!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00301=Bohaterowie! Moc Smoka należy do was!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00302=Zniszczcie swoich wrogów!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00303=Bohaterowie... Wróg kontroluje kapliczki.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00304=Teraz spadnie na was gniew Smoka!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00305=Bohaterowie, wasz czas się kończy.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00306=Niech twoi wrogowie spłoną!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00307=Z twoich wrogów zostanie popiół!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00308=Znowu żyję!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00309=Będziesz płonąć.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00310=Płomienie oczyszczą wszystko.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00311=Zamienię cię w popiół!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00312=Nie wrócę do tego więzienia! Nie!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00313=Nie... Jeszcze nie skończyłem!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00314=Znów będą rządzić smoki!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00315=Smoki zapanują nad tą krainą!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00316=Oto Ogrody Smoczych Włości... Niesamowite, nieprawdaż? A przecież zbudowano je na kłamstwie...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00317=Ludzie zapomnieli już, kim byłam. Tą krainą rządziły niegdyś Smoki.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00318=Aktywujcie Kapliczki Słońca i Księżyca, aby osłabić magię, która więzi Smoczego Rycerza.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00319=Użyczę wam jego mocy. Spalcie swoich wrogów. Zburzcie mury ich zamków. Przypomnijcie światu potęgę prastarych istot.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00320=Smok wkrótce się odrodzi. Zapanuj nad jego mocą albo stań się jej ofiarą... Wybór należy do ciebie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00321=Wasz golem jest słabszy od wrogiego. Przygotuj się do obrony.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00322=Wasze golemy są równie silne. Przygotujcie się.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00323=Przywoływanie zakończone. Wasz golem jest silniejszy od wrogiego.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00324=Wasz golem jest potężniejszy od wrogiego. Wykorzystaj to.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00325=Słaby golem. Zbierzcie więcej czaszek, bohaterowie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00326=Gotowe. Wasz golem jest równie silny, co golem przeciwnika.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00327=Uwolnij się i zniszcz swoich wrogów!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00328=Bohaterowie! Pokonajcie nieumarłych i zabierzcie im czaszki.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00329=Zbierajcie czaszki i wzmocnijcie swojego golema!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00330=Bohaterowie! Potępieńcy wkrótce powrócą. Przygotujcie się.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00331=Bohaterowie... Wkrótce w kopalniach ożyją nieumarli.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00332=Powstańcie raz jeszcze, golemy moje, i wyzwólcie swój bezkresny gniew!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00333=Ponownie otwierają się kapliczki. Kto przejmie moc Smoczego Rycerza?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00334=Smok czeka na bohaterów! Uwolnijcie go i zniszczcie swego wroga.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00335=Nadszedł czas! Uwolnijcie moc Smoka!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00336=Koniec jest blisko, a twój wróg wkrótce przebudzi Smoka.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00337=Twojego wroga czeka zagłada!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00338=Pochłonie cię ogień!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00339=Czas... ucieka...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00340=Bohaterowie, za parę chwil zapadnie noc... Obyście byli gotowi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00341=Zapada zmrok, bohaterowie. Patrzcie, jak pięknie mój ogród wygląda w blasku księżyca.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00342=Oto znów zapada zmrok. Wkrótce ponownie ożyją moje truchła.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00343=Bohaterowie, nadchodzi noc. Pamiętajcie, musicie zabijać truchła i odbierać im nasiona.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00344=Noc zapadnie za 30 sekund. Jesteście gotowi na odrobinę atrakcji?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00345=Truchła powstają! Zgładźcie je... Odbierzcie im nasiona.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00346=Truchła powstają... Zgładźcie je i zbierzcie nasiona.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00347=Już czas... Zróbcie, co do was należy.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00348=Truchła powstają raz jeszcze. Bohaterowie, uwolnijcie moje nasiona.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00349=Wyrżnijcie ich w pień! Odbierzcie moje nasiona!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00350=Zaraz będzie świtać... Pośpieszcie się.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00351=Nadchodzi świt... Nasz czas prawie się skończył.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00352=Widać jutrznię. Nadchodzi dzień.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00353=Grrrr! Przeklęte słońce... Szybko, odbierzcie im moje nasiona...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00358=Macie dość nasion. Przynieście mi je... a wzmocnię wasze wątłe ciała...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00359=Nareszcie macie wystarczająco dużo nasion. Chodźcie... stańcie się dumą mego ogrodu.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00360=Przynieście nasiona na moją ziemię... i napawajcie się przerażeniem swoich wrogów.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00361=Bohaterowie, zasadźcie nasiona.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00362=Chodźcie tu i zasadźcie nasiona.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00363=Nie igrajcie ze mną. Zasadźcie nasiona... wykorzystajcie moją moc.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00364=Przyjdźcie na moją ziemię... i zasadźcie nasiona.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00365=Zasadźcie nasiona, istoty z krwi i kości.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00366=Wasz koszmar ożył! Naprzód! Niechaj pożywi się zwłokami waszych wrogów!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00367=Świetnie! Ruszajcie naprzód i rozsadźcie forty wroga!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00368=Powstań, mój koszmarze! Wyssij życie ze swych wrogów!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00369=Wasz wróg ożywił koszmar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00370=Koszmar waszego wroga rozkwitł.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00371=Wasz przeciwnik wyhodował własny koszmar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00372=Wasz koszmar obudził się do życia.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00373=W końcu wasz koszmar ożył!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00374=Wasz koszmar rozkwitł. Oby był potężniejszy od koszmaru wroga.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00375=Wasz wróg ożywił koszmar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00376=Wasz wróg wyhodował sobie własny koszmar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00377=Bohaterowie! Wasz wróg ożywił koszmar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00378=O, nie! Mój cudowny koszmar zginął!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00379=Wasz koszmar zginął. Na powrót staliście się wątłymi śmiertelnikami.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00380=Wasz koszmar, moje maleństwo, nie żyje...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00381=Koszmar waszego wroga trafił na kompost.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00382=Koszmar wroga poległ.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00383=Z koszmaru waszego wroga został tylko martwy pień!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00384=Wasz koszmar zginął, ale wrogi wciąż żyje.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00385=Koszmar wroga żyje.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00386=Teraz musicie radzić sobie sami.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00387=Nikt was nie powstrzyma! Zniszczcie ich!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00388=Tak... Wskażcie drogę mojemu koszmarowi. Zgładźcie wszystkich.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00389=Koszmar wroga poległ. Ruszajcie... zabierzcie ich zwłoki.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00394=Macie już wystarczająco dużo nasion! Zasadźcie je, a kiełki wzmocnią wasze wątłe ciała...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00395=Nareszcie macie wystarczająco dużo nasion. Zasadźcie je tutaj i stańcie się dumą mego ogrodu.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00396=Dobra robota, bohaterowie. A teraz przynieście tu nasiona i upajajcie się strachem swoich wrogów.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00397=Oto zakwitł koszmar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00398=Koszmar obudził się do życia.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00399=Oto zakwitł koszmar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00400=Koszmar obudził się do życia.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00401=<ziewa> Słońce zaczyna wschodzić... Czas na sen, maleństwa moje.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00402=Widzę, że udało się wam przetrwać kolejną noc. Czyż to nie cudownie?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00403=Bohaterowie, nadszedł świt, więc moje maleństwa muszą ułożyć się na spoczynek.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00404=Na razie to już koniec... ale nie spoczywajcie na laurach. Zainfekowani wkrótce powrócą.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00405=O, Bohaterowie! Haha! Przybyliście w samą porę, by ujrzeć, jak mój ogród budzi się do życia.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00406=Nocą zachodzi wielka przemiana... i zakwita Ogród Grozy!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00407=Zabijcie te bezmyślne truchła i odbierzcie im nasiona.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00408=Gdy nazbieracie ich dosyć, otrzymacie moc natury.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00411=Chodźcie i zasadźcie nasiona, by unicestwić swoich wrogów.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00412=Lepiej zasadźcie już nasiona.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00413=No... Na co czekacie? Macie nasiona, więc je zasadźcie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00414=Szybko, zasadźcie nasiona w żyznej glebie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00415=Zasadźcie nasiona... Nawet w środku dnia mogę dać wam nową moc.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00416=Dobrze! Wasz koszmar ożył! Każcie mu zbierać zwłoki swoich wrogów.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00417=Wspaniale! Koszmar rozsadzi korzeniami forty przeciwnika!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00418=Bardzo ładnie. Teraz koszmar wyssie życie z waszych wrogów.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00419=Wasz wróg ożywił koszmar. Ciekawe, co z tego wyniknie…
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00420=Przykro mi to mówić, ale wasz wróg ożywił koszmar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00421=Bohaterowie, wasz przeciwnik wyhodował własny koszmar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00422=Wasz koszmar ożył. Czyż to nie cudowne?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00423=Mam wrażenie, że ten koszmar bardzo wam się teraz przyda.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00424=Pojawił się wasz koszmar. Ciekawe, czy będzie silniejszy od wrogiego...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00425=Bohaterowie, wasz wróg również ożywił koszmar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00426=Oj... Coś mi się widzi, że wasz wróg wyhodował sobie własny koszmar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00427=Bohaterowie, wasz wróg ożywił koszmar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00428=Wasz koszmar sczezł.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00429=Wasz koszmar poszedł na kompost.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00430=Wasz koszmar został unicestwiony.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00431=Wyśmienicie! Koszmar waszego wroga obumarł.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00432=Zniszczyliście koszmar wroga.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00433=Doskonale, z koszmaru waszego wroga został tylko martwy pień!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00434=Bohaterowie, wasz koszmar zginął, ale wrogi wciąż żyje.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00435=Bohaterowie, koszmar wroga wciąż żyje!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00436=Obyście byli w stanie powstrzymać wroga bez mego koszmaru...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00437=Koszmar waszego wroga poległ! Nie ustawajcie w walce, bohaterowie!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00438=Zniszczyliście koszmar wroga! Zaczynam być pod wrażeniem, bohaterowie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00439=Koszmar wroga został unicestwiony! Bohaterowie, kontynuujcie krwawe żniwa!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00440=Czyż noc nie jest piękna... kiedy ktoś rzuci klątwę?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00442=Rozsiewajcie moje maleństwa. Taka jest wola Królowej Zarodników!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00443=Wreszcie macie wystarczająco dużo nasion. Oto ponownie rośnie koszmar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00444=Zebraliście wystarczająco dużo nasion! Wasz koszmar rośnie, że aż miło patrzeć.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00445=Dobra robota, bohaterowie. Wkrótce ogrodowy koszmar będzie pod waszą kontrolą.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00446=Macie wystarczająco dużo nasion. Rośnij, mój koszmarze!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00447=Bohaterowie, koszmar czeka. Chodźcie i przejmijcie jego moc.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00448=Czemu zwlekacie? Koszmar nie będzie trwał wiecznie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00449=Wasz koszmar zaczyna więdnąć. Lepiej się pośpieszcie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00450=Cóż innego wam zostało? Przebudźcie mój koszmar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00452=Bohaterowie, spóźniliście się. Odrzuciliście mój dar... Zgnijcie bez niego.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00453=Chyba nie pozwolicie, żeby mój koszmar zmarniał na winorośli? To by była głupota.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00454=Wasz koszmar zwiądł... Co za marnotrawstwo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00455=Wielka szkoda... Wasz koszmar sczezł. A taki był dorodny...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00457=Bohaterowie, zbierzcie owoce swego trudu. Ożywcie mój koszmar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00459=Wykorzystajcie swój koszmar. To świetna zabawa, możecie mi wierzyć!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00460=Macie już wystarczająco dużo nasion. Oto rośnie koszmar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00461=Nareszcie macie wystarczająco dużo nasion. Czujecie, jak rośnie koszmar?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00462=No, powinno wystarczyć. Wkrótce ogrodowy koszmar będzie wasz.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00463=Wystarczy wam już nasion. Rośnij, mój koszmarze!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00464=Koszmar czeka. Chodźcie, przejmijcie jego moc.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00465=Nie zwlekajcie. Wasz koszmar łaknie gospodarza.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00468=Wasz koszmar zwiądł. Nie pozwólcie, by wasze wysiłki poszły na marne.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00469=Koszmar nie może długo czekać... Przejmijcie jego moc.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00470=Czas zebrać plon. Ożywcie mój koszmar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00472=Dobrze wykorzystajcie swój koszmar. Zgładźcie wrogów!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00473=Wzgardziliście moim darem? Więc zgnijcie bez niego.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00474=Mój koszmar zwiądł? Co za bezmyślność!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00475=Wasz koszmar zwiądł... Co za marnotrawstwo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00476=Jakim prawem pozwoliliście mojemu koszmarowi zwiędnąć i umrzeć...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00477=Moje golemy poległy. Nic to, czaszek ci u nas dostatek.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00478=Golemy zostały pokonane.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00479=Zdaje się, że moje golemy wróciły do ziemi. Ale to jeszcze nie koniec.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00480=Golemy powrócą, mili bohaterowie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00481=I tak oto zginęły kościane golemy. Z prochuś powstał, w proch się obrócisz, jak to mówią!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00482=Klątwa przestaje działać. Przynajmniej do czasu, kiedy ktoś znów zdobędzie moją przychylność.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00483=Klątwa zanika. Może teraz docenicie jej moc.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00484=Bardzo dobrze. Wasi wrogowie zostaną osłabieni. Niech ich trup ściele się przed wami gęsto!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00485=Bohaterowie, spada na was klątwa. Ciekawe, czy ją przetrwacie.

Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00022=Jesteście gotowi do walki z nieumarłymi? Kopalnie wkrótce staną przed wami otworem.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00023=Bohaterowie! Zmarli wstają z grobów. Czy ośmielicie się wkroczyć do kopalń?
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00024=Bohaterowie! Potępieńcy wkrótce powrócą. Przygotujcie się.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00025=Bohaterowie... Wkrótce w kopalniach ożyją nieumarli.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00026=Teraz nie ma już odwrotu...
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00027=Wejdźcie. Potępieńcy już na was czekają.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00028=Słyszycie chrzęst kości? Nieumarli chyba zgłodnieli...
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00029=Bohaterowie! Pokonajcie nieumarłych i zabierzcie im czaszki.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00030=Zbierajcie czaszki i wzmocnijcie swojego golema!
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00031=Powstańcie, golemy! Ożyjcie i dajcie upust swej wściekłości!

Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00036=Dobra robota, wasz golem jest potężniejszy od wrogiego.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00037=Wasz golem może już stanąć do walki... Jednak jest słabszy od wrogiego.

Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00049=Wasze golemy są równie silne. Przygotujcie się.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00050=Gotowe. Wasz golem jest równie silny, co golem przeciwnika.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00037=Ciekawe, jak smakuje twój strach, śmiertelniku?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00038=Skąd mam wiedzieć? Nawet nie wiedziałem, że strach ma smak...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00039=Pożrę cię!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00040=No, nie robi dobrego pierwszego wrażenia, co nie? Już ja nauczę go manier.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00041=Musisz mi wyjaśnić, co się tutaj dzieje.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00042=Kraina ta zwie się Kruczy Dwór... i wygląda na to, że zaatakował ją władca demonów – Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00043=Twoje zdolności są widoczne na pasku akcji, w dolnej części ekranu.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00044=Zanim rzucisz wyzwanie Diablo, naucz się wykorzystywać swoje zdolności.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00045=Najpierw spróbuj wykorzystać Pocisk Penetrujący przeciwko nieumarłym sługom Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00046=Najpierw wypróbuj działanie Pocisku Penetrującego na stronnikach Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00047=Cierpliwości, młodzieńcze. Dokładnie wyceluj i spróbuj ponownie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00048=Naciśnij klawisz „Q”, a następnie wyceluj w szkielety i kliknij lewym przyciskiem myszy, aby wystrzelić.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00051=Prawe kliknięcie anuluje użycie zdolności. Gdy widać celownik, naciśnij lewy przycisk, aby oddać strzał.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00053=Najpierw naciśnij klawisz „Q”, a następnie wyceluj we wrogów. Potem kliknij lewym przyciskiem myszy, aby wystrzelić.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00055=Aktywuj Pocisk Penetrujący, a następnie wyceluj we wrogów. Kiedy będziesz gotów, kliknij, aby wystrzelić.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00056=Po naciśnięciu klawisza „Q” wyceluj w szkielety, a następnie kliknij lewy przycisk myszy, aby wystrzelić.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00058=Kiedy już aktywujesz Pocisk Penetrujący, wyceluj we wrogów, a następnie kliknij, aby wystrzelić.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00059=Naciśnij klawisz „Q”, wyceluj we wrogów, a następnie kliknij lewy przycisk myszy, aby wystrzelić.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00061=Aktywuj Pocisk Penetrujący, wyceluj we wrogów, a następnie kliknij, aby wystrzelić.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00062=O to właśnie chodzi! Zdolności zadają więcej obrażeń niż podstawowe ataki.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00063=Przed tobą więcej szkieletów. Użyj Pocisku Penetrującego, żeby się z nimi rozprawić.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00064=Przed tobą stronnicy wroga. Pokonaj ich Pociskiem Penetrującym.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00065=Świetny strzał!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00066=Polecam. O wiele skuteczniejsze niż walenie jakimś młotkiem.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00067=Pamiętaj: dzięki Pociskowi Penetrującemu możesz wyeliminować całe grupy stronników.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00068=Przed nami zbyt wiele szkieletów... musimy się wycofać!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00069=Nie jest dobrze. Chłopaki straciły ochotę do walki.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00070=Dzięki Inspiracji dodasz odwagi nie tylko sobie, ale i swoim sojusznikom.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00071=Musisz podnieść na duchu tych piechurów, żeby mogli walczyć dalej.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00072=Teraz już nikt mi nie podskoczy! Szarża!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00073=Nie bądź taki chojrak!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00074=Inspiracja zapewnia tobie i pobliskim sojusznikom premię do szybkości ataku. Używaj jej, gdy tylko to będzie możliwe.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00075=Inspiracja wzmacnia zarówno ciebie jak i pobliskich sojuszników. Używaj jej, gdy tylko to będzie możliwe.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00076=Pamiętaj! Pocisk Penetrujący umożliwia zabicie grupy szkieletów w czasie, gdy twoi stronnicy walczą.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00077=Jeśli zainspirujesz swoich stronników, będą skuteczniejsi w walce ze szkieletami.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00078=Ta brawura was nie ocali. To kres waszego nędznego żywota.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00079=Nasi piechurzy wdali się w potyczkę z Diablo. Odblokuj kamerę, aby zobaczyć, co się tam dzieje.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00080=Doskonale. Teraz przewiń mapę. Przekonajmy się, co knuje Władca Grozy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00081=Pochłonie was ogień!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00082=Jest ranny! To doskonały moment, by zaatakować!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00083=Wystarczy nacisnąć spację, aby w dowolnym momencie wyśrodkować kamerę na bohaterze.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00084=Przenieś widok kamery z powrotem na bohatera i ruszajmy!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00085=Możesz w każdej chwili powrócić do trybu zablokowanej kamery, naciskając klawisz „L”.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00086=W każdej chwili możesz powrócić do trybu zablokowanej kamery.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00087=Ta kraina i jej nędzni mieszkańcy należą do mnie!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00088=Nie na mojej warcie!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00089=Diablo to twarda sztuka. Wykorzystaj Pocisk Penetrujący, aby go odrzucić.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00090=Będę dręczyć twą duszę przez wieczność, Jamesie Raynorze!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00091=Dobrze się spisałeś! Ale to jeszcze nie koniec.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00092=Użyj Kamienia Powrotu, aby wrócić do naszej bazy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00093=Nie ruszaj się i pozwól działać magii Kamienia Powrotu.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00094=A to ci dopiero...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00095=Oto Komnata Burz. To właśnie tutaj na początku każdej bitwy przywoływani są bohaterowie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00096=Naszym celem jest zniszczenie bazy wroga oraz obrona własnej bazy przed atakami.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00097=Z obu baz co jakiś czas wychodzą nowi stronnicy, którzy podążają tym szlakiem i walczą ze sobą w niezliczonych potyczkach.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00098=Kumam. Niszczymy bazę Diablo i jest po walce... Nic prostszego. Ale przypomnij mi jeszcze raz, po co to robimy?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00099=(poirytowane westchnienie) Wiesz co? Naprawdę nie należy się nad tym zbyt mocno zastanawiać.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00100=Najpierw ruszaj na pierwszą linię.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00101=Zszywa chce siem bawić!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00102=To nie było roztropne posunięcie. Samotny atak na wrogi fort to właściwie samobójstwo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00103=Stronnicy wspomogą cię podczas ataku na bazę. Trzymaj się za nimi i pozwól im przyjmować ataki.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00104=Atakuj wieże jedynie pod warunkiem, że ich ogień skierowany jest w inne cele.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00105=Dobra robota! Dowiodłeś swojej wartości!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00106=Co mogę powiedzieć? Mam talent do demolki.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00107=Sługi i kamień to żadne wyzwanie! Pożywię się twoim strachem!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00108=„Pożywisz się moim strachem”? Powtarzasz to już drugi raz! Wytłumaczę ci, jak to działa: strachu ani grozy nie można jeść.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00109=Mhmmm! On ma racje. Strach bez smaku.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00110=Widzisz? Nawet śmierdziel kuma.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00111=Dość!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00112=Czekaj no. Czy ja właśnie zginąłem?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00113=Bez obaw – w Nexusie śmierć jest jedynie przejściową niedogodnością. Po chwili odradzasz się w pełni sił.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00114=Tuszę, że pozwolisz mi tym razem do siebie dołączyć? To powinno wyrównać szanse.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00115=Mi pasuje... Zbierajmy majdan.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00116=Wskakuj na rumaka i ruszamy do boju!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00117=Jeśli wskoczysz na rumaka, szybciej dotrzemy na linię frontu.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00118=Możesz zsiąść z wierzchowca, naciskając klawisz przywołania.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00119=Ostrożnie. Nie zawsze będę w pobliżu, by ci pomóc.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00120=Ostrożnie, chłopcze. Znowu ocaliłem ci skórę.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00121=Zbieraj kule, które regenerują twoje zdrowie i manę.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00122=Wrogie wieże zadają dotkliwe obrażenia, ale zawsze w pierwszej kolejności strzelają w stronników.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00123=Atakuj wieżę tylko wtedy, gdy w pobliżu są stronnicy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00124=Wycofaj się, szybko! Powrócimy, gdy przybędą stronnicy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00125=Pozwól naszym stronnikom osłaniać cię i brać na siebie ataki.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00126=Używaj Pocisku Penetrującego oraz Inspiracji, żeby rozprawić się z przeciwnikami.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00127=Jeśli zapomnisz komendy, możesz ją znaleźć tutaj, w lewym górnym rogu.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00128=Doskonale! Trzeba już tylko zniszczyć bazę wroga!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00129=Masz coś jeszcze do dodania, Diabolo?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00130=Zemszczę się, Jamesie Raynorze. To jeszcze nie koniec!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00131=Ej, to nie jest fair play!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00132=Nie zostawię cię na pastwę losu!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00133=Patrzcie, państwo... kogo to wciągnął Nexus. Miło cię widzieć, kowboju.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00134=Nova? No, teraz zaczynam się czuć jak u siebie!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00135=Tylko się nie przyzwyczajaj. Zaraz zacznie się ostra jazda.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00136=Ha, ha. Tylko takie lubię...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00137=Dawaj, czerwonoskóry, sprawdźmy, na co cię stać! Jestem gotowy na drugą rundę.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00138=<Roar>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00139=Mam nadzieję, że jesteś gotów. To już nie są ćwiczenia.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00140=Urodziłem się gotowy…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00141=Pamiętaj, jeśli odniesiesz rany na polu walki, możesz wrócić do Dworu Burz, gdzie zostaną one automatycznie wyleczone.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00142=Naszym celem – tak jak poprzednio – jest pokonanie wrogiej drużyny i zniszczenie ich bazy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00143=Z tego co widzę, do bazy wroga prowadzą trzy drogi. Lepiej zadbajmy, żeby ktoś zabezpieczał każdą z nich.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00144=Wiesz już co i jak. Kiedy zacznie się bitwa, trzymaj się mnie i przygotuj się do walki.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00145=Kiedy zabijasz stronników i bohaterów lub niszczysz budynki wroga, nasza drużyna zdobywa doświadczenie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00146=Wspólnie zdobywamy doświadczenie, a wszystko, co robisz, przyczynia się do sukcesu całej drużyny.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00147=Ten pasek pokazuje doświadczenie i aktualny poziom obu drużyn.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00148=Kiedy niebieski pasek wypełni się całkowicie, nasza drużyna awansuje i staniemy się potężniejsi.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00149=No to zdobądźmy kolejny poziom.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00150=Dobrze, mamy kolejny poziom!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00151=Poprawiły się twoje współczynniki, a zdolności zyskały na sile.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00152=To bardzo pomocne. Masz dla mnie jeszcze coś fajnego?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00153=Awansowanie odblokowuje także talenty, które pozwalają zmienić twoje zdolności i styl walki.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00154=Ej, nieźle! Od razu czuję się silniejszy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00155=Właśnie odblokowałeś zdolność bohaterską. Jest to niezwykle potężna umiejętność, która może przeważyć szalę bitwy. Uważaj z nią.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00156=Zdolność bohaterska, hę? Bardzo chętnie ją wypróbuję.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00157=Niech to. Nie czuję się najlepiej.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00158=Aby odzyskać zdrowie, kliknij prawym przyciskiem myszy na studni leczenia.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00159=Aby odzyskać zdrowie, kliknij studnię leczenia lewym przyciskiem myszy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00160=Aby odzyskać zdrowie, kliknij studnię leczenia lewym przyciskiem myszy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00161=No, od razu lepiej. Kiedy napijesz się ze studni leczenia, twoja mana i zdrowie zaczną się regenerować.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00162=Zanim skorzystasz z niej po raz kolejny, musisz odczekać, aż znowu się napełni.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00163=Jim, wycofaj się! Szybko!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00164=Muszę się wycofać.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00165=Jim, przydałaby się nam w tej chwili twoja pomoc. Chcemy „zachęcić” te giganty oblężnicze do przejścia na naszą stronę.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00166=Zachęcić?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00167=To lepsza zabawa, niż sobie wyobrażasz. Zaufaj mi...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00168=Poczekaj chwilę na znaczniku.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00169=Bardzo dobrze. Najemnicy pokonani w obozie będą walczyć dla nas i zaatakują wroga na najbliższej alei.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00170=Dobra, ja to widzę tak – eskortujmy te stwory do fortu wroga i go rozwalmy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00171=Giganty oblężnicze są bardzo skuteczne, gdy trzeba zniszczyć fort z dużej odległości.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00172=Jim, przydałoby się nam wsparcie. Zdobądź ten obóz najemników.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00173=Pamiętaj, aby używać swoich zdolności w walce!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00175=Teraz ruszaj do strażnicy. Jeśli zdołasz ją zdobyć, zyskamy ważny punkt obserwacyjny na tym obszarze.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00176=Zaczekaj chwilę w pobliżu, a strażnica się uaktywni.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00177=Wycofaj się! Niebezpiecznie jest atakować wieżę bez wsparcia stronników.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00178=Ostrożnie! W pobliżu nie ma nikogo, kto ochroniłby cię przed ostrzałem!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00179=Szybciej, chłopcze! Potrzebujemy twojej pomocy z gigantami!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00180=Lepiej pomogę Utherowi, zanim dziadek stetryczeje... jeszcze bardziej.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00181=Jim, mógłbyś mi trochę pomóc na tej alei?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00182=Muszę zapamiętać, żeby częściej korzystać z tych zdolności.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00183=Trochę cię poturbowali – skorzystaj ze studni leczenia.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00184=Skończyła ci się mana. Napij się ze studni leczenia albo użyj Kamienia Powrotu, aby teleportować się do bazy i odnowić manę oraz zdrowie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00185=Chyba warto by zająć ten obóz najemników.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00186=Mam mało zdrowia, a studnia jest sucha. Lepiej wykorzystam Kamień Podróżny i wrócę do naszej bazy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00187=Jeśli wskoczysz na rumaka, szybciej dotrzesz na miejsce.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00188=Dosiądź wierzchowca, aby zwiększyć swoją szybkość ruchu. Domyślny skrót klawiszowy to „Z”.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00189=Nie mam czasu na ceregiele. Wybierz linię i szykuj się do walki.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00190=Jak dobrze, kula regeneracji! Tego potrzebowałem.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00191=Nie zapomnij wybrać nowego talentu.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00192=Wróg zajął naszą strażnicę. Jeśli to możliwe, powinniśmy ją odbić.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00193=Pocisk Penetrujący szybko załatwiłby całą tę grupę.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00194=Jim, użyj Inspiracji, by wzmocnić skuteczność naszych ataków!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00195=Prawe kliknięcie myszy anuluje użycie zdolności. Aby użyć zdolności, kliknij lewym przyciskiem myszy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00197=Anulowałeś użycie zdolności. Sprawdź, czy naciskasz właściwy przycisk myszy, aby wystrzelić Pocisk Penetrujący.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00198=Prawe kliknięcie anuluje użycie zdolności. Aby przyzwać Hyperiona, kliknij lewym przyciskiem.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00200=Anulowałeś użycie zdolności. Sprawdź, czy naciskasz właściwy przycisk myszy, aby przyzwać Hyperiona.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00201=Gdy zacznie ci brakować zdrowia, napij się ze studni leczenia. Możesz też teleportować się do bazy, aby stopniowo odzyskać całe zdrowie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00202=Nie szarżuj na wroga, kiedy masz mało zdrowia – bo dasz się zabić, przeciwnik otrzyma doświadczenie, a my stracimy sojusznika.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00203=Aby wrócić do bazy, użyj Kamienia Powrotu. Najpierw upewnij się, że w pobliżu nie ma żadnych wrogów albo dobrze się ukryj.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00204=Ej! Przeszkadzasz mi w powrocie!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00205=Używanie Kamienia Powrotu zajmuje trochę czasu i może być przerwane atakami wrogów. Korzystaj z niego tylko, gdy jest bezpiecznie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00206=To mi wygląda na robotę w sam raz dla Hyperiona.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00207=Założę się, że Hyperion załatwiłby ich wszystkich na raz.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00208=Kim ty właściwie jesteś? Jakimś rycerzem?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00209=Tak właściwie, to paladynem.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00210=Nie dzielmy włosa na czworo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00211=Nie… Paladyni władają potężną mocą…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00212=Pozwól, że w tym miejscu ci przerwę, kolego. Naprawdę nie muszę wiedzieć...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00213=Nie ma co, Nova, dobrze cię widzieć.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00214=Szkoda, że nie mogę powiedzieć tego samego o tobie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00215=Ej, Diablo... Chyba zaczynam czuć twój strach...

Conversation/Spooky18/Line00001=Naprzód, generałowie! Ruszajcie, by zabijać w moim imieniu! Taka jest wola Władcy Kruków.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00002=Królewski Płaskowyż upadnie. To lekcja dla wszystkich, którzy ośmielają się sprzeciwiać Władcy Kruków.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00003=Potęga Władcy Kruków obróci to żałosne królestwo w perzynę.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00004=Zario, Upiorny Rycerzu, oczyść tę krainę swym nieczystym płomieniem.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00005=Sądzisz, że zdołasz stawić czoło moim generałom? Nie rozśmieszaj mnie. <śmiech>
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00006=Kto ośmiela się podnosić rękę na mego Upiornego Rycerza? A, to ty. Powinienem był się tego spodziewać.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00007=Widzę, że jeden z mych generałów został pokonany. Cóż z was za upiorne szkodniki.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00008=Staje przed wami Alexstraza, Widmowa Smoczyca, Nieumarły Aspekt.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00009=Widmowa Smoczyco, Władca Kruków nakazuje ci służyć ku swej chwale!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00010=<gniewne sapnięcie> Jak udało się wam zabić to, co już nie żyło?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00011=Widmowa Smoczyca poległa? Heh. To jeszcze nie koniec.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00012=Wiedźmo z Kotliny, nadszedł czas, by tę krainę spotkała zasłużona kara!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00013=Królewski Płaskowyż zapłaci za swe zuchwalstwo.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00014=Przeklinam was, intruzi.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00015=Giń wreszcie!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00016=Pajęcza Nadzorczyni, mam dla ciebie nową ofiarę.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00017=Wyśledźcie mych wrogów, generałowie. A gdy ich odnajdziecie, nie miejcie litości.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00018=Łowy dobiegły końca, ale wojna dopiero się zaczyna.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00019=A zatem udało ci się zgładzić tego, kto cię ścigał. <westchnienie> Nużą mnie już te szarady.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00020=Oczekiwaliście, że tak łatwo uda się wam to zakończyć?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00021=A zatem udało się wam pokonać moich generałów. Niech tak będzie. Zobaczymy, jak sobie poradzicie w starciu ze Smoczym Rycerzem.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00022=Cieszcie się nic niewartym zwycięstwem, bohaterowie, albowiem Królewski Płaskowyż przestał istnieć.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00023=Zwyciężyliście, bohaterowie. Jesteście obrońcami krainy w zgliszczach. <śmiech>
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00024=Tacy z was spryciarze, co?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00025=Relikt przeszłości...
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00026=<pogardliwe prychnięcie>. Ten bezużyteczny relikt do niczego się wam nie przyda.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00027=Cóż za strata czasu.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00031=Dość już tego.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00032=Śmiesz sprzeciwiać się Władcy Kruków?!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00033=Nie...
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00034=Rzec, że utraciliście moją przychylność, byłoby niedopowiedzeniem.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00035=To prawda, udało się wam osłabić moją armię, ale nic nie powstrzyma mego gniewu.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00036=Królewski Płaskowyż padnie tej nocy. Taka jest wola Władcy Kruków!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00037=Bohaterowie, chwytajcie za broń i zgładźcie sługusów Władcy Kruków!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00038=Dzisiaj Władca Kruków pozna gorzki smak porażki. Królewski Płaskowyż nigdy nie będzie do niego należeć!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00039=Położymy kres nieprawości Władcy Kruków. Nie zamierzam dłużej tolerować jego napaści.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00040=Upiorny Rycerz w służbie Władcy Kruków chce spalić moją krainę. Ugaście jego świętokradczy płomień.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00041=Ten pusty pancerz to jeden z generałów Władcy Kruków. Zginie tak samo, jak jego zwierzchnik.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00042=Żaden upiór nie może się równać z prawdziwym rycerzem Królewskiego Płaskowyżu.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00043=Nie lękaj się, Władco Kruków. Rychło dołączysz do swego Upiornego Rycerza.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00044=Władca Kruków ośmiela się posyłać smoka do ataku na Królewski Płaskowyż?! Głupiec.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00045=Nieumarły Aspekt był niegdyś istotą piękną i szlachetną. Dziś służy podłemu okrutnikowi. Uwolnijcie jej duszę.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00046=Niech ta śmierć wyswobodzi duszę smoka.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00047=Królewski Płaskowyż to kraina tętniąca życiem. Nie ma tu miejsca dla nieumarłych.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00048=To się nie skończy, dopóki nie padniesz pokonany u naszych stóp, Władco Kruków.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00049=Wiedźma z Kotliny zawarła mroczny pakt w zamian za wielką moc, jednak nawet ona nie sprosta sile naszego oręża.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00050=Ta wiedźma chce nas „ukarać”. Pokażcie jej prawdziwe znaczenie tego słowa.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00051=Jej plugawa magia nie bezcześci już mojej krainy.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00052=Moc klątwy została przełamana, Władco Kruków. A twoja wiedźma nie będzie się już nam naprzykrzać.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00053=Władca Kruków wysłał swą Pajęczą Nadzorczynię na polowanie – ale mylił się, jeśli sądził, że to my będziemy zwierzyną.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00054=Niebawem łowczyni przekona się, że sama stała się zwierzyną.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00055=Ha, dobry pająk to płaski pająk.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00056=Snuj swoje sieci, Władco Kruków. Rozerwiemy je wszystkie.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00057=Smoczy Rycerz został splugawiony?! Zapłacisz mi za to świętokradztwo, Władco Kruków!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00058=Nie... Ukochany! ... To niewybaczalne! Bohaterowie, czyńcie swą powinność.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00059=A zatem... wszystko... na marne?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00060=Nawet jeśli pochłonie mnie moc klątwy, Królewski Płaskowyż... przetrwa...
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00061=Królewski Płaskowyż zatriumfuje nad Mrocznym Nexusem!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00062=Popełniłeś błąd, napadając na moją krainę, Władco Kruków.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00063=Echo waszych czynów wybrzmiewać będzie po kres dziejów, bohaterowie.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00064=Nasi szlachetni wojownicy nie mogą zostać pokonani przez te plugawe monstra!

Conversation/Toy18/Line00002=No, to jest plansza i na niej gramy. Ty jesteś tym pionkiem...  I tutaj są kostki i karty też. O, i naklejki. Ale super!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00003=Jak chcesz wygrać to trzeba okrążyć planszę, a po drodze wykonywać zadania i zbierać czadowe nagrody. No dalej, rzucaj!

Conversation/Toy18/Line00015=Okej, słuchaj... Powiem ci tajemnicę. Może tak być, że zniszczyłem broń Valeery, którą gra moja siostra. Musisz ją teraz naprawić, albo będę w strasznych tarapatach, więc... Dalej! Nowe zadanie! Tylko szybko!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00016=Udało ci się! Super! Ogromniaste dzięki! Łoo! To się mogło bardzo źle skończyć. Ale się udało! W nagrodę weź to.

Conversation/Toy18/Line00029=Hej, to nieuczciwe! Oszukujesz!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00030=Hej! Tego nie ma w regułach! A nawet jeśli jest, to zaraz nie będzie!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00031=Hej, nie rób tego. No przestań!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00032=Rób tak dalej, a pozbieram zabawki i pójdę do domu!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00033=Hej, nie miałem pojęcia, że tak można! Ale super!

Conversation/Toy18/Line00035=Ale super!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00036=Radzisz sobie dużo lepiej niż inni!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00037=Niemożliwe! Znaczy się, widziałem to, ale i tak nie wierzę!

Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00565=Spróbuj teraz otworzyć okno talentów.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00568=Często używaj zdolności bohaterskich. Zadają wrogom więcej obrażeń niż ataki podstawowe. Domyślne skróty klawiszowe to: „Q”, „W”, „E” i „R”.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00570=Bohaterowie ukryci w zaroślach są niewidoczni dla wrogów poza nimi. Bohaterowie stają się widoczni, kiedy wyjdą, albo gdy wróg dotrze tam, gdzie się ukrywają.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00571=Baza ma niezwykle silną osłonę, która się szybko regeneruje, kiedy nie jest atakowana.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00572=Zabito cię, ale nie przejmuj się. Za chwilkę odrodzisz się w swojej bazie.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00573=Staraj się mieć dużo punktów zdrowia i wycofywać się z walki, kiedy zacznie ci ich brakować. Wróg zdobywa doświadczenie, kiedy zginiesz.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00574=Twoja drużyna nie może przechodzić przez bramę główną wroga. Aby się przez nią przedostać, trzeba ją zniszczyć.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00575=Pokonaj najemników, aby dołączyli do walki po twojej stronie. Ich obozy najemników mają różne poziomy trudności. Nie atakuj trudniejszych obozów, póki się nie przygotujesz.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00576=Dosiądź wierzchowca, aby zwiększyć szybkość ruchu. Domyślny skrót klawiszowy to „Z”.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00577=Naciśnij spację, aby w dowolnym momencie wyśrodkować kamerę na bohaterze.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00578=Talenty znacznie wzmacniają zdolności twojego bohatera. Wybieraj talenty od razu, kiedy staną się dostępne.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00579=Zajęcie strażnicy zapewnia twojej drużynie widoczność obszaru wokół niej. Aby ją przechwycić, stań w kręgu obok niej.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00580=Drużyny zdobywają doświadczenie, zabijając bohaterów, stronników oraz niszcząc budowle. Aby zdobyć doświadczenie, trzeba być w pobliżu wroga w chwili jego śmierci.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00581=Forty dysponują spowalniającym atakiem, który zmniejsza twoją szybkość ruchu i ataku. Jeśli cię atakują, wydostań się z ich zasięgu.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00582=Kiedy napijesz się ze studni leczenia, twoja mana i zdrowie zaczną się odnawiać.

Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00587=Kamień Powrotu umożliwia teleportację do bazy. Użyj go, kiedy będziesz potrzebować leczenia lub many.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00588=Masz mało many. Napij się ze studni leczenia albo użyj Kamienia Powrotu, aby teleportować się do bazy i odnowić manę.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00589=Aby zwiększyć swoją szybkość ruchu, możesz dosiąść wierzchowca.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00590=W dowolnym momencie możesz wyśrodkować kamerę na bohaterze.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00591=Ataki wroga zrzucają bohatera z wierzchowca. Aby móc ponownie go dosiąść, ucieknij przeciwnikom.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00592=Ataki anulują teleportację za pomocą Kamienia Powrotu. Używaj go tylko w bezpiecznych miejscach.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00593=Doskonały wybór!
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00605=Pokonaj najemników, aby dołączyli do walki po twojej stronie. Obozy najemników mają różne oznaczenia w zależności od rodzaju jednostek oraz poziomu trudności.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00606=Pokonaj najemników, aby dołączyli do walki po twojej stronie. Ich obozy mają oznaczenia uzależnione od rodzaju jednostek i poziomu trudności. Są to: najemnicy oblężniczy, mocarni oraz bossowie.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00608=Witaj w wyzwaniu dla weteranów. Przed tobą cała seria prób, podczas których sprawdzisz swoje możliwości w ogniu walki. Zobaczymy, czy podołasz.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00611=Talenty mogą na przeróżne sposoby wpływać na twoje zdolności, a czasem nawet zapewnić zupełnie nowe umiejętności.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00612=Otwórzmy okno talentów. Przytrzymaj klawisz „Ctrl” lub naciśnij klawisz „N”.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00613=Wybierz talenty, które zwiększą obrażenia zadawane pojedynczym celom. Naprowadź wskaźnik myszki na talent, aby uzyskać więcej informacji.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00615=Wybranie talentu natychmiast ulepszy zdolność twojego bohatera.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00619=To się nazywa walka! Przed tobą kolejne wyzwanie, kiedy będziesz mieć dostęp do zdolności bohaterskich. Na pewno ci się spodobają.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00620=Zdolności bohaterskie sprawdzają się w określonych sytuacjach. Za chwilę sprawdzimy się w walce z wieloma przeciwnikami.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00621=Wygląda na to, że naszym sojusznikom przydałoby się wsparcie. Masz ochotę na małe starcie drużyn?
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00623=Jeśli zacznie ci brakować zdrowia lub many, możesz zaczerpnąć z tej studni leczenia.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00637=Udało ci się! Gratulacje! Nic nie może się równać z zasłużonym zwycięstwem na polu walki!
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00643=No więc tak: musisz zadać Ogrodowemu Koszmarowi jak najdotkliwsze obrażenia. Kliknij przycisk „Start”, kiedy tylko najdzie cię ochota, by rozpocząć.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00644=Zniszcz szybko ten Ogrodowy Koszmar! Zrób to dla mnie.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00645=Ha! Doskonały strzał! Udało ci się ogłuszyć kilku bohaterów za jednym razem!
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00649=Trzy.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00650=Dwa.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00651=Jeden.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00652=Do dzieła!
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00653=Nie najgorzej! Upewnij się, że wybrane przez ciebie talenty zwiększają obrażenia zadawane pojedynczemu celowi. Kliknij przycisk „Start”, aby raz jeszcze rozegrać to wyzwanie.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00656=W pierwszym wyzwaniu stawisz czoła potężnemu przeciwnikowi. Aby go pokonać, musisz ulepszyć swoje zdolności podstawowe.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00657=Och... Nie pogardziłbym wsparciem! Wybierz talenty, a następnie kliknij przycisk „Start”, aby pospieszyć nam z pomocą.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00658=Musisz najpierw ogłuszyć E.T.C. i przerwać Pogo. Dopiero wówczas nadarzy się okazja do ataku. Kliknij przycisk „Start”, aby zacząć od nowa.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00674=Kiedy szybko musisz pokonać sporą odległość, naciśnij klawisz „Z”, aby dosiąść wierzchowca.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00675=Zanim będziemy mogli kontynuować, musisz dokonać wyboru pozostałych talentów.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00679=Czas się stąd zabierać!
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00681=Kluczem do zwycięstwa jest nieprzerwane zadawanie obrażeń. Upewnij się, że używasz swoich zdolności natychmiast, gdy tylko są dostępne.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00684=Nie poddawaj się! Pamiętaj, że możesz znacząco zwiększyć obrażenia, jeśli uda ci się trafić wielu przeciwników swoją zdolnością bohaterską lub Wielostrzałem.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00698=Oby tak dalej! Wiesz już wszystko, czego ci potrzeba, by zwyciężyć w ostatnim starciu. Zaufaj instynktowi i nie ustawaj, dopóki wrogowie nie legną u twych stóp!
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00700=Przerwij działanie ogłuszania, a będziemy mogli dokończyć walkę. Wybierz talenty, a następnie kliknij przycisk „Start”, aby pospieszyć nam z pomocą.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00702=Spróbuj raz jeszcze, a na pewno ci się uda.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00703=Nie zniechęcaj się, te wyzwania z założenia są niełatwe.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00704=Każde wyzwanie można ukończyć na wiele sposobów. Czasami wystarczy przyjrzeć się swoim talentom i rozważyć dostępne możliwości, aby znaleźć najlepsze rozwiązanie.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00705=Widać, że się starasz! Naciśnij przycisk „Start”, aby spróbować raz jeszcze.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00706=Walcz dalej! Nie ma przeszkód nie do pokonania.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00707=Całkiem nieźle! Co ty na to, żeby spróbować raz jeszcze?
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00708=Za każdym razem uczysz się czegoś nowego o danej potyczce. Obserwuj przeciwników i wybieraj talenty, które pomogą ci wykorzystać ich słabe punkty.

Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00712=Jeśli chcesz wypróbować nowe talenty, naciśnij przycisk „Reset talentów”.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00713=W tym wyzwaniu skupiamy się na obrażeniach zadawanych pojedynczym celom. Dobrane przez ciebie talenty nie ułatwią ci walki.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00714=Pogo! E.T.C. ogłuszył nas swoją kakofoniczną muzyką i zmusił do tańca! Przydałaby się nam pomoc! I to szybko!
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00715=Aby nas uwolnić, potrzebujesz zdolności bohaterskiej, która ogłuszy E.T.C. Twoja obecna zdolność bohaterska nie ułatwi ci zadania.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00717=Naciśnij przycisk „Reset talentów”, jeśli chcesz zmienić swoją konfigurację postaci.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00718=Nie będziesz gromadzić złota ani kupować przedmiotów. Zamiast tego twoja postać będzie zdobywać kolejne poziomy i opanowywać nowe talenty.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00719=Możesz resetować swoje talenty, korzystając z przycisku „Reset talentów”.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00720=Aby ogłuszyć E.T.C. i uwolnić nas, potrzebujesz Deszczu Zemsty. Twoja obecna zdolność bohaterska nie ułatwi ci zadania.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00721=Możesz resetować swoje talenty, korzystając z przycisku „Reset talentów”.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00724=Tu, w Nexusie, wszyscy członkowie drużyny dzielą się zdobytym doświadczeniem i awansują na kolejne poziomy w tym samym czasie.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00725=Jeśli na każdej alei walczy bohater, drużyna otrzymuje pełne doświadczenie za zabijanie stronników... Dlatego możesz zwiedzić pole bitwy.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00726=W tym wyzwaniu będziesz kontrolować Zeratula – teleportującego się Zabójcę, który automatycznie zyskuje Ukrycie, kiedy nie bierze udziału w walce.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00727=Wykorzystaj jego zdolności, aby skrycie przemknąć między alejami i urządzać zasadzki na wrogich bohaterów.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00728=Nasza drużyna została w tyle, jeśli idzie o poziomy. Przemieszczaj się między alejami i eliminuj wrogich bohaterów, byśmy mogli doścignąć przeciwników.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00729=Musisz pokonać przeciwników na obu alejach, aby ukończyć to wyzwanie. Nie martw się, doświadczenie naszej drużyny nie ucierpi z powodu twoich wędrówek.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00730=Maskowanie Zeratula czyni go niewidzialnym dla przeciwników. Zasadź się na wrogich bohaterów i wyeliminuj ich, aby otrzymać sporo punktów doświadczenia.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00732=Zajmiemy się stronnikami. Ty skup się na wrogich bohaterach!
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00734=Wybór talentów wzmacnia zdolności twojego bohatera. Pamiętaj, możesz go dokonać w dowolnym miejscu na polu bitwy, nawet w ogniu walki.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00740=Przed tobą ostateczne wyzwanie! Za chwilę dowiesz się, jak zdobywać doświadczenie na alejach.

VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Dopóki jesteś władcą, muszę cię słuchać.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Że co?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Nie mam dla ciebie czasu.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Zgotujmy wrogom rzeź w imię mego pana.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroResponse_Zagara00=Jestem już w okowach jednego władcy. Nie potrzeba mi kolejnego.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Kill00=F-lakkh shir!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Kill01=Nakarmię mego władcę twoją duszą!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Kill02=Słyszysz głos pana?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Kill03=Z sieci śmierci nie ma ucieczki.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Kill04=Oto twój kres.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillAbathur00=Takie robactwo jak ty pożeram na śniadanie.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillArthas00=Nareszcie! Uwolniłem się od Ciebie!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillLeoric00=Twoja moc blednie przy potędze mego pana.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillSiegeTank00=Twoje maszyny są niczym przy potędze Plagi.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Drżyj przed moją mocą!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillSylvanas00=Śmierć nie przyniesie ci ulgi, wywłoko.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowLifeHeal00=Dziękuję za uzdrowienie.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowLifeHeal02=Uzdrawiasz mnie w samą porę, sługo.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowMana00=Brakuje mi many.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowMana01=Mam mało many.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowMana02=Potrzebuję więcej many.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/No00=Nie mogę tego zrobić.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/No01=Żądasz niemożliwego.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/No02=Nie.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Pomóżcie sojusznikowi.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Potrzebuję pomocy!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Do mnie, prędko!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zniszczyć bazę wroga!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Powinniśmy zająć ten obóz najemników.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zaatakujmy ten fort.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Zajmijmy tę strażnicę.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Nie dajcie zniszczyć naszej bazy!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Bronić tego fortu!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Musimy bronić tej strażnicy.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_KillHero00=Ten bohater ma umrzeć.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed00=Mów.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed01=Życie czeka. Czas ucieka.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed02=Nici przeznaczenia splatają się w sieć śmierci.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed03=Jestem pierwszym spośród Władców Krypt i sługą Króla Lisza. To klikanie mnie znieważa!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed04=Jeśli czujesz, że ziemia pod tobą drży, to jest już za późno.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed05=Że co? Znowu raaaajd?!?!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed06=W Naxramasie w szlamie brzmi chrząszcz. A czasami przemknie też wąż.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed07=Wydaje ci się, że jestem duży? Widocznie nie znasz mojej teściowej.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed08=Kiedy w nocy ktoś zastuka, możesz się spodziewać żuka.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed09=W puszczy drzew omszałych gąszczach warto czasem schrupać chrząszcza.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed10=Raz żem zjadł i mlaszczę wciąż... Ależ miękki miąsz miał chrząszcz!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed11=Brzezdań hżęździdź jak hżonżdż, bo cię pożdżuję żugiem!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed12=Wszystkie orki wyglądają i smakują tak samo. Ohydztwo! O-hydz-two!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed13=Jaki przeżyć w Nexusie? Opiszę jednym słowem. Sa-mo-wys-tar-czal-ność. Przywołujesz żuka... Chrup. Żuk... Chrup.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed14=Ongiś pewien chrząszcz wpadł w szał, bo gracz klikał, a nie grał.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Resurrected00=W samą porę.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Resurrected01=Tak! Wróciłem!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Revive00=O, wieczna ma niewola!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Revive01=Powstałem ponownie.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Revive02=Oto powracam z otchłani głębin.

VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Spec01=Przepełnia mnie moc.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Spec02=<evil cackle>
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Spec03=Istotnie.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Spec04=Oto nagroda za moją służbę.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Taunt00=To miejsce stanie się twoim grobem.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Taunt01=Czekają cię straszliwe męczarnie!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Taunt02=Moja potęga jest nie-zmie-rzo-na!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/TeamKilled00=Nic ich nie uchroni przed naszym gniewem.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_ExLocked00=Chcę walczyć!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Będę ci służył całą wieczność.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_Gift00=Wedle życzenia.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_Lockin00=Za Mroźny Tron!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_Purchase00=Będę ci służyć aż po grób... i jeszcze dłużej.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_Trial00=Pokażę ci potęgę władców krypt!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_Trial01=Tych, którzy rzucą mi wyzwanie, czekają męki i cierpienia!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Uwolnij mnie, a twoi wrogowie staną się moimi.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Może pokażę ci me talenty?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=<odgłos frustracji> Nie masz jakiejś bitwy do stoczenia?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Król Lisz był odziany w zbroję i zamrożony w lodzie, a i tak był bardziej aktywnym władcą od ciebie.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ultimate1Used00=Zapadnij w sieć śmierci.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ultimate1Used01=Już mi się nie wymkniesz!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ultimate2Used00=Poczuj gniew mego władcy!

VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Yes08=Cokolwiek każesz.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Attack00=Musimy atakować!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Attack01=Do ataku!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Attack02=Oto okazja do ataku!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Caution00=Nie podoba mi się tutaj. Zachowajmy ostrożność.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_GoodJob00=Znakomicie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_GoodJob01=Odwaga ci służy.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_GoodJob02=Masz duszę wojownika.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Heal00=Twoje rany są głębokie. Ulecz się!

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Retreat00=Musimy się wycofać!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Retreat01=Wycofać się!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Uhoh00=Niestety.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Uhoh01=Los nam nie sprzyjał.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Uhoh02=Łączę się z tobą w bólu, przyjacielu.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack00=Zniszczyć ich!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack01=Shakal zen! (tłum.: Zniszczyć ich!)
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack02=Przez poświęcenie ku zwycięstwu!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack03=En taro Tassadar!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack04=Dosięgnie ich ramię sprawiedliwości.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack05=Walczmy z ciemnością!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack06=To moje brzemię.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Celebrate00=To była wspaniała walka, wojownicy!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Celebrate01=Sprostaliśmy wyzwaniu!

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Healed02=Jestem wdzięczny, przyjacielu.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroAgree00=Tak się stanie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroAgree01=Z twoich ust płynie prawda.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroAgree02=Ku chwale daelaamów!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroBoast00=Nasza wiara zwycięży.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroBoast01=Wróg ulegnie przed naszą potęgą.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion00=Gotowi stawić czoła naszym wrogom?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion01=Czy jesteście gotowi do walki?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Alarak00=Wielki Wódz Alarak? Cóż za niespodzianka...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Condescending00=Widzę, że jesteś na bardzo wczesnym etapie ewolucji.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Dismissive00=Czynię to, co muszę!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Fenix00=Fenix!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Cóż to za zergowe plugastwo?!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Czemu to ty właśnie jesteś moim sojusznikiem?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Z radością stanę do walki u twego boku.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Raynor00=Honorem jest dla mnie znowu walczyć u twego boku, przyjacielu Raynorze.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Tassadar00=Mentorze... Prowadź nas w walce.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Zeratul00=Nasze spotkanie sprawia mi wielką radość, stary przyjacielu.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Mam się sprzymierzyć z zergiem? Ech, niech i tak będzie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond00=Wojna mnie ukształtowała.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond01=Wrogowie pożałują, że weszli nam w drogę!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond02=Jesteśmy niewzruszeni w obliczu niebezpieczeństwa.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=Niczym się nie różnimy, Alaraku.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Jeżeli tli się w tobie jeszcze chociaż iskra mądrości, to zachowasz milczenie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Fenix00=Pokażemy im prawdziwą potęgę templariuszy!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Co?! Nie zamierzam zaszczycić tego czegoś odpowiedzią.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Nie potrzebuję Khali, żeby wiedzieć, co o tym myślisz.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Wróg nie oprze się naszej potędze!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Raynor00=Błądzę po Nexusie gotując się do walki... Ale poza tym wszystko w jak najlepszym porządku.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Tassadar00=Za chwałę Aiuru!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Zeratul00=Anon por-ghal! (tłum.: Do boju!)
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Zakończymy dysputę po bitwie, plugastwo.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill00=Brak ci honoru.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill01=Cóż za rozczarowanie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill02=Nie masz szans w konfrontacji z ostrzami templariusza.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill03=Ci, którzy dopuszczają podziały, kończą marnie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill04=Hm, niższa forma życia...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillAlarak00=Taki wyczyn nie zdarza się co dzień.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillKerrigan00=To za Raszagal!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillProtoss00=Trzeba było do mnie dołączyć.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillRaynor00=Wybacz, przyjacielu Raynorze.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Dość tego!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillTassadar00=Najwyraźniej uczeń przerósł mistrza.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillZeratul00=Oby następnym razem Adun cię osłonił.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillZerg00=Oczyszczę galaktykę z twojego plugastwa.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Laugh00=<bemused laugh>
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal00=Zupełnie jak Astralne Wichry!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal01=Nie zapomnę ci okazanej dobroci.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal02=Twoje wsparcie mnie ocaliło, przyjacielu.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana00=Brakuje mi many.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana01=Kończy mi się mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana02=Potrzebuję więcej many.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No00=Nie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No01=To niewykonalne.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No02=To niemożliwe.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Nasz sojusznik potrzebuje pomocy.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Zostań ze mną!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Zagraża mi nieprzyjaciel.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zniszczyć bazę wroga!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Zawładnijmy tym obozem najemników.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zrównać ten fort z ziemią!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Musimy zająć tę wieżę.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Brońmy naszej bazy, zanim będzie za późno!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Trzeba bronić naszego fortu!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Utrzymać tę strażnicę!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_KillHero00=Musimy zgładzić wroga!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed00=Nastanie świt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed01=W jedności siła.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed02=Ta kraina obfituje w pytania, ale skąpi odpowiedzi...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed03=Czy w stworzeniu Nexusa maczali palce xel'naga? Jeśli tak, to nie pozostawili po sobie świątyń... Żadnych nowych form życia...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed04=No chyba, że te formy życia są niewidzialne... i kontrolują nas poprzez jakiś skomplikowany mechanizm cyfrowy. Coś jakby... aplikację sieciową.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed05=Być może istnieją setki tysięcy tych form życia... I wszystkie manipulują naszymi losami? Ech, już wystarczy! Od tego dumania rozbolała mnie głowa.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed06=Ciekawe, co porabiają daelaamowie pod moją nieobecność. Mam tylko nadzieję, że nie poprzestawiali mi mebli w komnacie narad. Nie znoszę, kiedy to robią.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed07=Hm, Włócznia Aduna znajduje się dokładnie nad moją głową, ale po fazmatorze Karaxie ani śladu. Ech, typowe...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed08=Przestaniesz mnie wreszcie szturchać? Spróbuj rozładować nadmiar agresji na jednym z orków i przekonaj się, jak im się to podoba.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed09=StarCraft to nie jest po prostu Warcraft w kosmosie... A to całe Heroes of the Storm w ogóle się nie liczy.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed10=Jestem dumny z mojego postępu. Zaczynałem jako pierwszopoziomowy templariusz. I przez całą grę biegałem w samej przepasce!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed11=Obecny zestaw pancerza zbierałem przez siedemnaście lat! Arcymistrzowski Protoski Pancerz +10 do Chwały!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed12=A wy od jak dawna zbieracie swój zestaw? Pewnie najwyżej od dziesięciu lat. Amatorzy!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed13=Jestem młodzikiem wyłącznie według rachuby protosów. Istnieję w tym wszechświecie o dwa stulecia dłużej niż większość tu obecnych i domagam się należytego szacunku!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed14=Zgromadziłem na swoim okręcie templariuszy wszystkich frakcji. Chyba przemianuję go na „Arkę Przymierza”.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected00=Powracam znad krawędzi.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected01=Składam ci podziękowania.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive00=Musimy walczyć jako jedność.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive01=Nie mogę zawieść.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec00=Mądry wybór.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec01=Jestem zaintrygowany.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec02=A więc taki jest nasz plan...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec03=Hmm... dobra strategia.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec04=To mi się bardzo przyda.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt00=Zachowujesz się jak przedstawiciel bardziej... prymitywnej cywilizacji.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt01=Jeśli nie zabije cię własna głupota, moje ostrza dokończą dzieła.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt02=Moja medytacja jest zakończona. Czy twoja w ogóle się zaczęła?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/TeamKilled00=To tylko ciemność poprzedzająca nadejście świtu.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExLocked00=Jeśli chcemy sięgnąć po zwycięstwo, musimy zachować jedność.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Harak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Gift00=Z radością służę pomocą.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Lockin00=Wybiła nasza godzina.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Purchase00=Walczymy o wspólną sprawę!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial00=Templariusz jest zawsze otwarty na przyjęcie nowych nauk.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial01=Z chęcią stawię czoła nowemu wyzwaniu.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked00=W tej krainie nie należy podejmować pochopnie żadnych działań.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Widzę, że niczego nie czynisz pochopnie. Podziwiam taką postawę.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Czas na zadumę minął.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Trwa walka! Nie możemy zwlekać!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used00=Ognia, Włócznio Aduna!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used01=Aktywować Promień Oczyszczenia!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used02=Rozpocząć Oczyszczenie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate2Used00=Przesłonić im pole widzenia!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate2Used01=Ukażę ci moc protoskiej arki!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate2Used02=Wzrok was zawiedzie!

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Kill02=Nie masz szans w konfrontacji z ostrzami templariusza.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Kill03=Ci, którzy dopuszczają podziały, kończą marnie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Kill04=Hm, niższa forma życia...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/KillKerrigan00=To za Feniksa!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/KillProtoss00=Trzeba było do mnie dołączyć.

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_AttackMerc00=Zawładnijmy tym obozem najemników.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zrównać ten fort z ziemią!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_AttackTower00=Musimy zająć tę wieżę.

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed00=Nastanie świt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed01=W jedności siła.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed02=Ta kraina obfituje w pytania, ale skąpi odpowiedzi...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed03=Czy w stworzeniu Nexusa maczali palce xel'naga? Jeśli tak, to nie pozostawili po sobie świątyń... Żadnych nowych form życia...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed04=No chyba, że te formy życia są niewidzialne... i kontrolują nas poprzez jakiś skomplikowany mechanizm cyfrowy. Coś jakby... aplikację sieciową.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed05=Być może istnieją setki tysięcy tych form życia... I wszystkie manipulują naszymi losami? Ech, już wystarczy! Od tego dumania rozbolała mnie głowa.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed06=Ciekawe, co porabiają daelaamowie pod moją nieobecność. Mam tylko nadzieję, że nie poprzestawiali mi mebli w komnacie narad. Nie znoszę, kiedy to robią.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed07=Hm, Włócznia Aduna znajduje się dokładnie nad moją głową, ale po fazmatorze Karaxie ani śladu. Ech, typowe... Przynajmniej nie marudzi, że potrzebuje solarytu.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed08=Hm, Włócznia Aduna znajduje się dokładnie nad moją głową, ale po fazmatorze Karaxie ani śladu. Ech, typowe...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed09=Przestaniesz mnie wreszcie szturchać? Spróbuj rozładować nadmiar agresji na jednym z orków i przekonaj się, jak im się to podoba.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed10=StarCraft to nie jest po prostu Warcraft w kosmosie... A to całe Heroes of the Storm w ogóle się nie liczy.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed11=Jestem dumny z mojego postępu. Zaczynałem jako pierwszopoziomowy templariusz. I przez całą grę biegałem w samej przepasce!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed12=Obecny zestaw pancerza zbierałem przez siedemnaście lat! Arcymistrzowski Protoski Pancerz +10 do Chwały!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed13=A wy od jak dawna zbieracie swój zestaw? Pewnie najwyżej od dziesięciu lat. Amatorzy!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed14=Jestem młodzikiem wyłącznie według rachuby protosów. Istnieję w tym wszechświecie o dwa stulecia dłużej niż większość tu obecnych i domagam się należytego szacunku!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed15=Zgromadziłem na swoim okręcie templariuszy wszystkich frakcji. Chyba przemianuję go na „Arkę Przymierza”.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected00=Powracam znad krawędzi.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected01=Składam ci podziękowania.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Revive00=Musimy walczyć jako jedność.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Revive01=Nie mogę zawieść.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec00=Mądry wybór.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec01=Jestem zaintrygowany.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec02=A więc taki jest nasz plan...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec03=Hmm... dobra strategia.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec04=To mi się bardzo przyda.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt00=Zachowujesz się jak przedstawiciel bardziej... prymitywnej cywilizacji.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt01=Jeśli nie zabije cię własna głupota, moje ostrza dokończą dzieła.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt02=Moja medytacja jest zakończona. Czy twoja w ogóle się zaczęła?
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/TeamKilled00=To tylko ciemność poprzedzająca nadejście świtu.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_ExLocked00=Jeśli chcemy sięgnąć po zwycięstwo, musimy zachować jedność.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_ExPurchased00=Harak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Gift00=Z radością służę pomocą.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Lockin00=Wybiła nasza godzina.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Purchase00=Walczymy o wspólną sprawę!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial00=Templariusz jest zawsze otwarty na przyjęcie nowych nauk.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial01=Z chęcią stawię czoła nowemu wyzwaniu.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked00=W tej krainie nie należy podejmować pochopnie żadnych działań.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked01=Widzę, że niczego nie czynisz pochopnie. Podziwiam taką postawę.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased00=Czas na zadumę minął.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased01=Trwa walka! Nie możemy zwlekać!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used00=Ognia, Włócznio Aduna!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used01=Aktywować Promień Oczyszczenia!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used02=Rozpocząć Oczyszczenie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate2Used00=Przesłonić im pole widzenia!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate2Used01=Ukażę ci moc protoskiej arki!

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed05=Dowodzenie Porucznikami Grzechu nie jest łatwe. Lenistwo wciąż się spóźnia, Gniew jest niepokorny, Pycha myśli, że Chciwość ją okrada, Zazdrości nie podoba się, że Chciwości uchodzi to na sucho, a Obżarstwo chce wszystkich pożreć. A co do Pożądania to... to BARDZO mnie rozprasza.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed10=Myślisz, że twoja rodzinka jest z piekła rodem? Ja dosłownie dorastałem wśród Władców Piekieł. Nasze dziecięce wybryki niszczyły całe królestwa.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed11=Tym, którzy myślą, że istnieje tylko siedem grzechów głównych, brakuje wyobraźni.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed12=To zaczyna boleć bardziej niż wszystkie moje kolczykowania.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed13=Czy wszyscy mogliby się na chwilę uspokoić? Muszę napisać serię ksiąg opisujących tę bitwę, a potem potrzebuję czasu, żeby porozrzucać je po polu walki!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed14=Co? Jak śmiesz nazywać mnie „pomniejszym” złem! Wolę określenie „zły inaczej”.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed15=Dobra, niech będzie. Zdradzę ci w końcu największą tajemnicę. Na drugie imię mam Grzechu.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt01=Nie będę tolerować twojej bezczelności!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt02=Wybacz mi, albowiem zamierzam zgrzeszyć.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/TeamKilled00=Nieważne. Ostatecznie to my zwyciężymy!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExLocked00=Ja jestem prawdziwym Władcą Piekieł!

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Łaknę walki i świeżej krwi...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used00=Myślicie, że wiecie, co to cierpienie?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used01=Niech zgubią was grzechy!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used02=Lękacie się swojego końca?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used00=<śmieje się> Myśleliście, że jesteście sprytni.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used01=Spustoszyć ten świat!

VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed01=Lepiej uważaj na swoje słowa.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed02=Przysięgam, jeśli ktoś znowu nazwie mnie „Barbie” na Battle.necie, to dostanie toporem w czoło.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed03=Bul-Kathosie. Nigdy się do ciebie nie modliłam. Nie znam odpowiednich słów. Nikt nie zapamięta, czemu walczyliśmy i czemu ginęliśmy. Ważne jest, że piątka stanęła przeciwko piątce. Mam do ciebie tylko jedną prośbę. Popraw moje statystyki. A jeśli mnie nie słuchasz – to idź do DIABŁA.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed04=Pomyślmy... Zmiażdżyć wrogów... gotowe. Przepędzić ich... no, oczywiście. Słuchać lamentu ich kobiet... e, to sobie darujmy.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed05=Ty! Śmierć przez snu snu!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed06=Blondynki lepiej się bawią, ale to z RUDYMI jest lepsza zabawa.

VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed10=Jak się dowiem, kto wymyślił kolczugę bikini, to wybiję mu żuchwę z gęby.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed11=Raz taki jeden za dużo na mnie klikał. No i teraz nie ma już czym.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed12=Wiesz, już od dawna czekam na coś lepszego niż potyczki.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed13=Czekaj, czekaj, zapiszę to sobie... Prawy przycisk to ruch, a atak to... też prawy przycisk... No więc co robi lewy przycisk? Nienawidzę uczyć się całego sterowania od nowa!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed14=Mój lud ma takie powiedzenie: „Kiedy pada śnieg, załóż cieplejszą przepaskę”.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed15=Hm, mam większe miecze niż ty... No, nie ma się czego wstydzić! To się przytrafia wielu mężczyznom.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Resurrected00=Zawdzięczam ci życie.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Resurrected01=Jestem twoją dłużniczką.

VoiceOver/Barbarian/TeamKilled00=Zemszczę się za to!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_ExLocked00=Mów, człowieczku.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_ExPurchased00=Starożytni mają nas w opiece.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Gift00=Twój sojusznik to mój sojusznik.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Lockin00=Kieruj moimi ostrzami.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Purchase00=Nie pożałujesz.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Trial00=Niech moje czyny mówią za mnie.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Trial01=Chętnie się sprawdzę.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitLocked00=Mam dosyć czekania. Zanurzmy ostrza we krwi wrogów.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitLocked01=Chodź, nasi wrogowie proszą się, by pociąć ich na plasterki.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitPurchased00=Bierzmy się do dzieła. Moja furia słabnie.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitPurchased01=Gap się tak dalej, a wydłubię ci gały.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ultimate1Used00=Nadchodzę!

VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillDwarf00=Oj... Niektóre krasnoludy mają jednak słabą głowę.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillLiLi00=Najważniejsze, że się starasz, Li Li. A teraz wstań, spróbujemy jeszcze raz.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillRexxar00=Rexxarze, czy ty aby czasem nie liniejesz? <śmiech>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSamuro00=Lepiej się napić, niż machać mieczem.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSkeletonKing00=Łaa, musisz trochę przytyć! Kości ci wyłażą!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Wszystko ma swój kres.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Laugh00=<śmiech>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal00=Dziękuję... Zaczynało się robić nieciekawie.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ach! Od razu lepiej!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal02=<śmiech> Dobrze, że jesteś.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana00=Napić mi się trza.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana01=Chyba czas na łyk z antałka.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana02=Kto się chce napić? Bo ja tak!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No00=Nie sądzę.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No01=Nie tym razem, przyjacielu.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No02=I jak miałbym to zrobić?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Szybko, trzeba pomóc sojusznikowi!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Ech, przydałaby mi się tu pomoc!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Przyjaciele, pomóżcie mi!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zaatakujmy bazę wroga!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Trzeba zająć ten obóz najemników.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zniszczyć ten fort!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Zajmijmy tę strażnicę.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Bronić bazy!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Powinniśmy bronić tego fortu.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Powinniśmy bronić tej strażnicy.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_KillHero00=Dobrze by było zlikwidować tego bohatera.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed00=Hej ho!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed01=Ktoś tu sobie nieźle nawarzył.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed02=Jestem kwiatem lotosu na spokojnej tafli jeziora...
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed03=O, tak... Znam całe mnóstwo wspaniałych opowieści. Chcesz usłyszeć jedną z nich? <beat> Dycha za minutę.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed04=Pewien ciekawy jegomość powiedział mi kiedyś: „Nigdy nie gaś całkowicie swego pragnienia, przyjacielu”. <pfu> Cóż za okropny pomysł! <SFX: łyk z kufla> Ach, od razu lepiej!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed05=Nie waż się warzyć nierozważnie. To bardzo ważne.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed06=Jak to, z kolegą się nie napijesz? Gardzisz?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed07=Pewien mędrzec powiedział kiedyś: „Pusty kufel to po prostu taki, który nie został powtórnie napełniony”. <SFX: pukanie w ściankę kufla><odchrząknięcie> Echem, o czym to ja?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed08=Ważne jest, aby opanować napitek i nie pozwolić, by to on zapanował nad nami.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed09=A, i jeszcze jedno! Trzeba pić dużo wody.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed10=W senniku pandareńskim jest napisane: liczne klikanie przetrzymasz, później starości dożyjesz.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed11=Dla niektórych sama podróż jest celem.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed12=Losem wędrowca jest przemierzanie świata. Przygląda się on obcym kulturom, chłonie je, a później wykorzystuje zdobytą wiedzę, aby żyć pełnią życia. A, pytasz o los Mrocznego Wędrowca? To się nie mogło dobrze skończyć.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed13=Pytać, dlaczego walczymy, to jak pytać, po co grasz w Heroes of the Storm. Chodzi o wbijanie poziomów. Proszę o kolejne pytanie.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed14=Czen Gromowar, gorzelnik. Pytaj o moje produkty i nie daj sobie wcisnąć żadnych tanich podróbek.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split00=Tak?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split01=Przybywamy na wezwanie.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split02=Zaczekajcie... Nie jest nas trochę za mało? Woda nie przyjdzie. Upiła się.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split03=Aż się palę do walki!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split04=Zaraz cię rozgromię!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split05=Można powiedzieć, że... Cierpimy na roztrojenie... Banana! <westchnienie> Może pójdziesz sprawdzić, czy cię nie ma gdzie indziej?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Resurrected00=Jestem twoim dłużnikiem.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Resurrected01=<excited exertion> Mam u ciebie dług.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive00=Okej... Nic mi nie jest! Nic mi nie jest!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive01=Auć! Będę miał siniaki!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive02=No to kto chce się napić?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec00=To lubię!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec01=Nieźle. Wcale nieźle.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec02=Z doświadczenia płynie siła.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec03=<śmiech> A to dobre!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec04=Starożytny sekret pandarenów to jest.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt00=Ruszajmy do boju!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt01=Ty tam! Pokaż, na co cię stać!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt02=Wyświadczę ci niedźwiedzią przysługę <śmiech>.

VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Purchase00=Doskonały wybór!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Trial00=A! Chcesz zobaczyć w akcji prawdziwą kung-fu pandę?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Trial01=Mądrze jest spróbować towaru przed zakupem.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Mi się nie spieszy, ja mam czas. Co nagle, to po diable.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Wyglądasz dziwnie znajomo... Nie spotkaliśmy się w Pandarii?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Gotów na kolejną rundę? Nie? Dobrze, bo pić mi się zachciało.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ojej. Gorzałka mi się grzeje... Nie znoszę tego.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used00=Gromie, Ziemio, Ogniu, wysłuchajcie mego wezwania!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used01=Żywioły przybywają na moje wezwanie.

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=Walczymy ramię w ramię, Maltaelu. Tak więc niewykluczone, że tym razem cię nie zabiję.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto00=A, a, a! Pochlebstwa to droga donikąd.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Z twoich ust płynie sama mądrość, jak zawsze, mój elokwentny przyjacielu.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=W tej chwili jesteśmy sojusznikami. Skupmy się więc na naszych prawdziwych wrogach.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_No00=Tego to na pewno nie zaszczycę odpowiedzią.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Znów razem! Nikt nas teraz nie powstrzyma!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Wzajemnie, Tyraelu.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=Tak, ja. Wiesz, nikt nie będzie miał ci za złe, jeśli nie zdołasz. Jestem po prostu o klasę lepsza.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=To chyba tak nie działa.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill00=Niech Akarat ulituje się nad tobą, bo ja nie zamierzam!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill01=Krucjata idzie po ciebie!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill02=Twoje ciało jest słabe.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill03=Może następnym razem...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill04=To twój pechowy dzień.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillAngel00=Wracaj do Nieba!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillButcher00=Duchy umarłych zostały pomszczone.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDeckard00=Przepraszam, stary przyjacielu. Mniej słów, więcej czynów.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDemon00=Nie ukryjesz się przede mną w tej krainie, demonie!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiablo00=Ile to już razy, Diablo? Zupełnie straciłam rachubę.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiabloHero00=Twój czas przeminął, bohaterze.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillImperius00=Długo na to czekałam nadęty bufonie.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillLeoric00=Wracaj do grobu, Leoryku.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillMephisto00=A wydawało mi się, że to ty miałeś być tym sprytnym.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillNephalem00=Wybacz, nefalemie.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Dosyć tego.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillTyrael00=Nadeszła era nefalemów, stary druhu.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillUther00=Paladyni. Ha!

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal00=O mały włos!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal01=Dobra robota, uzdrowicielu.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal02=Następnym razem tak nie ryzykujmy.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana00=Zbyt mało many.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana01=Brakuje mi many.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana02=Potrzeba mi więcej many.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No00=Nie.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No01=Nie mogę.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No02=Nie teraz.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Sojusznik jest w potrzebie!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Potrzebuję twojej pomocy!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Potrzebuję wsparcia!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Ruszamy na bazę wroga! Już czas!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Zaprzyjaźnijmy się z tymi najemnikami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zaatakujmy ten fort!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Zająć tę strażnicę.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Trzeba nam stanąć w obronie bazy!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Nie wolno nam poddać tego fortu!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Bronić tej strażnicy!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_KillHero00=Musimy się pozbyć tego bohatera – i to szybko.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed00=Witaj.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed01=Tak? Czego ci trzeba?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed02=Dlaczego klikasz na mnie, a nie na łupach albo wrogach? Do jakiej ja gry trafiłam?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed03=Dowcipy? Oczekujesz ode mnie opowiadania dowcipów? Cóż, no dobrze, prawdopodobnie zdołam coś wymyślić.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed04=Diablo zamknął w Pandemonium paladyna, templariusza i krzyżowca. Dał im po dwie metalowe kulki i powiedział, że wypuści tylko tego, którego sztuczka zdoła go zaskoczyć. Krzyżowiec i templariusz bardzo się starali, ale nie udało im się zrobić wrażenia na Władcy Grozy. Na koniec Diablo zajrzał do celi paladyna, a ten jedną zepsuł, a drugą zgubił. <śmiech> ... I jak?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed05=Cóż, nie wszyscy łapią nasz zakonny humor.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed06=Pewnego dnia uwolnię Zakarum od zepsucia i nasza krucjata dobiegnie końca. Ciekawe, czym się wtedy będę zajmować? Ha, na pewno gdzieś znajdzie się jakieś pradawne zło, któremu trzeba będzie przetrzepać skórę!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed07=Nexus wygląda jakoś tak... chaotycznie. Przydałoby się tu więcej słupów światła. I nawałnic światła i promieni światła z nieba.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed08=Nosząc ciężką zbroję, należy bezwzględnie pamiętać o odpowiednim wietrzeniu. W przeciwnym razie zmienimy się w chodzącą konserwę, do tego wątpliwej świeżości.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed09=O, przemożny Akaracie, pobłogosław ten korbacz, będący narzędziem Twej świętej woli, ażebyś za jego sprawą raczył roznieść mych wrogów na drobne, maleńkie, tyci-tycie kawałeczki. Ciebie prosimy.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed10=Noszę imię mojej mentorki, podobnie jak ona sama nosiła imię swojej mentorki. Pewnego dnia moja uczennica przybierze moje imię, a w jej ślady pójdzie jej uczennica. Chodzi mi o to, że wszystkie mamy tak samo na imię.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed11=Nasz zakon to taka prawdziwa Ostatnia Krucjata.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed12=Czy wiesz na czym Krzyżowcy spędzają czas, kiedy nie są zajęci Krucjatą? Na krzyżówkach!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed13=Kliknij mnie jeszcze raz, a, na Akarata, obetnę ci palec! Czy czego tam używasz do obsługi myszki.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected00=Masz moją wdzięczność.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected01=Należą ci się podziękowania.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive00=Powracam!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive01=Wracam do walki.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive02=Powinnam poszukać sobie uczennicy.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec00=Dobry wybór.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec01=Doskonale.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec02=Światłość dodaje mi sił.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec03=Tak, jak być powinno.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec04=Tak mi się zdaje.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt00=Jeśli po waszej stronie walczą jacyś prawdziwi bohaterowie, to mogą mi złożyć wizytę.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt01=Krucjata szybko by cię wykończyła.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt02=Nawet moja uczennica mogłaby cię pokonać. A jej nie mam!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/TeamKilled00=Bywało ze mną gorzej. Nie trać nadziei.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExLocked00=Witaj, przyjacielu.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Stary druh powraca.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Gift00=Szczodrość jest cnotą.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Lockin00=Krucjata wzywa.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Purchase00=Mądry wybór.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial00=Mała próba nie zaszkodzi, nieprawdaż?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial01=Chcesz dołączyć do krucjaty?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Zastanawiasz się przed podjęciem ostatecznej decyzji. To dobrze o tobie świadczy – wykazujesz się mądrością.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Niewątpliwie cechuje cię skłonność do głębokich przemyśleń.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Krucjata nas wzywa.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Bezruch ma w sobie swoiste piękno... Zniszczmy je.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate1Used00=Niech zstąpi na was gniew niebios.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used00=Wiara moją tarczą.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used01=Ani kroku dalej.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used02=Stać!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used03=Hej! Łap!

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Nie znam cię, człowieku, i wcale o tym nie marzę!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Demon00=Orkowie mają dość twoich pobratymców, demonie.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Nikt cię nie prosił o opinię, miernoto.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil00=Milcz, zaczyna się bitwa. Później się z tobą rozprawię.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil01=Będę o tym pamiętać, kiedy przyjdzie nam walczyć.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil02=Chcę walczyć z wrogami, nie z tobą. Przynajmniej na razie...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Excited00=Ha ha! Doskonale!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Akurat z tym mogę się zgodzić.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Gazlowe00=Gorąco mi i jestem zmęczona.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good00=Dobrze mieć sojuszników, którym można zaufać.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good01=Honor będzie naszą tarczą.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good02=Niech siła będzie z tobą.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Horde00=Za Hordę!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_JunkratGoblin00=Kpisz czy o drogę pytasz? Milcz, jeśli chcesz mieć wszystkie zęby.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Przypomnij mi, czego jesteś królem?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=Tomator? To ten uzurpator?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Murky00=A podobno to orkowie mówią niewyraźnie.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Negative00=Zawrzyj gębę.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_No00=Kpisz? Oczywiście, że nie.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Positive00=Miałam nadzieję na dobrą walkę!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Och, oczywiście. Hee.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Lok-narasz!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Uther00=Odpuść, człowieku. Też mnie to nie cieszy.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=No dalej, wywyższaj się. Chętnie cię wytargam za te twoje kudły.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Yrel00=Cóż za szlachetność. Zamknij się i walcz, draenei.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill00=Grzmot i jucha!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill01=To mi się podobało.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill02=Walczyłam z DUŻO lepszymi przeciwnikami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill03=I to już? Pfy.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill04=No to kto następny?!

VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=To miejsce sprawia, że Szmaragdowy Sen wygląda prawie normalnie.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Greymane00=Nie zamierzasz znaczyć swojego terytorium, prawda?

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill04=Musiało dojść aż do tego...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillDryad00=Dlaczego musimy ze sobą walczyć, siostro?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillGazlowe00=Trybiki ci poodpadały.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillGreymane00=To tylko człowiek w wilczej skórze.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillIllidan00=Nie dość światów już zniszczyłeś?

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Zająć ten obóz najemników!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zniszczyć ten paskudny fort!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Musimy zająć tę wieżę!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Trzeba bronić bazy!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Nie dopuśćcie, by nasz fort wpadł w ręce wroga!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Ta strażnica długo bez nas nie postoi.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_KillHero00=Trzeba zgładzić tego bohatera.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed00=Jestem pierwszą spośród driad.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed01=Knieja nie potrzebuje ochrony, ale ty – już tak.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed02=Co nam śmiertelnicy przemocą wzięli, siłą odbierzemy!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed03=Mój ojciec, Cenarius, ma moc. Ale to ja jestem nastawiona na efekty.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed04=Nie zrozum mnie źle – śmiertelnicy świetnie sobie radzą, mordując się nawzajem. Ale knieja potrafi to robić jeszcze lepiej.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed05=Źle się dzieje w Ogrodzie Grozy. Czego oni używają do nawożenia roślin?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed06=Driady się nie pasą. Przeżuwanie trawy uważam za czynność poniżej mojej godności.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed07=Mówiąc szczerze, wybieram tylko organiczne jedzenie. Nie dziwi to nikogo, komu pod kopytami drążą tunele gobliny.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed08=Można powiedzieć, że jestem siłą natury.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed09=„Idź się pobawić na zewnątrz. Mówili. To przecież samo zdrowie! Mówili.” Chyba nie wiedzieli, że ja tu jestem.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed10=A ja mu na to: „Nie jestem driadą, której szukasz!”.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed11=Nie ma to jak majestatyczne piękno dzikiej przyrody! Wszystkie te trujące kolce i duszące pnącza! Mogłabym się w nie wpatrywać całymi dniami!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed12=Odłożyłam trochę zielonych na czarną godzinę.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed13=Hej, to nie ja wybrałam dla siebie imię Lunara. Ojciec nazwał mnie tak na cześć mojej babki. Ach, ten mój staruszek, zawsze zapatrzony w przeszłość...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed14=Nie jestem Myluna! Tylko spróbuj tak się do mnie zwrócić, a kopnę cię przednimi kopytami! A potem tylnymi.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed15=Większość driad mówi biegle po króliczemu, jeleniemu i ptasiemu, ale ja znam również mowę węży, niedźwiedzi oraz kilka rzadkich narzeczy skorpionów.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed16=Pewnie nigdy nie zdarzyło ci się zajrzeć na imprezę u driad! Wypijamy więcej soku z księżycowych jagód niż cały Festyn Lunomroku.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed17=A teraz nauczymy się poruszać jak driady! Najpierw lewe kopytko, potem prawe kopytko, potem lewe i... i prawe.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed18=Zniszczyliście własną krainę, ale nie uda się wam zniszczyć mojej!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected00=Nieźle.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected01=Dziękuję, przyjacielu. To jeszcze nie koniec.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive00=Jestem wieczna.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive01=Życie zawsze znajdzie wyjście z sytuacji.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive02=Moja walka nie jest jeszcze skończona.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec00=Całkiem nieźle.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec01=To mi się może się przydać!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec02=Doskonale.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec03=Natura obsypuje mnie darami.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec04=Już się czuję silniejsza!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt00=Co się stało? Cierpisz może na alergie?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt01=Być może zdarzyło ci się spotkać jakieś sympatyczne driady. Ja nie należę do ich grona.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt02=Świetnie się nadajesz na kompost.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/TeamKilled00=Można nas zabić, ale zawsze powracamy!

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroBoast00=Wrogowie pożałują, że weszli nam w drogę.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroBoast01=Stalą czy kłem i pazurem... Zwyciężymy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion00=Lepiej się przygotujcie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion01=Jesteście gotowi do boju?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Zdradziłeś swój lud, Arthasie. Nie ma podlejszej zbrodni.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Baelog00=Walczyłbym do ostatniej kropli krwi, aby powrócić do domu. A ty?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Erik00=Niczego nie pragnę bardziej niż odrodzenia Gilneasu.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Kael'thas00=Quel'thalas i Gilneas nigdy nie były sojusznikami. Ale najwyraźniej musimy się nauczyć współpracy.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Nieumarli władcy... Niewiele jest istot, które darzę podobną nienawiścią.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Lunara00=Nie lękaj się, driado. W porównaniu z większością ludzi żyję w wielkiej zgodzie z naturą.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=Niełatwo przychodzi mi przyjęcie pomocy. Mimo wszystko dziękuję, arcydruidzie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Słyszałem, że w Wichrogrodzie uważa się was za szkodniki.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Sojusznicy tacy jak ty sprawiają, że rozważam walkę w pojedynkę.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Skoro już zmuszony jestem przyjąć cudzą pomoc, cieszę się, że to właśnie u twego boku przyjdzie mi walczyć.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_RehgarSW00=Co ty masz na głowie? Skórę z wilka?!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Sądzisz, że jesteśmy sojusznikami? Kiedy bitwa dobiegnie końca, zabiję i ciebie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Obaj jesteśmy królami, ale to ja prowadzę watahę.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond00=Prawdziwy Gilneanin zawsze jest gotowy.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond01=Widziałem już wiele wojen. Ta będzie dokładnie taka sama, jak poprzednie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond02=Oto, co się dzieje, kiedy tracę cierpliwość.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Ana00=Oto, co się dzieje, kiedy tracę cierpliwość.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Nie sprawdzaj mojej cierpliwości!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Wszystko, co uczyniłem, zrobiłem dla dobra Gilneasu. Ty kierowałeś się wyłącznie samolubnymi pobudkami.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Baelog00=Zamilcz, albo zobaczysz moje kły z bardzo bliska.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Miałem nadzieję zdobyć sojuszników, na których można polegać, ale wygląda na to, że muszę się zadowolić tobą.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Erik00=Jestem worgenem. To nie takie trudne! Powtarzaj za mną: WORGENEM.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Kael'thas00=To prawda, mój lud dotknęła klątwa likantropii, ale ty niemal przemieniłeś swych poddanych w demony!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Zdolności? O jakich dokładnie zdolnościach mówimy? Tych, które zaprezentowałeś, kiedy doprowadziłeś swoje królestwo do ruiny, czy może kiedy zgładzili cię właśni poddani?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Lunara00=Ach tak... Kobieta, która prawie jest sarną.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=Dziś spłacam dług, jaki zaciągnął wobec ciebie mój lud.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ha! I pomyśleć tylko, że stwór twojego pokroju może wywołać aż taki chaos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Jeśli to by zależało ode mnie, walczylibyśmy po przeciwnych stronach barykady.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=Nasze losy splatają się.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Należysz do wąskiego grona osób, którym ufam.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_RehgarSW00=Ach, Rehgar. Ork, który bardzo się stara być wilkiem.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=A być może to twój lud coś utraci.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Ty po prostu zachowujesz się jak wilk. Ja zaś naprawdę staję się wilkiem.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill00=Padnijcie przede mną na kolana!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill01=Porzuć wszelką nadzieję.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill02=Giń jak kundel, którym jesteś!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill03=To się nazywa prawdziwa gilneańska gościnność.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill04=Ekhem. Kto następny?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas00=Niech to będzie moje zadośćuczynienie, Terenasie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas_W00=Dokonałem tego, co nie udało się Terenasowi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh00=A teraz zajmę się resztą twojej zawszonej Hordy.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh_W00=Lo'Gosz nie jest tym wilkiem, o którego należy się teraz martwić.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKael'thas00=Wracaj do swojej ukochanej Słonecznej Studni.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKaelthas_W00=Ugh, przypaliłeś mi futro.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric00=Tak kończą wszyscy królowie niegodni swej korony.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric_W00=Nie martw się, Leoryku. Możesz być pewny, że zakopię twoje kości.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara00=Być może natura jednak potrzebowała ochrony przed ludźmi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara_W00=Wygląda na to, że tym razem to mnie knieja okazała przychylność.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion00=Wybacz, arcydruidzie, ale nie miałem innego wyjścia.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion_W00=Być może miałeś rację, Malfurionie. W kniei naprawdę jest niebezpiecznie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Już prawie widziałem świat w odcieniach czerwieni.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpree_W00=To ja jestem samcem alfa!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas00=Domagam się sprawiedliwości w imieniu Liama! W imieniu wszystkich Gilneańczyków!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas_W00=Nareszcie udało mi się przelać twoją skalaną krew!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther00=Byłeś bohaterem dla Przymierza. Ale nie dla Gilneasu.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther_W00=Zawsze wiedziałem, że pożyję dłużej niż ty, Utherze.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillVarian_W00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W00=To moja zwierzyna!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W01=Dzięki, że miałem o co naostrzyć pazury.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W02=Łatwa zdobycz.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W03=To niewdzięczna robota.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W04=Lubię to, co robię. I robię to naprawdę dobrze.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh00=<Hearty, good natured laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh01=<Derisive laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh02=<Vindictive laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh03=<Amused, but subdued laugh>

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal00=Chwała ci, uzdrowicielu.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal01=Jeszcze Gilneas nie zginął, póki ja żyję.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal02=Nie tracisz ducha w momencie próby. Dzięki za uzdrowienie!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W00=Mało brakowało! Dziękuję.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W01=Z paszczy porażki...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W02=Zawdzięczam ci życie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana00=Brakuje mi many.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana01=Potrzebuję więcej many.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana02=Kończy mi się mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W00=Kończy mi się mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W01=Mam mało many.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W02=Muszę zregenerować manę.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No00=Nigdy.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No01=O nie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No02=Odmawiam.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W00=Nie mogę tego zrobić.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W01=To niemożliwe.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W02=Odmawiam.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Sojusznik w potrzebie!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero_W00=Ktoś z watahy nas potrzebuje!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Potrzebuję wsparcia!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Do mnie!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W00=Atakujcie ze mną!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W01=Walczcie jako jedność!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zakończmy to! Zniszczyć ich bazę!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle_W00=Rzućcie im się do gardeł! Zniszczyć bazę wroga!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Zajmijmy ten obóz i zwiększmy liczebność naszego wojska!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc_W00=Pokażemy tym najemnikom, kto tu rządzi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Już czas zrównać z ziemią wrogi fort.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost_W00=Zburzyć ten fort!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Zdobyć tę wieżę!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower_W00=Zająć tę strażnicę!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Bronić bazy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle_W00=Odciągnąć ich od naszej bazy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Nie mogą zniszczyć naszego fortu!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost_W00=Bronić naszego terytorium!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Bronić przystępu do strażnicy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower_W00=Nie pozwólcie im zająć naszej wieży!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero00=Rozerwać wrogów na kawałeczki!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero_W00=Zabić!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed00=Tak? Wykrztuś to z siebie!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed01=Będziesz się do mnie zwracać z należną mi czcią, albo wcale!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed02=Denerwujesz mnie. Nie jestem zbyt miły, gdy się zdenerwuję.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed03=Wtrącałem ludzi do lochów za mniejsze przewinienia.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed04=Dawno temu rozkazałem wzniesienie wielkiego muru, który miał odgrodzić moją ojczyznę od reszty świata. Przypominasz mi, dlaczego to zrobiłem.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed05=Kiedy już odbijemy Gilneas, trzeba będzie zacząć odbudowę. Trzeba będzie sprawdzić, czy ekipa Nieskornych ma jakieś wolne terminy.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed06=Hm, oczywiście, że to tylko paradny miecz. Mam przecież pistolet, głupcze.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed07=Chciałem umieścić na fladze Gilneasu wilczy łeb, ale moi prawnicy ostrzegli mnie, że byłoby to naruszenie praw autorskich.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed08=Mur Szarogrzywych uniemożliwiał Gilneanom wszelki kontakt ze światem zewnętrznym. No, bo jak powszechnie wiadomo, nikt w całym Azeroth nie posiada latającego wierzchowca ani nie potrafi się przeteleportować w miejsce, którego współrzędne są mu znane.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed09=Ten pistolet został wyprodukowany w gilneańskich manufakturach. Jest najwyższego... kalibru.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed10=Za wilczym śladem podążę w zamieć...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed11=Gilneas pozostawał odgrodzony od reszty świata przez długie dwadzieścia lat. Wybaczcie więc, jeśli nie będę rozumiał w lot wszystkich odniesień kulturowych, jakimi się przerzucacie, droga młodzieży.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed12=Dziś jest pełnia? O nie! Zamienię się w potwora! Ha, żartowałem. Mogę się przemienić i wyrwać ci krtań, kiedy tylko przyjdzie mi na to ochota.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed13=Raz pewien Porzucony dobijał się do bram Gilneasu, wrzeszcząc: „Będę chuchał i dmuchał, aż rozpadnie się ten wasz mur!” Uśmialiśmy się i oblaliśmy go wrzącą smołą. A potem jeszcze trochę się pośmialiśmy.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed14=Czy wiecie, że mur broniący wstępu do Gilneasu widać aż z Wypaczonej Otchłani?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W00=Czego chcesz?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W01=Mów.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W02=<Menacing growl>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W03=Nie zastanawiaj się, co się dzieje z moim mieczem, kiedy się przemieniam. Po prostu.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W04=Ci tak zwani „taureni” nie należeli jeszcze do Hordy, kiedy wzniosłem mur wokół Gilneasu. Czy dobrze rozumiem, że są to człekokształtne krowy? „Krowoludy”? To przecież niedorzeczne!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W05=Pierwszymi worgenami były nocne elfy. Chędożeni pionierzy.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W06=Głęboko w trzewiach Czarnej Kniei worgeni zbierają się u stóp wielkiego drzewa, które łagodzi zew naszej zwierzęcej natury. To bardzo zaciszne miejsce. Ale cuchnie przeokropnie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W07=Rób tak dalej, a wkrótce będziesz wołać, że ściga cię wilk.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W08=Naprawdę chcesz ze mną drzeć koty, co?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W09=Ta szata została wykonana z najczystszej wełny. Wygląda na to, że jestem wilkiem w owczej skórze!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W10=Piekielne pchły! A, to znowu ty.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W11=Nie lękam się niczego! Z wyjątkiem wizyty u weterynarza.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W12=Mówiąc zupełnie szczerze, wolę koty.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W13=Powiadają, że jestem bardzo surowym władcą. Ale wilk musi się jakoś odnaleźć w całym tym wyścigu szczurów.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W14=Z tą klątwą jest tylko jeden poważny problem. Kiedy pada, w całym Gilneasie śmierdzi mokrym psem.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected00=Silni znowu triumfują!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected01=Zaskarbiłeś sobie moją przychylność, uzdrowicielu.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive00=Gilneas zatriumfuje.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive01=Wychodziłem cało z większych opałów.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive02=Nie zawiodę mojego ludu po raz kolejny!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec00=Naturalnie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec01=Przydatny wybór!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec02=Klątwa rośnie w siłę...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec03=Bronią prawdziwego władcy jest nieugiętość.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec04=Siła, by stanąć samotnie do walki.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W00=Dobry wybór.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W01=Mogę w tym zanurzyć kły.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W02=A jednak można nauczyć starego psa nowych sztuczek.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W03=Może i jestem w połowie bestią, ale jakże skuteczną w swoim fachu.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W04=Słyszę wycie Goldrina.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt00=Nie możesz się mierzyć z moją furią!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt01=Odstrzelę ci tę paskudną gębę.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt02=Jak śmiesz sprzeciwiać się gilneańskiemu królowi?!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W00=Wyczuwam twój strach.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W01=Jedynie głupiec chciałby rzucić wyzwanie basiorowi!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W02=Uciekaj, mały zajączku.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/TeamKilled00=Pokażcie im potęgę naszej watahy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExLocked00=Posmakujcie mojej furii!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExLocked_W00=Posmakujcie mojej furii.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ta klątwa będzie moim najgroźniejszym orężem.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExPurchased_W00=Ta klątwa jest moim orężem.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Gift00=Kiedyś drwiłem ze szczodrości, lecz dziś już doceniam jej wartość.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Gift_W00=Podarunek? Hmm, interesujące.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Lockin00=Gilneas powstanie ponownie!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Purchase00=To ja jestem przywódcą watahy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Purchase_W00=To ja jestem przywódcą watahy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Trial00=Czas oznaczyć nowy teren.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Trial01=Wątpisz w moją siłę? Przygotuj się więc na małą lekcję pokazową.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Oblężenie Gilneasu trwało przez całe lata. Jestem gotów do walki.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Wahanie jest oznaką słabości.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked_W00=Pospiesz się. Jestem gotów do walki.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked_W01=Wahanie jest oznaką słabości.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Prawdziwy przywódca musi pierwszy ruszać do walki.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Znudzony wilk jest niebezpiecznym towarzyszem.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased_W00=Prawdziwy przywódca musi pierwszy ruszać do walki.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased_W01=Znudzony wilk jest niebezpiecznym towarzyszem.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used00=Nie skryjesz się przede mną!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used01=Bez pardonu!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used02=Teraz to ty jesteś zwierzyną!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used00=Niech się rozpęta moja wściekłość!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used01=Rozerwę cię na strzępy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used02=Wyzwól w sobie bestię!

VoiceOver/JainaA/PlayerAbandon00=Ojej... Czy ktoś właśnie opuścił bitwę?
VoiceOver/JainaA/PlayerRejoin00=Bohater wrócił na pole bitwy!
VoiceOver/JainaA/Revive00=Sojusznik został ożywiony.
VoiceOver/JainaA/Revive_Observer00=Bohater został ożywiony.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Garosz. Nie mam pojęcia, co Thrall w tobie widzi.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Kael00=Kael'thas...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Kelthuzad00=Proszę, proszę. Kogóż my tu mamy? Zdrajca Kel'Thuzad we własnej osobie.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Magicuser00=Hmm... Dysponujesz pewnym talentem magicznym... Ale czy zdołasz dotrzymać mi kroku?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Medivh00=Medivh! Prorok we własnej osobie! Jestem zaszczycona, mogąc walczyć u boku tak znamienitego maga!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Hmm. Jeśli jest tu jeden murlok... To bez wątpienia w pobliżu czai się ich cała zgraja, nieprawdaż?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Och, to ty. Co za pech.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Witaj, przyjacielu! Razem zmienimy ten dziwny świat!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Sonya00=Ja ich zamrażam, ty ich wykańczasz. Odpowiada ci taki układ?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_SonyaDK00=Co ci się stało, Soniu? Czy to runiczne ostrze?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Thrall, dawno już nie walczyliśmy ramię w ramię. Zbyt dawno.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Lordzie Utherze... Tak mi przykro z powodu Arthasa. Nie byłam w stanie na niego wpłynąć.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Moja moc jest do twojej dyspozycji, wasza wysokość.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Zagara00=Zagara... Takie już mam szczęście.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroRespond00=A może spróbujemy z nimi po prostu porozmawiać? Tak tylko głośno myślę...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroRespond01=Przecież tu jestem, prawda?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroRespond02=Zrobię wszystko, co w mojej mocy.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Alexstrasza00=Mogę pomóc, królowo smoków.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Anduin00=Bardzo się zmieniłeś, Anduinie. Co ci się przytrafiło?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Niemądrze jest narażać się na gniew czarodziejki.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Jak śmiesz się do mnie zwracać! Może i wyglądasz jak Arthas, ale poza tym w niczym go nie przypominasz!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Cóż, skoro tak mówisz...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Uch. Zainwestuj w tic-taki.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=Ciekawe, co to znaczy.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=To już wszystko?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=I to się nazywa dobry pomysł!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Nie da się ukryć.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Kael00=Kael, przestań. Wiesz równie dobrze jak ja, że nigdy do tego nie dojdzie.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Kelthuzad00=Nigdy! Spotka cię marny koniec, liczu! Przymierze tego dopilnuje!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Magicuser00=Ha! Jeszcze się przekonamy, kto będzie górą.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Medivh00=Dam z siebie wszystko.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=<śmiech> Jest taki słodki! Możemy go zatrzymać?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Nie mam na to czasu.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Chodźmy! Czas rzucić się w wir walki!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Sonya00=„Dobrze cię widzieć”? Chyba spędzasz za dużo czasu w towarzystwie Uthera.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_SonyaDK00=Nie, Soniu... <pauza> Arthas zapłaci.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Miło tak dla odmiany walczyć po tej samej stronie.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=Nawet sobie nie wyobrażasz, jak nam brakowało twoich mądrych rad, Utherze.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=I takim cię właśnie pamiętam, mój królu!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_ZagaraCrypt00=Nie waż się przemawiać do mnie w ten sposób, nędzny robaku!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill00=Nikt nie będzie mnie lekceważył bezkarnie.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill01=Za Kirin Tor!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill02=To powinno zapewnić nam trochę czasu.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill03=Może ochłoń troszeczkę?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill04=Tobie już wystarczy.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillArthas00=Na Światłość... obyś odnalazł ukojenie w śmierci, Arthasie.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillDemon00=Przepadnij, ohydny demonie!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillDreadJaina00=Nigdy się do ciebie nie upodobnię!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillGarrosh00=Nie zasłużyłeś na moją litość, potworze.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillHorde00=Jaka szkoda, że nie mogliśmy po prostu się dogadać.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillJaina00=Od lat coś w objęcia chłodu mnie pcha.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillKael00=To powinno odrobinę pokrzyżować wam szyki.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillMuradin00=Muradinie, przecież wiesz, że mróz ci szkodzi.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillMurky00=Dziś na kolację zupa rybna!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillOverwatch00=Nie ma to jak niewydarzona technologia.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillRagnaros00=Ochłoń nieco, Władco Ognia.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Mam jeszcze w zanadrzu kilka naprawdę wystrzałowych sztuczek.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillThrall00=Wielka szkoda, że byłeś głuchy na głos rozsądku.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillUndead00=Wracaj z powrotem do grobu!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillVarian00=Ech. Dlaczego nikt mnie nigdy nie słucha?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillWizard00=I gdzie się podziała osławiona bezczelność Li-Ming?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Laugh00=<śmiech>
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Laugh01=<śmiech>
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Laugh02=<śmiech>
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Laugh03=<śmiech>

VoiceOver/JainaBase/LowLifeHeal01=Masz moją wdzięczność, uzdrowicielu.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/LowLifeHeal02=Zawdzięczam ci życie... Dziękuję.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/LowMana00=Zaczyna mi brakować many.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/LowMana01=Zbyt mało many.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/LowMana02=Potrzebuję do tego więcej many.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/LowMana_Evo00=Brakuje mi many.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/No00=Nie.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/No01=Co? To przecież niemożliwe.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/No02=Nie mogę tego zrobić.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Sprzymierzeniec w potrzebie!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Potrzebuję pomocy. Szybko!

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=Jestem w drodze.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=Wkrótce będę na miejscu.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_Transport01=Powinniśmy to jak najszybciej przenieść.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Dobrze, a teraz musimy je odnieść.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Powinniśmy to jak najszybciej dostarczyć.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed00=Jaki mamy plan?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed01=Ciiii... Próbuję się skoncentrować...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed02=Zawsze chciałam studiować magię. Wszystko szło tak dobrze! Dostałam się na wymarzoną uczelnię, byłam ulubienicą arcymaga... Oczywiście wtedy ci szaleni kultyści wpadli na genialny pomysł, żeby przywołać do naszego świata gigantycznego demona, który rzucił zaklęcie i roztrzaskał moje miasto na drobniuteńkie kawałeczki... No i musiałam pożegnać się z dyplomem.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed03=Avada Keda... Nie. Abra kapokus! Hokus kadabra! Motyla noga, jak leciało to zaklęcie?!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed04=(konspiracyjny szept) Psst. Czy wspominałam już, że tu jest jakoś tak... dziwnie? Może trochę przesadzam, ale mogłabym przysiąc, że jakiś czas temu przebiegał tędy krasnolud cały oblepiony słodyczami.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed05=Ojej! Pierwsze siwe włosy? Chyba mnie nie postarzają?!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed06=Ha, miło w końcu rozprostować nogi! Czuję się tak, jakbym całe lata spędziła, przesiadując w jakiejś wieży!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed07=Ile czarodziejek potrzeba do zmiany żarówki? (beat) To zależy, w co ma się zmienić...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed08=Jestem czarodziejką! I to diabelnie dobrą!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed09=Co powiesz na to: zapakuję cię w zgrabną bryłę lodu, sześć łokci na dziewięć, a gdy już zapadniesz w letarg, wrzucę tę bryłę do gnomowej kopalni i zawalę szyb. Hm?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed10=Zaczaruję twój świat, bo jestem czarodziejką!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed11=Wyjaśnijmy sobie jedną rzecz: nie zajmuję się kuglarstwem, machaniem różdżką, ani tanimi sztuczkami z królikiem w kapeluszu. Tkanie iluzji to poważna sprawa!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed12=Co proszę? Ja i... Thrall?! To przecież fizycznie niewykonalne! A poza tym wszyscy wiedzą, że kolor niebieski jest ciekawszy od zielonego.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed13=A tak w ogóle, to obaj sensowni mężczyźni, którzy w ostatnich latach zabiegali o moje względy, skończyli jako owładnięci manią wielkości psychopaci, usiłujący przejąć władzę nad światem. Taaaak... Chyba jednak poświecę się nauce.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed14=Horda i Przymierze mogą współistnieć w pokoju! To nie jakieś puste frazesy – sama byłam tego świadkiem.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed15=A tak przy okazji, skoro już przy mroźnych nawiązaniach jesteśmy, odpuść sobie, proszę. O nie, co ja narobiłam?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed16=Kiedy zginął mój brat Derek, mój ojciec poprzysiągł zmieść orków z powierzchni Azeroth... Zawsze się zastanawiałam, jaki wpływ miałaby na mnie taka wielka tragedia. Szczerze mówiąc, modlę się, żebym nigdy się o tym nie przekonała.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed_Evo00=Jaki... plan?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed_Evo01=Próbuję... skoncentrować.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Resurrected00=Jestem dozgonnie wdzięczna!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Resurrected01=Mam szczęście, że zachowujesz czujność!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd00=Zemsta jest kobietą.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd01=Może następnym razem posłuchasz głosu rozsądku.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd02=No i gotowe.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart00=Zaczynasz mi działać na nerwy.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart01=Masz spotkanie z kostuchą.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart02=Nie znoszę uciekać się do przemocy. Ale dla ciebie zrobię wyjątek.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive00=Jeżeli chcecie mnie pokonać, musicie się bardziej postarać.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive01=Pospieszmy się! Sojusznicy nas potrzebują!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive02=Dobrze. Spróbujmy jeszcze raz.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Dance00=W tańcu jestem prawdziwą czarodziejką!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Dance01=O! Ten taniec podoba mi się dużo bardziej!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Goodbye00=Niech Światłość będzie z tobą.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Goodbye01=Do rychłego zobaczenia!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Hello00=Witaj.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Thanks00=Dziękuję.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Thanks01=Dziękuję ci.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_WellPlayed00=Doskonałe zagranie.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Dobre zagranie.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec00=Mam kilka pomysłów, jak to zastosować w praktyce.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec01=Rozsądny wybór.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec02=To powinno przechylić szalę zwycięstwa na naszą stronę.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec03=Podoba mi się twój tok rozumowania.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec04=Ciekawe.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt00=Coś nie tak? Czyżbym cię przerażała?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt01=Moja magia rozerwie cię na strzępy!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt02=A gdzie się wybierasz?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt_Evo00=Czyżbym cię przerażała?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt_Evo01=Moja magia rozerwie... na strzępy.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt_Evo02=Nie ma ucieczki.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/TeamKilled00=Nie poddawajcie się! Musimy zwyciężyć!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_ExLocked00=Za Przymierze!

VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_Lockin00=Jestem tu, by pomóc.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_Purchase00=Nikt nie dorówna mojej mocy!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_Trial00=Chętnie podejmę nowe wyzwanie!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_Trial01=Mogę cię nauczyć kilku przydatnych sztuczek.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Zapewniam cię, potężniejszego maga nie znajdziesz w całym Azeroth.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Jeśli będziesz potrzebować mojej pomocy, daj mi znać.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Jeśli nie zamierzasz nic robić, to ja się chwilę pouczę...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Halo? Jest tam kto?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ultimate1Used00=Chroń mnie, żywiołaku!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ultimate1Used01=Pora na ciebie, przyjacielu.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ultimate1Used02=Powstań, sługo Neptulona!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Żywiołaku.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Attack03=Rozpoznałam cel.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Attack04=Czas na małą zemstę!
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Attack05=Załatwione.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroBoast00=Do dzieła. Zawalczmy o nasze interesy.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroQuestion_Artanis00=Artanis? To ty? Ktoś tu łykał witaminki.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroQuestion_Dehaka00=Czym ty w ogóle jesteś? Zergozaurem?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroQuestion_InfestedTychus00=Tychus?! Cholera... Co oni ci zrobili?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Jedną chwilkę. Jeden z naszych jest rybą? Komu mamy to zgłosić?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroQuestion_Negative00=No, pięknie... To ty.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroQuestion_Zeratul00=Zeratul? Hm. No dobra, może być ciekawie.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Pazury przy sobie. Mam dość zergów na resztę życia.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroRespond00=Zróbmy to.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroRespond01=(do siebie) O tak...
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroRespond02=Przeszłam DUŻO więcej. Dam sobie radę.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroResponse_Abathur00=Nie jestem twoją królową. Być może egzoszkielet utrudnia ci przyswajanie informacji, ale zapamiętaj to raz na zawsze.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroResponse_Ana00=Oczywiście...
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroResponse_Angry00=Kiedy Mengsk trafi do piachu, zajmę się tobą.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroResponse_Artanis00=Masz szczęście, że nie trafiłeś na Królową Ostrzy.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroResponse_DVa00=E... dzięki?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroResponse_Dehaka00=Niemożliwe. Na pewno zapamiętałabym takie dziwadło.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Taaa. Możesz pozawracać głowę komu innemu?

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/KillKerrigan00=Dobrze, że nie jestem na twoim miejscu.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/KillLeoric00=Masz szansę przez chwilę pobyć duchem.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/KillNova00=Mnie bardziej do twarzy w tym kostiumie.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/KillProtoss00=Baw się dobrze z Khalą, albo... cokolwiek teraz wciągasz.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/KillRaynor00=Jim! Nie! ...Nigdy bym...
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/KillSpreeEnd00=Ha! Już po wszystkim?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/KillSylvanas00=Trzeba było nie wchodzić mi w drogę.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/KillTerran00=Nigdy nie wchodź w drogę duchowi wykonującemu niebezpieczną misję.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/KillZeratul00=Zeratul.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/LowMana01=Za mało many.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/LowMana02=Mało many. Muszę się podładować.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/No00=Uroczo.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/No01=Nie ma mowy.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/No02=Taaa... NIE.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Ping_AssistHero00=Sojusznik w opałach. Trzeba mu pomóc.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Ping_AssistMe00=Halo załoga? Przydałaby mi się tu pomoc.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Ping_AssistMe01=Potrzebna mi pomoc, i to szybko.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zniszczyć bazę wroga.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Ping_AttackMerc00=A teraz zajmiemy się obozem najemników.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed00=Tu porucznik Kerrigan.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed01=Co znowu?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed02=Jak właściwie powinnam się do ciebie zwracać? „Komandorze”? „Generale”? „Wielki wodzu”?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed03=Nadal chcesz się żenić?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed04=Cieszę się, że Jim jednak pomógł mi zmierzyć się z machiną wojenną Mengska. Nie wiem, co bym bez niego zrobiła.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed05=Moje gogle? Niebrzydka rzecz, ale ma znikome zastosowanie praktyczne.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed06=Ha, od dawna nie miałam na sobie kombinezonu ducha. Kiedy dodali wszystkie te podświetlenia?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed07=Nigdy nie przepadałam za Valerianem, ale muszę przyznać... Jego jajogłowi zmajstrowali kilka całkiem przydatnych zabaweczek. Muszę przy okazji podziękować temu całemu Reigelowi.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed08=Biorąc pod uwagę, ile kasy utopili w tych skrzydłach, szarpnięcie się na wbudowane urządzenie maskujące nie zrobiłoby im większej różnicy.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed09=Przypomina mi się stary dowcip z akademii: „Jak mówimy na ducha, który nie jest niewidzialny? Zimny trup”.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed10=Nie powiem, miło jest być znowu człowiekiem, ale Blizzard naprawdę powinien się na coś wreszcie zdecydować, bo kiedyś skończę jako xel'naga, a to by było niedorzeczne.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed11=Mały stresik? Coś cię gryzie? Popatrzmy. Hmm... <pauza – czytanie w myślach> Ech, trzeba było nie pytać.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed12=Zgadzam się, robolisk to zupełnie szalony pomysł. Ale wygląda rewelacyjnie, prawda?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed13=A tak na marginesie, to nie włosy. To chitynowe rurki.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed14=JESTEM ROJEM! To znaczy... Przepraszam, niełatwo pozbyć się z mózgu połączonych procesów myślowych całej rasy obcych. BĘDZIEMY EWOLUOWAĆ. PRZETRWAMY! Ech, to chwilę potrwa.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Resurrected00=Ja... żyję? Dzięki. Naprawdę.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Resurrected01=W porządku, wróciłam.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Revive00=To bolało… i to bardzo. Nie próbujmy tego znowu, dobra?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Revive01=Nie mamy czasu do stracenia!
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Revive02=Twój ruch...
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Revive03=Wracajmy do akcji.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Spec00=Brzmi nieźle.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Spec01=Odebrałam instrukcje.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Spec02=Ulepszenia? Ależ proszę bardzo.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Taunt00=Czytam ci w myślach, wiesz?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Taunt01=Pokaż, co potrafisz!
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Taunt02=Noszę skrzydła nie tylko dla ozdoby.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/TeamKilled00=W tej chwili naprawdę przydałaby mi się zergowa zdolność do regeneracji.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_Trial00=Uruchamiam diagnostykę. Co co, rozpętamy im prawdziwe piekło?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_Trial01=Test sprawnościowy, co? Jak za starych, dobrych czasów.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_WaitLocked00=Co ty na to, żebyśmy przetestowali te skrzydła?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_WaitLocked01=Twój ruch...
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_WaitPurchased00=Brr. Myślałam, że strój ochronny wykonany jest z psionicznie reaktywnych nanowłókien będzie cieplejszy.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_WaitPurchased01=Zaczynam się nudzić.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Ultimate1Used00=Popatrz, znalazłam ci kolegę.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Healed00=Dobrze. Służ mi dalej, a nie ominie cię nagroda.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Healed01=Przydatna zdolność... Możesz odejść.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Healed02=Dobrze uzdrawiasz, mój oddany sługo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree00=Oczekuję, że spełnisz swoje przyrzeczenie...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree01=Gniew będzie twoim najpotężniejszym sojusznikiem.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree02=Tym razem nikt nas nie powstrzyma.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroBoast00=Podbiłem tysiąc światów. Z tym nie będzie inaczej.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroBoast01=Ciemna strona mocy przyniesie zgubę naszym wrogom.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion00=Przed nami wojna. Obyśmy byli gotowi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion01=Ja jestem gotów. A ty?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Czuję, że ledwo panujesz nad ciemnością. Nie jesteś jej godzien.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Wyczuwam w tobie ciemność, demonie. Niklejszą niż u innych, ale to wystarczy, żebyś mi służył.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Ciekawe. Stoisz przed Władcą Ciemności, ale nie okazujesz strachu.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Hmm. Widzę w tobie walkę ciemności ze światłem... Nikt nie może wiecznie służyć dwóm siłom.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Istota stworzona z czystej ciemności. Przysięgnij wierność Wiecznemu Imperium, a pozwolę ci żyć.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Twoja moc będzie służyć Wiecznemu Imperium. Nieważne, czy dobrowolnie, czy pod przymusem.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Monk00=Człowiecze, nie czuję w tobie nic poza spokojem. Śmiertelnym spokojem. Jak to się dzieje, że jeszcze żyjesz?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Wyczuwam w tobie wielki gniew. Dołącz do mnie, a pomogę ci dopełnić zemsty.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Nie kłopocz się. Podbijałem już całe światy sam...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Mam wrażenie, że możesz mi się przydać. Obym się nie mylił, dla dobra nas obu.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Istota światłości... Wieczne Imperium walczyło już z takimi jak ty. Dla mnie jesteś przekąską.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond00=Niepokoi mnie twój brak wiary.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond01=Pytanie, czy ty też?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond02=Pilnuj swoich spraw.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Ana00=Przydasz mi się, więc na razie wybaczę ci tę impertynencję.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Ach, toż to król, któremu wydaje się, że ma władzę nad zmarłymi... Wiele wskazuje, że jest dokładnie odwrotnie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Wkrótce się przekonasz.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Nikt mnie tak nie nazwał od czasu, gdy... Powiedz tak raz jeszcze, a pożałujesz.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Żyjesz tylko dlatego, że na to pozwalam. Nie nadużywaj mojej łaski.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Demon00=Przydasz mi się, więc na razie wybaczę ci tę impertynencję.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Nie tym tonem. Mówisz jak wielu innych, których już nie ma na tym świecie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Monk00=Nie jestem tym, za kogo mnie uważasz, człowiecze. Ciesz się, że jeszcze mnie nie poznałeś.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Murky00=Jeśli właśnie tego chcesz, nie będę tłumił twego gniewu.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Negative00=Dość.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Positive00=Oszczędźmy sobie kurtuazji... Jest wiele do zrobienia.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Tak, istoto światłości... Ulegnij przerażeniu i pozwól, by ogarnęła cię ciemność.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill00=To było aż za proste.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill01=Chyba ci życie niemiłe.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill02=Imperium nie toleruje zdrajców.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill03=Próżny trud.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill04=Marny koniec.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillArthas00=Otacza cię śmierć, ale nie masz nad nią władzy.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillAzmodan00=Czemu się opierasz, demonie? Przecież chcemy tego samego.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillBarbarian00=A gdzie twoja zbroja?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillButcher00=Ależ gniew... Ależ nienawiść. Musisz mi służyć, bestio.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillCrusader00=Jak na mój gust za dużo mówisz.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDemonHunter00=Może i władasz ciemnością, ale na pewno cię nie zrodziła.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDiablo00=Wiecznemu Imperium przydałaby się twoja moc, Diablo. Dołącz do mnie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillMonk00=Módl się do kogo chcesz. Nie ma bogów, którzy by cię przede mną uratowali.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillSpreeEnd00=W żaden sposób mi nie dorównasz.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillTyrael00=Interesujące. Jesteś aniołem? Czy tylko istotą światłości, która go udaje?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillUther00=Niechaj sczezną wszyscy, którzy dzierżą światło.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWitchDoctor00=Igrasz z mocami, o których nie masz pojęcia.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWizard00=Nie jesteś nią... ale mimo to twoja śmierć mnie zadowala.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal00=Wyśmienicie. Wracają mi siły.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal01=Ach, udało się oddalić widmo mojej śmierci.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal02=Tym razem było trochę za blisko.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana00=Kończy mi się mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana01=Brakuje mi na to many.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana02=Potrzebuję many.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No00=To niemożliwe.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No01=Nie zmuszaj mnie, bym cię zniszczył.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No02=Nigdy.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistHero00=Nasz sojusznik traci siły.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe00=Za mną.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe01=Do mnie, szybko!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zniszczyć bazę wroga!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackMerc00=„Zmotywujcie” tych najemników, żeby do nas dołączyli.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Strzaskać ich umocnienia.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackTower00=Przydałaby się nam ta strażnica.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendCastle00=Bronić naszej bazy!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Nie pozwólcie, aby ten fort upadł.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendTower00=Bronić tej strażnicy.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_KillHero00=Pokażcie temu bohaterowi moc ciemności.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed00=Czego chcesz?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed01=Nie wystawiaj mej cierpliwości na próbę. To nierozsądne.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed02=Moje Wieczne Imperium pochłonęło tak wiele światów. Im bardziej zaciskam pięść… tym więcej czerpię z nich mocy.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed03=Zmiażdżyliśmy niemal wszystkich wrogów… Wszystkich prócz jednego. Dlaczego te Gwiezdne Księżniczki są tak oporne? Czyżby chodziło o jakąś szczególną moc?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed04=Skoro już się poznaliśmy, możesz mi mówić po imieniu - czyli „Lordzie Hełmofonie”.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed05=Nie wierzcie w żadne "przebudzenie mocy". To slogan firm produkujących bateryjki zasilające mechaniczne króliczki.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed06=Ciemności nie wolno lekceważyć, bo jak się zaweźmie, to zacznie dzwonić z nieznanego numeru i sapać do słuchawki!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed07=Jeżeli kiedyś postanowisz zbudować gigantyczną stację kosmiczną, nie oszczędzaj na kontroli jakości. Nawet niewielki element może przyczynić się do katastrofy.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed08=Wiesz, dlaczego noszę maskę? Cóż… podobno wyglądam na lorda, tylko nie ta morda...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed09=Owszem, symbolem mocy ciemności jest ten świetlisty hologram. Hmm… i co z tego?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed10=Aaach! Ten wizjer ciągle zachodzi parą. No, już lepiej.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed11=Niektórzy twierdzą, że nazwa Wieczne Imperium jest pretensjonalna. To znaczy... twierdzili. W czasie przeszłym. Gramatyka jest tu bardzo istotna.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed12=Pytasz o te światełka przy mym mechanicznym pancerzu? To... dekoracje, ale mogą złowrogo migać.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed13=Buława świetlna to fenomenalna broń. Czego nie można odciąć, można po prostu zmiażdżyć.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed14=Baterie w pancerzu wystarczają na 12 godzin czuwania, 3 godziny rozmów międzygalaktycznych lub 15 minut złowrogiej latarki.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed15=Kosmos… ostateczna granica… granica mojej cierpliwości wobec tych wszystkich jełopów we wszechświecie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected00=Bezkresna posługa. Wieczna lojalność.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected01=Dobra robota, sługo Imperium.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive00=Krąg się zamyka… ponownie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive01=Jestem wieczny – tak jak nasze imperium.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive02=Doskonale. Inkwizycja trwa!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive03=Nie tak łatwo mnie pokonać.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive04=Śmierć po mnie nie przyjdzie. Życie już dawno mnie opuściło.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec00=Ciemność rośnie w siłę.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec01=Teraz nasi wrogowie dowiedzą się, co to znaczy cierpienie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec02=Hmm. Idealnie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec03=Nie rozczarowujesz mnie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec04=Dobrze. Przyda się.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt00=Jeśli nie jesteś ze mną, jesteś moim wrogiem!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt01=Tylko podejdź, to skończysz marnie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt02=Sam się z tobą rozprawię.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/TeamKilled00=Nieeee!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExLocked00=Kto zakłóca mój spokój? Oby to było coś ważnego!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExPurchased00=O, czuję znajomą obecność...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Gift00=Jak sobie życzysz.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Lockin00=Tę galaktykę czeka straszliwy los.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Purchase00=Chwała Wiecznemu Imperium.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial00=Aaa, nowy świat do podbicia!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial01=Chcesz zobaczyć prawdziwą moc? Pozwól, że ci pokażę.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked00=Dołącz do mnie, a rzucimy na kolana całą galaktykę!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked01=Moja cierpliwość ma swoje granice.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased00=Wiedz, że kiedy ciebie znuży wyczekiwanie, ja wciąż będę niewzruszony.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased01=Tyle gwiazd... Każda z nich w końcu będzie moja.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used00=Nikt nie uniknie swego przeznaczenia.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used01=Ha! Teraz jesteś mój.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used02=Na tej arenie dopełni się twój los.

VoiceOver/LiLi/KillSpreeEnd00=Ha! Jestem najfajniejszą pandarenką w tej krainie!
VoiceOver/LiLi/KillStitches00=Uuu, jak truposz mógł się tak roztyć?

VoiceOver/LiLi/LowLifeHeal02=Dzięki! Naprawdę tego potrzebowałam!
VoiceOver/LiLi/LowMana00=Mam trochę mało many!
VoiceOver/LiLi/LowMana01=Do tego potrzeba więcej many.
VoiceOver/LiLi/LowMana02=Ale poważnie, brakuje mi many.
VoiceOver/LiLi/No00=Nie. Nawet mowy nie ma.
VoiceOver/LiLi/No01=To jest totalnie niemożliwe.

VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed01=Hej, coś ci się nie podoba?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed02=Mój wujaszek czasem zabiera mnie na wycieczki w naprawdę dziwne miejsca... Gdzie my w ogóle jesteśmy?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed03=Widzieliście kiedyś Gromowe Urwiska? Taureni zbudowali tam miasto na takim wielkim płaskowyżu. I mieszkają w namiotach! Hmm, zawsze się zastanawiałam, gdzie oni chodzą... No, wiecie...
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed04=Pamiętaj, żeby uważać z leczniczym wywarem. Znałam kiedyś takiego jednego, co wpadł do kociołka z eliksirem, jak był mały. Potem wyrosły mu wąsy i taaaaaakie brzuszysko.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed05=Wiesz co? Najfajniejsze w wycieczkach po Nexusie jest to, że co dwadzieścia minut mogę zwiedzać kolejny świat!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed06=No więc tak... Urodziłam się na wyspie, która tak naprawdę jest skorupą olbrzymiego żółwia, który pływa po oceanie... Ale co, jeśli ocean jest – no wiesz – po prostu skorupą drugiego, jeszcze bardziej ogromniastego żółwia? A jeśli... A jeśli, jeśli tych żółwi jest więcej?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed07=A wiesz czemu śpię na ziemi? Bo mam klapnięte uszko!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed08=Ktoś jeszcze się zastanawia, skąd się biorą ci mali, dziwni stronnicy? Hmm? Nawet się nie przywitają! Halo? Hej! Cześć! Jestem LiLi, a wy?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed09=Hej, powiedz, szturchasz tak wszystkich swoich znajomych? Bo to by było napraaaawdę dziwne.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed10=Jestem sobie mały miś, śmieszny miś…
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed11=Życie jest jedną wielką przygodą! Hm, no chyba, że nie jest... Ale w takim razie nie za bardzo wiem, czym w końcu jest... Hmm... nowelą?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed12=Heeej, a my nie powinniśmy przypadkiem walczyć? Fajnie się gada i w ogóle, ale drużyna na nas czeka, wiesz?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed13=Nie chcieliście nigdy odłożyć broni i wyruszyć w wielką podróż? Cały świat czeka na odkrycie!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Resurrected00=Wow, dzięki! Nie lubię wąchać kwiatków od spodu.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Resurrected01=Moja prywatna brygada ratunkowa! Dzięki!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Revive00=Ale się porobiło... Straszne z nich oprychy.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Revive01=Jaki palant bije małe dziewczynki?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Revive02=Hej, daj mi chwilkę... Muszę dojść do siebie.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Spec00=Ale czad!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Spec01=Teraz mi nie podskoczą!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Spec02=Ale wypas!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Spec03=Uuu, rewelka!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Spec04=Ooo, tego jeszcze nie próbowałam!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Taunt00=Wow... ale z ciebie tępa dzida!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Taunt01=Ej, dziwadło! Nie ty... to drugie... Tak w sumie... to wszyscy jesteście dziwni.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Taunt02=Naprawdę ci się wydaje, że pokonasz kogoś z Gromowarów?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Taunt03=Pffffft.
VoiceOver/LiLi/TeamKilled00=No i po zawodach…

VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_WaitLocked00=Uuu, a co tu tak błyska?
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_WaitLocked01=Widzę cię!
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_WaitPurchased00=Hej! Jesteś tam jeszcze?

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Atakować bazę wroga!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Zajmijmy obóz najemników.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Musimy zająć się tym fortem.

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed00=Potrzebujesz pomocy specjalistki?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed01=Proszę określić naturę problemu medycznego.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed02=Wstąpiłam do DZZ, żeby dzięki mnie wszechświat stał się bezpieczniejszym miejscem dla mojej rodziny. Nigdy nie przypuszczałam, ze skończę tutaj.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed03=Kiedy wracam myślami do Ziemi, zdaję sobie sprawę, że tęsknię za tyloma rzeczami... Nawet za robalami. Wyobraź sobie, że na Ziemi są znacznie mniejsze.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed04=O nie, zaczyna się szturchanie! Szybko, wymyśl jakąś ciętą ripostę... Cholera, jestem sanitariuszką, nie jestem komediantką!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed05=Kiedy ktoś mnie o to pyta, zawsze odpowiadam, że łatwo jest leczyć. To trochę jak zabijanie, tylko na odwrót.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed06=Zawsze najpierw strzelają do sanitariusza... I właśnie dlatego mam na wyposażeniu tę supernowoczesną, regenerującą życie osłonę!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed07=Hej, czy strzelanie do sanitariuszy nie jest przypadkiem zbrodnią wojenną? Czy konwencje genewskie obowiązują w Nexusie?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed08=Kiedy już podasz neurostymulanty młodej Nadświadomości, wszystko inne pójdzie jak z płatka... Możesz mi wierzyć.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed09=Gdy człowiek usłyszy hasło „Co jest, doktorku?” o jeden raz za dużo, zaczyna poważnie rozważać popełnienie na delikwencie błędu w sztuce!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed10=Osobiście nie cierpię igieł. Ale wbijanie igieł w innych? To już sama radość.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed11=Jak mówi stara lekarska maksyma: po pierwsze nie szkodzić. Jeśli to nie zadziała, zawsze możesz użyć granatów.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed12=Czerwone z czerwonym, żółte z żółtym, białe z białym. Tak zszyj, a na pewno będzie dobrze.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed13=O, muszę przyznać, że niezły jest ten nowy sprzęt... Ale jak to? A gdzie flara optyczna? Nie ukrywam, że idea granatnika mi się podoba, ale będzie mi brakowało oślepiania wrogów!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed14=Hm, co to za nalepka? „Uwaga: niniejszy emiter wiązki leczącej nie posiada rekomendacji terrańskiego funduszu zdrowia. Po użyciu nie zaleca się pracy z ciężkim sprzętem oraz mitycznymi stworzeniami”. O!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed15=Działania niepożądane obejmują nudności, przemieszczenie międzywymiarowe, podrażnienie ścian żołądka oraz pomroczność jasną. Przed użyciem zapoznaj się z treścią ulotki dołączonej do opakowania emitera wiązki leczącej bądź skonsultuj się z lekarzem lub farmaceutą, gdyż każdy lek niewłaściwie stosowany zagraża twojemu życiu lub zdrowiu.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed16=No i co tak szturchasz? Bo się nudzisz? Innym rękę urywa, i już tak nie szturchają!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Resurrected00=Och, jeszcze chwila, a poszłabym w kierunku światła!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Resurrected01=Dziękuję. Nie wiem, co bym bez ciebie zrobiła.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive00=Puls... miarowy. Parametry życiowe... w normie.

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec04=O, to mi się podoba!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt00=Lepiej się przyjrzyj, bo to maksimum moich możliwości.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt01=Och, myślisz, że macie z nami jakieś szanse? Ha, pomyśl jeszcze raz!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt02=Skarbie, zdrapywałam z rękawiczek żołnierzy lepszych od ciebie.

VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Uff, ta osłona jest diablo ciężka.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Co minutę ginie setka ludzi. Poważnie zastanów się nad marnowaniem czasu.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used00=Podaję nanostymulanty.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used01=To powinno pomóc.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Czy nie ma dla ciebie spoczynku, Szalony Królu?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Cóż to za stwór? Czy przybywasz może z dalekiego Skovos?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Hm... Najwyraźniej bogowie postanowili dziś sprawdzić moją cierpliwość...
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Bogowie się do mnie uśmiechają za twoją sprawą.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroRespond00=Urodziłem się gotów.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroRespond01=Nie obawiaj się. Zakończę to szybko.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroRespond02=Wypróbujmy nasze siły w konfrontacji z wrogiem.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=Zaprowadzimy powszechny ład.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Lepiej nic nie mów, jeśli zamierzasz jedynie pleść brednie.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Pokonamy ich bez względu na wszystko.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Najlepiej będzie, jeśli zachowamy milczenie.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=<prycha pogardliwie>
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=Bogowie i boginie lasu to dziwne istoty.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Karanie śmiercią pozostawiam tobie.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Zachwycające! Twoja mowa przypomina bulgoczącą kipiel płynącej rzeki.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Nie zaszczycę cię moją uwagą.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_No00=Twoja tyrada mnie nuży.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ta kraina potrzebuje wojowników naszego pokroju.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Kill00=Nie jestem pod wrażeniem.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Kill01=Twoje umiejętności nie są imponujące.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Kill02=Tutaj kończy się twoja droga.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Kill03=Żałosne.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Kill04=Z łatwością pokonałem nawet najlepszych.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillAzmodan00=Zamilcz, demonie!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillButcher00=Wracaj do Piekieł, potworze.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillChen00=Żaden z ciebie mnich.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillD3Hero00=Nawet tych, którzy są nam najbliżsi, może dosięgnąć spaczenie.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillDiablo00=Groza nie może zwyciężyć w tej krainie.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillLeoric00=Może tym razem już nie powstaniesz z martwych?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillSpreeEnd00=To twój koniec.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillTyrael00=Niestety, przyjacielu. Zakłóciłeś równowagę.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowLifeHeal01=Moje rany się zasklepiają.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowLifeHeal02=Masz moją wdzięczność, uzdrowicielu.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowMana00=Brakuje mi many.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowMana01=Potrzeba mi więcej many.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowMana02=Potrzebuję many.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/No00=Nie da się tego zrobić.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/No01=Prosisz o rzecz niemożliwą.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/No02=Zastanów się.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Sojusznik potrzebuje naszej pomocy.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Sam sobie nie poradzę!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Połączmy siły!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zniszczyć bazę wroga!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Zawładnijmy tym obozem najemników.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zrównać ten fort z ziemią.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Zniszczyć tę wieżę.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Musimy bronić bazy!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Bronić naszego fortu!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Ruszajcie. Trzeba bronić wieży!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_KillHero00=Przeznaczeniem tego wroga jest śmierć.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed00=Dokąd wiedzie twoja droga?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed01=Służę patriarchom z Iwogrodu, namaszczonym przez tysiąc i jednego bogów.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed02=Nie dowierzałem, że moja droga zawiedzie mnie w to miejsce, ale tak właśnie się stało.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed03=Pierwej zadumaj się nad swoim czynem. Dzięki temu będzie powodować tobą mądrość... A przynajmniej taką mam nadzieję.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed04=Zdarzyło mi się przemierzyć niezliczone krainy i poznać rzesze ludzi. Mądrość jest pośród nich zjawiskiem tak rzadkim, jak klejnot ukryty na górskim szczycie.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed05=Razu pewnego zdarzyło mi się podróżować w towarzystwie wojownika o czystym sercu, który wierzył jedynie w kłamstwa, bogini, która nie wierzyła w bogów, oraz sędziwego mędrca, który plótł jedynie bzdury.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed06=Swój pierwszy oddech wciągnąłem w płuca pod znakiem Ytara, boga słońca. Przywdziałem jego szaty i podążam za jego słowem.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed07=Rad jestem, że nie przyszedłem na świat pod znakiem pomniejszego boga. Istnieją bóstwa lenistwa i niezdarności, a grono ich wiernych sług jest doprawdy liczne.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed08=Jeśli już musisz wiedzieć, nie wyłysiałem. Golę włosy by zachować czystość.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed09=Zdarzyło mi się przebić pięścią niezliczone deski i pościć przez wiele dni... Lecz tatuaże na mojej twarzy nadal pozostają najbardziej bolesnym doświadczeniem mojego życia.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed10=Moje serce jest niewzruszone. Mój duch czysty. A moje mantry... przydatne.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed11=Używając techniki Eksplodującej Dłoni, należy pamiętać o jednym: dłoń nie powinna tak naprawdę eksplodować.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed12=Oczyść swój umysł. Bądź płynny, bezkształtny – jak ogień. Jeśli umieścisz płomień w pucharze, przepali on i puchar, i stół, i nawet cały dom. Bądź płomieniem – nie zaś pucharem.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed13=Najwyraźniej służysz Sovyatowi – bogu niekończącego się szturchania. Twój patron musi być bardzo, bardzo dumny.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed14=To dziwne że większość nefalemów, którzy znaleźli się w tej krainie, to niewiasty. To dziwne, lecz wspaniałe.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed15=Gdy ja dołożę, wtedy nie daj boże, nawet sam Ytar ci nie pomoże.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected00=Wypełniasz wolę bogów.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected01=Nasz trud jeszcze nie dobiegł końca.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive00=Bogowie nakazują mi walczyć dalej!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive01=Nie wybiła jeszcze moja godzina.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive02=Powstaję, by służyć raz jeszcze.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec00=Rozumiem coraz więcej.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec01=Droga przede mną jest wyraźniejsza.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec02=Bogowie się do mnie uśmiechają.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec03=Ytar mnie wywyższył.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec04=Mój umysł rośnie w siłę.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt00=Tak bardzo chcesz zginąć?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt01=Zmierzysz się ze mną - i przegrasz.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt02=Swoją słabością obrażasz bogów.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/TeamKilled00=To tylko kolejna próba. Sprostamy jej.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExLocked00=Jestem pięścią bogów.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Będę walczył o zachowanie równowagi.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Gift00=Mam misję do wykonania. Powinienem ruszać.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Lockin00=Ytarze, poprowadź mnie.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Purchase00=Bogowie obdarzyli cię mądrością.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial00=Wyzwanie? Znakomicie.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial01=Ach! Pozwól, że pokażę ci kilka ciosów.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Ci, którzy nie robią nic, obracają się w nicość.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Czas nie stoi w miejscu. Ja też nie powinienem.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Nie można zwyciężyć bez ryzyka.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Bogowie nie nagradzają bezczynności.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used00=Bogowie prowadzą mą dłoń!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used01=Poczuj gniew Ytara!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate2Used00=Tysiąc i jedno błogosławieństwo.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate2Used01=Bogowie dają ci siłę.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes02=Za chwałę Iwogrodu.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes03=Tak.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes06=Mój umysł jest czysty.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes07=Bogowie są obecni we wszelkim stworzeniu.

VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion00=No to jak? Chcecie rozłupać parę czerepów?
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion01=Mam nadzieję, że jesteście gotowi.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Trzymaj ten przeklęty miecz z dala ode mnie.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Falstad00=Stawiam dwa mieszki złota, że zatłukę ich więcej niż ty.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Ohyda! Nie znoszę tych oślizgłych beboków!
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Nie wierzę, że muszę walczyć ramię w ramię z tobą.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Positive00=No, no, no. Patrzajta, kto nas zaszczycił swoją obecnością.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Viking00=Hej, chłopaki! Widzieliście kiedyś prawdziwe Pustkowia?

VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroRespond02=Urodziłem się gotów!
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Agree00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Zawiodłem cię, chłopcze, i za to cię przepraszam.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Falstad00=Na moją brodę... Pewnie, że tak!
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Murky00=Na sam dźwięk tego durdlania gęsiej skórki dostaję.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Negative00=No, drałuj, zanim zapomnę, po której stronie walczysz.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Positive00=Rozwalmy parę czerepów, co?
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Viking00=Synku, nie jestem wi…kingiem. Ale znam taką jedną Kingę, co miała niezłą klingę. Hehe!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Kill00=Znam elfy twardsze od ciebie!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Kill01=Następnym razem uważaj, gdzie leziesz!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Kill02=Następny zewłok nakarmi robaczki.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Kill03=Przekaż uszanowanko przodkom!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Kill04=Dawnom się tak nie ubawił!
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillArthas00=A to za zostawienie mnie w tej cholernej jaskini!
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillDemonHunter00=I ty niby na demony polujesz?
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillFalstad00=Krasnoludy ze wzgórz... Mocne w gębie, ale młoty malutkie.
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillRaynor00=Hahaha! Szeryf od siedmiu boleści!
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillSpreeEnd00=A mówili, że z was twarde sztuki!
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillTassadar00=Wychodzi na to że Tassadar nas… zawiódł.
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillThrall00=Ależ wodzu, co wódz! Hehe!
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillTinker00=Tej kupie złomu przydałby się przegląd!

VoiceOver/Muradin/LowLifeHeal00=Uff, tego mi było trzeba.
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowLifeHeal01=Ha! Rad jestem, że walczysz po mojej stronie.
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowLifeHeal02=Kiepsko to wyglądało. Dzięki!
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowMana00=Brakuje mi many.
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowMana01=Many zaczyna mi brakować.
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowMana02=Przydałoby mi się trochę many!
VoiceOver/Muradin/No00=Coś nie sądzę.
VoiceOver/Muradin/No01=Niemożliwe.
VoiceOver/Muradin/No02=Nie dam rady.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AssistHero00=Trza pomóc sojusznikowi!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AssistMe00=Hej! Pomóż mi no tu!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AssistMe01=Przydałby się tu jeszcze jeden topór!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AttackCastle00=Kto ma ochotę zniszczyć bazę wroga?
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AttackMerc00=Trzeba zająć ten obóz najemników.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Rozwalmy ten fort!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AttackTower00=Zająć tę strażnicę!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_DefendCastle00=Bronić bazy!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Szybko! Bronić fortu!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_DefendTower00=Po mojemu nie zaszkodziłoby bronić tej strażnicy.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_KillHero00=Czas poczęstować kogoś młotem!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed00=Zamieniam się w słuch.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed01=Dobrze cię widzieć!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed02=Kto nie z mieczem, tego zmieciem.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed03=Nie umarłem – tak se tylko leżałem.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed04=Nie szturchaj krasnoludzkiego wojownika, bo wojownik może szturchnąć ciebie!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed05=Chesz wiedzieć, jak to jest z tą amnezją? No więc... zapomniałem.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed06=Opowiedzieć ci kawał? Tak, z brodą...
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed07=Krasnoludem się nie rzuca! No chyba, że krasnolud pozwoli.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed08=Wiesz, co robi krasnolud, kiedy kufel jest pusty? Wyżyma brodę! Hahahaha!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed09=Można wyrugować króla z serca gór, ale góry z serca króla – nigdy.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed10=Mój jedyny problem to pusty kufel.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed11=Gadają, że mój dziadunio tak naprawdę był... Sinobrody. Biedaczek, całe życie musiał się farbować! Ale ciii.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed12=O nie! Blizzard ukatrupił twoją ulubioną postać? Nie frasuj się – całkiem prawdopodobne, że sprowadzą ją z powrotem w następnym dodatku. Coś o tym wiem, no nie?
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed13=To straszna tragedia i w ogóle, ale sami wiecie... Gustowny posąg z tego mojego brata. Cały się błyszczy i w ogóle...
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed14=Kiedy Brann był jeszcze małym fajflem, lubił se podbierać magazyn Gildii Podróżników… Mówił, że ciekawie piszą, ale wszyscy wiedzieli, że chodzi mu o gołe tuskarrki. <śmiech>
VoiceOver/Muradin/Resurrected00=Dzięki, że masz na mnie oko.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Resurrected01=Uff, nawet nie zdążyłem zauważyć, co mnie dopadło.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Revive00=Na brodę dziadunia, było blisko!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Revive01=Za Khaz Modan!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Revive02=A już prawie trafiłem do wielkiej kuźni w obłokach!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Spec00=Dobrze!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Spec01=To mi pasuje!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Spec02=Świetny wybór.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Spec03=Od dawna chciałem to wypróbować!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Spec04=Teraz już nikt mi nie podskoczy!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Taunt00=Cho no tu i przywitaj się z moim młotem!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Taunt01=Walcz jak prawdziwy krasnolud!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Taunt02=Podejdź no, to ci buźkę przefasonuję!
VoiceOver/Muradin/TeamKilled00=Czas na kolejkę! Kto stawia?
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_ExLocked00=Co mogę dla ciebie wytegować?
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_ExPurchased00=Dobrze cię widzieć!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_Gift00=No nic. Sam się odprowadzę…
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_Lockin00=Gotów do akcji!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_Purchase00=Bierzmy się do roboty!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_Trial00=No i to mi się podoba!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_Trial01=Doczekać się nie mogę!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_WaitLocked00=Na co czekamy? Rozłupmy parę czaszek!

VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed02=No i jak się podobają moje nowe młoty? Miażdżą, prawda?
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed03=Mechaniczna broda na pancerzu? Niebrzydka rzecz. W końcu sam ją zamówiłem! Ale już nie pamiętam, czy ma jakieś zastosowanie praktyczne!
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed04=A może kufelek... napalmu? (SFX) Ech, mogę na tym jechać cały dzień!
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed05=Chcieli mi dać młot rakietowy, ale powiedziałem im, że mają źle w głowie! Żeby dzierżyć taki oręż, trza przecież być olbrzymem! Dużo rozsądniej jest wystrzelić rakietę niż ściskać ją w garści, co nie?
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed06=Dobra baza wroga to płaska baza wroga.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed07=Ostatni raz powtarzam: nie jestem żaden Rory Swann! <pauza> To mój kuzyn!

VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed09=Rozerwijmy się! – jak powiedziała bomba do zamachowca.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed10=Plecak odrzutowy to świetny dodatek do tego pancerza! Szkoda tylko, że nie da się z nim wskakiwać na klify...
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed11=A, teraz już pamiętam, po co kazałem zamontować tę brodę! <SFX> To lodówka turystyczna!
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed12=Podczas ostatniej misji mój pluton został wysłany na czerwonego karła. Okazało się, że znam gościa! Biedak nigdy się nie smarował kremem z filtrem.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed13=A może odpalimy jakąś muzyczkę? Zawsze jestem w nastroju na metal.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed14=I kto wymyślił tę pukawkę z bagnetem? Niedorzeczne! To by się nigdy nie sprawdziło w prawdziwej walce! Jedną chwilunię, muszę przeładować granatnik w moim młocie.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Resurrected00=Sanitariusz pierwsza klasa!
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Resurrected01=Wracam do gry!

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Dismissive00=Och, to ty... A wszystko układało się doskonale.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Dryad00=Hm, wyczuwam wokół ciebie aurę naturalnej magii. Ciekawe...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=<Do not record. Reuses introboast.>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Na Płonące Piekła, cóż to za istota?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Spróbuj nie zginąć. Nie chciałbym wskrzeszać twojego szkieletu.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Dobrze. Potężny sojusznik.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Archanioł Tyrael! Rad jestem, że nie ustajesz w walce o zachowanie Równowagi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Wizard00=Uważaj na siebie... Tobie podobnym znawcom magii nie raz zdarzyło się już zachwiać Równowagę.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond00=Staję twarzą w twarz ze śmiercią jak ze starą przyjaciółką.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond01=Nigdy nie podawaj w wątpliwość moich możliwości.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond02=Tak jest.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Drwisz z kapłana Rathmy na własne ryzyko.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Ach, tak... To rzeczywiście wyjaśnia twoją obecność tutaj. Bardzo dobrze.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Uroczo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Tylko z twojej perspektywy.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Hm... A więc legendy o nefalemach są prawdziwe. To będzie interesujące doświadczenie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Nigdy nie bratałem się z demonami – i nie zamierzam tego teraz zmieniać.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Wiem... Wielka szkoda, że ty nie możesz. A może zapomniałeś, jak było ostatnim razem?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Zachowaj swój jad dla kogoś, komu zależy na twojej opinii.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=Bez przesady... Śmierć była tutaj przez cały czas.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Taaak... Doceniam twoją niezwykłą dojrzałość.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ten dźwięk mrozi krew w żyłach.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Czyny, nie słowa.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Pójdźmy. Będziemy ramię w ramię walczyć o zachowanie Równowagi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Tyraelu... Tak się cieszę, że udało ci się przeżyć zniszczenie Kamienia Świata.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Wizard00=Poznałaś mojego ucznia? A to ci niespodzianka.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill00=Po prostu kolejny trup.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill01=Poznaj swoją śmierć.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill02=Nigdy nie podawaj w wątpliwość moich umiejętności.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill03=Trzeba się bardziej postarać, żeby mnie zatrzymać.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill04=W imię Równowagi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill05=Ha! Podniosłem twoje ucho!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillArthas00=Smarkacz przebrany za władcę śmierci.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillAzmodan00=Phi. Duriel był trudniejszym przeciwnikiem. A przecież to tylko przerośnięty robal.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillD3Hero00=A nie jestem nawet nefalemem.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDeath00=No cóż, o jednego tak zwanego władcę śmierci mniej w Nexusie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDemon00=Równowaga będzie zachowana, demonie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDiablo00=Diablo, znowu padasz u moich stóp!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillLeoric00=Nie potrzebuję nieumarłych, którzy nie są mi posłuszni.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillMephisto00=Szerokiej drogi, Mefisto! Przekaż moje pozdrowienia otchłani.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Moc śmierci jest na moje rozkazy.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillTyrael00=Przykro mi, aniele, ale ci, którzy naruszają Równowagę, ponoszą konsekwencje swoich czynów.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillUndead00=Cóż za marnotrawstwo nieumarłej tkanki.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillWitchDoctor00=To umarli mają nam służyć, szamanie – nigdy odwrotnie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillZeratul00=Zeratulu, czy mogę cię zainteresować ofertą pośmiertnej służby?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh01=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh02=<hearty laugh>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh03=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh04=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh05=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh06=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh07=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh08=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ach, to dużo lepsze niż te obrzydliwe mikstury. Dostawałem od nich zgagi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal01=Topią się lodowe okowy śmierci.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal02=Doskonała robota, uzdrowicielu. Doprawdy doskonała.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana00=Potrzebuję... many.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana01=Za mało many.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana02=Szkoda, że nie mam przy sobie mikstury many.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No00=Ha! Nie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No01=Nie mogę.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No02=Niemożliwe.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No03=Ehh. Niby dlaczego?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Nasz sojusznik jest w niebezpieczeństwie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Potrzebuję pomocy.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Potrzebuję wsparcia!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zakończmy to! Zniszczyć ich bazę!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Zająć ten obóz najemników.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zniszczyć ten fort.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Musimy ruszyć na tę strażnicę.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Bronić naszej bazy!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Bronić fortu.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Nie pozwólcie im zająć tej strażnicy!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_KillHero00=Śmierć wzywa tego bohatera.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed00=O co chodzi?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed01=Czy musisz przerywać mą zadumę?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed02=Hm? Ach, tak, ja też dopiero przyzwyczajam się do kosy, ale muszę przyznać... Ta idea zaczyna mi się podobać.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed03=Tylko dwóch rzeczy nie da się w życiu uniknąć: śmierci i... Hm... Wiesz, nie mogę sobie przypomnieć drugiej. Nieważne więc, niech będzie „śmierci” i „śmierci”.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed04=No, no, no... Ze śmiercią ci do twarzy.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed05=Nam, kapłanom Rathmy, powierzono podtrzymywanie Równowagi, ale chyba nie wszyscy rozumieją, czym ona jest.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed06=Wyobraź sobie Równowagę jako sieć... Niewidzialną siatkę bezpieczeństwa, która ochrania nic nieznaczące, rumiane ptysie twojego pokroju przed runięciem w bezdenną otchłań. Moim zadaniem jest podtrzymywanie tej sieci. Czekam na wyrazy uznania.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed07=Przywódca nekromantów znany jest jako Mówca Umarłych. Kto zgadnie, o czym najchętniej ucina sobie pogawędki?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed08=Za moich czasów nikt by nie uwierzył, że nefalemowie istnieją naprawdę. A jednak... Oto oni. Cała szóstka. To już lekka przesada, nieprawdaż?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed09=Sądzisz, że ta gra jest trudna? Ha! Nie grasz nawet w w trybie hardkorowym!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed10=Co człowiek sieje, to i żąć będzie... A ja sieję śmierć.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed11=Tak, zdarza mi się wskrzeszać zmarłych, ale nie jest to przyjemny widok.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed12=Ostatni raz powtarzam: nekromanta i nekrofil to nie to samo!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed13=Kiedyś będę się musiał zastanowić, co począć z tymi wszystkimi uszami, które zebrałem. Może zrobię sobie z nich pas albo coś w tym guście.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed14=Cśś! Czen mnie poprosił o pomoc w seansie spirytystycznym. A teraz potrzebuję się wyciszyć. I całe otoczenie też.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed15=Zachowywanie równowagi nie jest łatwym zadaniem. Czasem trzeba kogoś znerfić.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected00=Powracam... lecz nie jako ożywiony trup? Musisz mnie tego nauczyć.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected01=Prawdziwe wskrzeszenie? Taki wyczyn powinien być niemożliwy...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive00=...A więc tak wygląda śmierć? Już do niej tęsknię.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive01=Wielki krąg istnienia obraca się ponownie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive02=Najwyraźniej moja misja nie dobiegła jeszcze końca.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive03=Hm? I nie trzeba biec do zwłok? To mi się podoba!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec00=Interesujące...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec01=Doskonały wybór.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec02=Tak być musi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec03=Rozsądna z ciebie istota...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec04=Ach, również zastanawiałem się nad tym wyborem.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt00=Ty... Idziesz na randkę ze śmiercią.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt01=Słusznie się mnie lękasz, ale nic ci z tego nie przyjdzie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt02=Wyczuwam w tobie... życie. Pozwól, że cię od niego uwolnię.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/TeamKilled00=Nie pozwólcie, by śmierć was pokonała. Czerpcie z niej siłę i dokonajcie zemsty.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExLocked00=Śmierć jest na moje rozkazy.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExPurchased00=O, znajoma twarz.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Gift00=Twoja hojność nie pozostaje niezauważona.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Lockin00=Już czas.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Purchase00=Wracam do akcji.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial00=No i to mi się podoba.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial01=Czeka nas mały trening, jak mniemam?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Ruszamy?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Nie daj się prosić – poddaj próbie moje umiejętności! Nie mogę się doczekać, aż wrócę na pole bitwy.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Brr. Powinienem był założyć koszulę.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hm. Za moich czasów Battle.net wyglądał zupełnie inaczej.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used00=Nova trucizny!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used01=Zgnilizna!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used02=Cuchnące tchnienie umarłych.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used03=Toksyczna esencja.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used00=Poczuj chłód śmierci.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used01=Śmierć wyciąga po ciebie ręce.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used02=Powstańcie, aby mi służyć!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used03=Zwolnijmy na chwilę tempo.

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Kogo my tu mamy? Jego Wysokość król Karmobylec we własnej osobie? Mam nadzieję, że nie zmiękłeś przez wszystkie te lata życia w luksusie.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroRespond00=Od lat nie miałem godnego przeciwnika.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroRespond01=Znowu wracam na arenę.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroRespond02=Duchy poprowadzą nas po zwycięstwo!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Cóż. Przynajmniej nie można ci odmówić woli walki...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Tak. A teraz się z tym pogódź albo stul pysk. Wybieraj.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=No chodź, musimy wygrać tę bitwę... Za Hordę!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=To ja jestem zaszczycony, wodzu.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Czas zmienia wszystko. Nie jestem tu żadnym wyjątkiem.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill00=Ha! Nadal coś potrafię!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill01=Nie wstawaj. Tak będzie łatwiej.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill02=Jeśli ktoś na ciebie postawił, to właśnie przegrał.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill03=Musisz się jeszcze DUŻO nauczyć.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill04=Nie mów, że nie stać cię na więcej.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillBarbarian00=Nareszcie godny przeciwnik!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillHuman00=No... Z czym do orków, mięczaku.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillMalfurion00=Ech... wszyscy druidzi wyglądają tak samo.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillMarine00=Szkoda dobrego pancerza...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Kolejna seria zwycięstw dobiegła końca.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillThrall00=To był dla mnie zaszczyt, wodzu.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillVarian00=Ha! Próbuj dalej, panie Karmobylec.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillZerg00=Zdeterminowany, niebezpieczny... Takich przeciwników lubię!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowLifeHeal00=Niewiele brakowało... Dzięki.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowLifeHeal01=No... jednak na coś się przydajesz.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowLifeHeal02=Zawdzięczam ci życie.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowMana00=Mam mało many.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowMana01=Grr... Za mało many.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowMana02=Potrzebuję do tego więcej many.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/No00=Nie.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/No01=Chyba kpisz.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/No02=Nie zawracaj mi głowy.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Swój potrzebuje pomocy.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Chodź no tu który i mi pomóż.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Sam nie dam rady.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zniszczyć bazę wroga!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Ci najemnicy będą dla nas walczyć albo zginą!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Trzeba zniszczyć ten fort!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Zająć tę strażnicę!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Bronić naszej bazy! Za wszelką cenę!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Bronić tego fortu! Ale już!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Musimy bronić tej strażnicy.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_KillHero00=Wyprosić mi tego gieroja z areny.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed00=No co?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed01=Czego ode mnie chcesz?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed02=Moja przeszłość przypomina historię większości orków. Jest pełna przemocy i walki o wolność. Może kiedyś ci ją opowiem.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed03=Lok’tar... ogarnij się!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed04=Przestań... Bo jak ja cię kliknę...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed05=Moim zwierzęcym totemem jest wilk. Co, nie widać?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed06=My śmiertelnicy jesteśmy jedynie cieniami i pyłem...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed07=Muln Furia Ziemi? Ten stary byk? Ktokolwiek twierdzi, że jesteśmy spokrewnieni, ten kłamie. Chociaż... moja prababcia w sumie BYŁA głupią krową...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed08=Wiesz... Chodzę na rajdy od lat, a nadal nie zdobyłem hełmu do tego zestawu.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed09=W dawnych czasach tylko szamani znali tajniki budowy totemów. A potem pojawiły się sklepy z pamiątkami...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed10=Chcesz sprawdzić, co lubią szamać szamani?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed11=Bleh... co tu tak śmierdzi mokrym psem?... Ach, no tak.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed12=Generalnie... Ekhem... Admiralnie rzecz biorąc, nie ma nic bardziej niszczycielskiego niż „Grom”, „Burza” i „Błyskawica”.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed13=Piorun! Grom! <efekt dźwiękowy: grzmot> <efekt dźwiękowy: kwik przerażonej świni> Chyba trochę przesadziłem.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed14=Czasem lubię sobie potańczyć z wilkami.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed15=Dobra, niech będzie - jak przestaniesz to odpalę ci procent od wygranych.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed16=Te całe gry wideo to w sumie fajna sprawa, będę musiał częściej do nich zaglądać.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed17=Nie klikaj w miejscu, bo wilka dostaniesz.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Resurrected00=Wracam do walki!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Resurrected01=Dzięki za przywrócenie do życia.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Revive00=Duchy wzywają mnie do boju!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Revive01=Raz jeszcze ruszajmy w bój!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Revive02=Ech... za każdym razem trochę boli.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec00=Moja moc rośnie!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec01=To powinno wyrównać szanse.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec02=Podoba mi się twój tok rozumowania.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec03=Tego się nie spodziewają.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec04=Niech pobłogosławią mnie przodkowie.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt00=Zakład, że wygram?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt01=Naprawdę myślisz, że ze mną wygrasz?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt02=Kolejna łajza. Oszczędź mi zachodu i skocz z jakiegoś urwiska.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/TeamKilled00=Skupcie się. Jeszcze damy radę ich pokonać.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_ExLocked00=Mok’ra!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Niechaj przodkowie mają cię w swej opiece.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Gift00=Świeża krew? Miejmy nadzieję, że potrafisz walczyć.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Lockin00=Będę walczyć do ostatniej kropli krwi!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Purchase00=Wracamy na arenę!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Trial00=Patrz na starego Rehgara... może się czegoś nauczysz.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Trial01=Patrz uważnie, bo nie będę powtarzał.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Zrób coś, bo umieram z nudów.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Ech... nie znoszę siedzieć na trybunach.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Nie wiem, jak Thrall może znieść taką bezczynność.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Wiesz... a moglibyśmy teraz walczyć.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate1Used00=Wszechmocna potęga Hordy!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate1Used01=Poczuj, jak w żyłach płynie gniew!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate2Used00=Niechaj przodkowie mają cię w swej opiece.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate2Used01=Duchy cię ocalą!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate2Used02=Uleczenie.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate2Used03=Nie dam ci zginąć!

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/VoiceLineThree00=Gratulacje. Udało ci się mnie zdenerwować.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/VoiceLineTwo00=Nie mówił ci ojciec, że nie wkurza się orków?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/WorthIt00=Ha! Wydawało ci się, że możesz mnie pokonać?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/WorthIt01=Uwielbiam, kiedy wszystko idzie zgodnie z planem.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes00=Wichrze, prowadź mnie!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes01=Dabu.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes02=Hmm. Węszę strach.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes03=Lok-regar!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes04=Ha. Może być.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes05=Jasne jak słońce.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes06=Natychmiast.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes07=Niech będzie.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes08=Ruszajmy.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Attack00=Wrogowie są osłabieni! Zlikwidować ich!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Attack01=Atakujcie, póki nasz wróg jest słaby!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Attack02=Do ataku!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Caution00=Uważaj, zbliża się niebezpieczeństwo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_GoodJob00=Wspaniała śmierć.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_GoodJob01=Ha! Dobra robota!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_GoodJob02=Razem dobrze nam idzie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Heal00=Twoje rany są głębokie. Ulecz się.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Heal01=Co robisz? Idź się uleczyć!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Retreat00=Muszę się wycofać.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Retreat01=Muszę się uleczyć.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Uhoh00=Hmm. Nie wyszło.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Uhoh01=Ech.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Uhoh02=<disgusted exertion> Nie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Attack00=Na szpony i pazury!

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroAgree00=Szykuje się wspaniała zabawa.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroAgree01=Hmm... zgoda.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroAgree02=Służę toporem.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroBoast00=Polujmy razem, a nikt nas nie pokona.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroBoast01=Niech rozpoczną się łowy!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion00=Zaczynamy łowy?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion01=Lepiej się przygotuj...
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Pamiętaj, kto jest twoim prawdziwym wrogiem, demonie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Chen00=Witaj, Czenie! Siła i honor, stary gorzelniku.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_DemonHunter00=Dobrze cię widzieć, łowczyni!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Gazlowe00=Gazolu. Jesteś gotów do walki?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Hearthstone00=<Reuses introboast01>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Lok’tar ogar!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Proudmoore... Minęło sporo czasu, odkąd... wiesz...
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Nie zapuściłeś się aby czasem za daleko od domu?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Hm. To ty.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=O, dobrze znowu cię widzieć.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Samuro00=Mistrzu Ostrzy... Dawno się nie widzieliśmy.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Wodzu, jestem zaszczycony.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroRespond00=Oczywiście.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroRespond01=Hm. Chodź, Misza.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroRespond02=Świadczą o mnie moje czyny.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Milcz, albo nakarmię tobą niedźwiedzia!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Demon moim sojusznikiem... Dziwny jest ten świat.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Chen00=Zaiste, Czenie. Chodź, zapolujmy jeszcze raz.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_DemonHunter00=No, nareszcie ktoś, kto się zna na łowach.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=He. Rób co chcesz.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Gazlowe00=Kilka lat błąkałem się po Mrocznym Pustkowiu. A poza tym nie mam powodów do narzekań.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=Za Hordę!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Hmm, skupmy się na czekającej nas bitwie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hm, ten sprawia wrażenie walecznego. Ciekawostka.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Właśnie dlatego wolę towarzystwo dzikich bestii.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=O. To znowu ty.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Zwykle wolę towarzystwo dzikich bestii, ale dla ciebie mogę zrobić wyjątek.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Samuro00=Cieszę się, że widzę cię w dobrym zdrowiu, bracie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Wodzu... Cieszę się, że znów staniemy do walki ramię w ramię.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Tired00=Ech, mam już tego dosyć.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill00=To się nie mogło inaczej skończyć.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill01=Dobra walka.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill02=Ha! Prosto w pysk!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill03=Nakarmię swoje bestie twoimi szczątkami.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill04=Misza, nie jedz tego ścierwa!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillButcher00=Rzeźnik pokrojony na kotlety. Pysznie!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillChen00=Dobrze, że się starasz, Czenie. Ale to nie wystarczy.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillChogall00=Takie lebiegi jak ty psują ogrom opinię.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillDemonHunter00=Jak na łowczynię zbyt często stajesz się zwierzyną.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillHorde00=Spoczywaj w pokoju, bohaterze Hordy.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillJaina00=Hm. Zabijanie Proudmoore’ów chyba wchodzi mi w krew.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillSpreeEnd00=I wszystko jasne.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillThrall00=Wybacz, Wodzu.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh00=<śmiech>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh01=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh02=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh03=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh04=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh05=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowLifeHeal00=Mało brakowało. Dziękuję ci.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowLifeHeal01=Mmm. Wielkie dzięki.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowLifeHeal02=Znacznie lepiej.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana00=Kończy mi się mana.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana01=Mam za mało many.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana02=Za mało many.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel00=Misza, do mnie!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel01=Misza, do nogi!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel02=Tutaj, Misza!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel03=Misza, chodź tu!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge00=Bierz ich!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge01=Misza, rozerwij ich na strzępy!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge02=Biegaj naprzód!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge03=Naprzód, Misza!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel00=Misza, do mnie!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel01=Tutaj, Misza!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel02=Misza, chodź tu.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel03=Misza, do nogi.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel04=Misza, tutaj.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel05=Tutaj, Misza.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel06=Misza, do mnie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No00=Nie mogę tego uczynić.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No01=To niewykonalne.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No02=Nie mogę tego zrobić.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Nasz sojusznik potrzebuje pomocy.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Potrzebuję pomocy.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Wojownicy, do mnie! Szybko!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zniszczyć ich bazę.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Pozyskajmy tych najemników.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zaatakujmy ten fort.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Mądrze byłoby zająć tę strażnicę.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Szybko, do obrony bazy!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Musimy bronić tego fortu.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Bronić tej strażnicy!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_KillHero00=Zabijmy tego bohatera.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed00=Jestem na tropie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed01=Zwierzyna jest blisko.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed02=Kiedyś spytałem ojca, kim była moja matka. Odpowiedział: „Synu, ciesz się, że nie masz dwóch głów, taka impreza była”.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed03=Teraz rozumiesz, dlaczego opuściłem ojca i dołączyłem do Hordy?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed04=Nie gonię w piętkę. Po prostu chciałbym wiedzieć, skąd na świecie tyle baranów.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed05=Pogoda pod psem, psi żywot, na psa urok... Ludzie mają dziwne podejście do swoich „najlepszych przyjaciół”.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed06=Jakby potrząsnąć moim drzewem genealogicznym, spadłby niejeden ogr... ale raczej z gałęzi matki.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed07=W gardle mnie drapie... Koń by się uśmiał. <rżenie konia> Z byka spadłeś?! <ryk wściekłego byka> Nie małpuj po mnie! <skrzek małpy> Co za osioł! <ryczenie osła>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed08=Z nagraniami zawsze są jaja... <pohukiwanie sowy>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed09=Miałem kiedyś jamnika, który wabił się Terror i dostawał furii na hasło „murlok”.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed10=Kiedyś spotkałem pewnego poszukiwacza przygód. Trafiłem go strzałą w kolano... i już nie jest poszukiwaczem przygód.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed11=<SFX: Muzyka z Hearthstone w tle> Ej! Nie graj w dwie gry na raz!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed12=<SFX: Unleash the Boars plays> To mój ulubiony moment. <SFX: Attack sounds start playing>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed13=Tak w ogóle, to kto mnie wrobił w ten łuk? Przecież ja miałem dwa topory!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed14=Historia poszła do przodu, a ja nadal chodzę w zbroi z symbolami Hordy.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Resurrected00=Dzięki, dalej poradzę sobie sam.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Resurrected01=W samą porę.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive00=Wróciły mi siły.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive01=Czuję zew dziczy.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive02=Łowy rozpoczęte!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec00=To mi wystarczy.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec01=Sprytnie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec02=Mądry wybór.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec03=Bardzo dobrze.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec04=Lok’tar ogar!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt00=Nie uciekniesz przede mną!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt01=Nie ukryjesz się. Znajdę cię wszędzie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt02=Stawaj do walki!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/TeamKilled00=Nie daj w sobie złamać ducha walki. Właśnie tego chcą.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_ExLocked00=Siła i honor.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Thrall hall!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Gift00=Mój dom jest tam, gdzie się położę.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Lockin00=Czuję zew dziczy.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed02=Zrób to raz jeszcze, a zostaniesz z kikutem.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed03=Czas leci jak strzały. Ciało leci jak ścierwo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed04=Szybkość jest przydatna, lecz celność jest zabójcza.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed07=Umrzyj i pozwól nie żyć.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed08=Zaraz przekonasz się, że gniew Króla Licza to nic przy gniewie Królowej Banshee.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed09=Nie, nie zaśpiewam ci. Jestem pozbawioną serca władczynią nieumarłych, a nie katarynką.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed11=Słuchaj, byłam już wysokim elfem, elfem-banshee, nieumarłym wysokim elfem, ale nigdy nocnym elfem. Nie szlajam się po nocach.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed12=Nie, nigdy nie byłam Nocnym Łowcą... ale za to mam własny, nieumarły girl-band o nazwie Band-she.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Forsaken00=Będziecie mi służyć.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Zabiłabym cię, ale ciekawiej będzie zobaczyć twoje upokorzenie.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_GennGreymane00=Zginiesz w cierpieniach, tak jak twój syn.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Kaelthas00=Ha. Ja przynajmniej objęłam tron!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=Nie! I macie przestać pić przed walką.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Murky00=Chyba nie mówisz poważnie.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Negative00=Trzymaj język za zębami, bo go wyrwę.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillArthas00=Przekaż moje pozdrowienia bezkresnej ciemności...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillBloodElf00=Shorel'aran, sindorei.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillKaelthas00=Jesteś słaby, podobnie jak twój ojciec...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillKerrigan00=Na polu walki jest miejsce tylko dla jednej królowej. A ty jesteś zwykłym pionkiem.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillSkeletonKing00=Ja przewodzę nieumarłym!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillSpreeEnd00=Nigdy nie przestanę walczyć. Nigdy.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillStitches00=Żadna zmora nie ucieknie przed moim gniewem!

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowLifeHeal00=Wyrazy uznania dla ciebie.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowLifeHeal01=Uratowana!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowLifeHeal02=Dobrze mi służysz.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowMana00=Kończy mi się mana.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowMana01=Potrzeba mi więcej many.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowMana02=Mam zbyt mało many.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/No00=Nie sądzę.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/No01=Nie.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/No02=Odmawiam.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AssistHero00=Chyba pora wspomóc naszego sojusznika.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AssistMe00=Potrzebne mi wsparcie!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AssistMe01=Natychmiast do mnie!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackCastle00=Atakujcie tam, gdzie zaboli ich najbardziej... na bazę!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackMerc00=Musimy „zwerbować” tych najemników.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zrównać ten fort z ziemią!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackTower00=Zająć tę strażnicę!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendCastle00=Przepadniemy, jeśli nasza baza upadnie. Bronić jej!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Macie strzec naszego fortu, nawet za cenę swojego żałosnego życia!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendTower00=Słuchać moich rozkazów: chronić tę wieżę.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_KillHero00=Zabić tego pseudo-bohatera!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed00=Kimże jesteśmy jak nie niewolnikami tej udręki?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed01=Myśmy Porzuconymi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed02=Zrób to raz jeszcze, a zostaniesz z kikutem.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed03=Czas leci jak strzały. Ciało leci jak ścierwo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed04=Szybkość jest przydatna, lecz celność jest zabójcza.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed05=Nawet nie masz pojęcia, jak trudno robić to wszystko w szpilkach. Dobrze, że mi nerwy pogniły i nic nie czuję.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed06=Nie mam czasu na gierki, a zawsze biorę w nich udział... Hm...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed07=Umrzyj i pozwól nie żyć.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed08=Zaraz przekonasz się, że gniew Króla Licza to nic przy gniewie Królowej Banshee.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed09=Nie, nie zaśpiewam ci. Jestem pozbawioną serca władczynią nieumarłych, a nie katarynką.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed10=Sądziłam, że tylko ja zostałam zamordowana przez okrutnika, wskrzeszona jako potężny, lecz straszliwy potwór, po czym sama obwieściłam się królową i poświęciłam swoje sługi dla własnej zemsty. Ale wówczas poznałam Kerrigan!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed11=Słuchaj, byłam już wysokim elfem, elfem-banshee, nieumarłym wysokim elfem, ale nigdy nocnym elfem. Nie szlajam się po nocach.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed12=Nie, nigdy nie byłam Nocnym Łowcą... ale za to mam własny, nieumarły girl-band o nazwie Band-she.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed13=Ktoś jeszcze słyszy to bzyczenie?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed14=Entliczek, pętliczek, pójdziesz na stryczek...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed15=Uch! Co to za smród? To ja nadal gniję?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Response_CastingQ00=<upiorne szepty>
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Response_CastingQ01=<Short Breaths>
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Response_CastingQ02=<Short Breaths>
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Response_CastingQ03=Melorn!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Response_CastingQ04=Fallah na!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Response_CastingQ05=Talah!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Resurrected00=Ciemność jeszcze mnie nie ogarnęła...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Resurrected01=Czy to była moja val'kyria?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Revive00=Cóż za przekleństwo! Jaka w tym radość?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Revive01=Nie ma dla mnie spoczynku.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Revive02=Nie mam czasu na gierki.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec00=To wystarczy.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec01=Interesujące.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec02=Bardzo dobrze.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec03=Dobra.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec04=Zwycięstwo jest blisko.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt01=Znieważ mnie za życia, a będziesz służyć mi po śmierci.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt02=Właśnie szukałam celu... i oto jesteś.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/TeamKilled00=Nie lękajcie się. Przeżyłam już gorsze sytuacje.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_ExLocked00=Stań do walki ze mną lub padnij przede mną.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_ExPurchased00=Mroczna Pani ma cię w opiece.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Gift00=Jakże... szlachetnie.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Lockin00=Zwycięstwo Porzuconym.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Purchase00=Rozsądna z ciebie istota.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Trial00=Czy nie dość prób już przeszłam?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Trial01=Igrasz z potęgą, której nie jesteś w stanie pojąć.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitLocked00=Streszczajże się.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitLocked01=Uwolnij mnie!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitPurchased00=Nie mam w zwyczaju na nikogo czekać.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitPurchased01=Moja cierpliwość się kończy.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate1Used00=Niech me oko będzie zawsze celne.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate1Used01=Pora przechylić szale zwycięstwa!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used00=Należysz do mnie.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used01=Słuchaj Królowej Banshee.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used02=Słuchaj i służ.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used03=Co za wątły umysł.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used04=Chodź, sługo.

VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed01=Czego sobie życzysz?
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed02=Nie mam czasu na granie... No, dobra. Jeszcze jedna partyjka przed snem.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed03=Orki mogą mi pozazdrościć naramienników.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed04=Nie wiem, jak smakuje śmierć. A skoro nie mam ust... raczej się nie dowiem.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed05=Musimy wezwać pomoc! Egzekutorze, wystawcie rozpruwacze.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed06=Jak to poszły „na demobil”?! To poślijmy dragony!
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed07=Dobrze, to co robimy? A co to jest „promień otchłani”?
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed08=Jak sobie przypomniałem pierwszego StarCrafta, łzy wzruszenia zalały mi oczy i piksele się rozmyły...
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed09=Z mroczną mocą templariuszy uważać musisz. Jeśli raz spróbujesz, powrotu nie odnajdziesz.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed10=Właściwie... żałuję, że nie puściłem Mar Sary z dymem.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed11=En Taro... Ja!
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed12=Patrzcie, zergi! Król StarCrafta, szczęka jak złamana... Rapuję, choć ust nie mam... En Taro na-na-na-na!
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed13=Nie wiem, czy wiesz, ale moce psioniczne nie są „kosmiczną magią”. To tak, jakby nazwać Kerrigan larwą.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed14=Chociaż w sumie... to straszna larwa. Strach pomyśleć, co jeszcze może się z niej wykluć.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Resurrected00=Wróciłem.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Resurrected01=Doceniam twoją pomoc.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Revive00=Khala jest wieczna.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Revive01=Khala’dor-ah.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Revive02=Niechaj światło sprawiedliwości rozbłyśnie raz jeszcze.

VoiceOver/Tassadar/Spec02=Za’thun kalinar.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Spec03=Racja.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Spec04=Niewątpliwie.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Taunt00=Śmierć wrogom pierworodnych!
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Taunt01=Jak śmiesz mi się przeciwstawiać?!
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Taunt02=Drżyjcie przed potęgą Khali!
VoiceOver/Tassadar/TeamKilled00=Teraz mogę w spokoju oddać się medytacji.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_ExLocked00=Witaj, niezwykła istoto.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_ExPurchased00=Bądź pozdrowiony, egzekutorze!

VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_Trial00=Mały krok prowadzi do wielkich czynów.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_Trial01=Przez trudy do gwiazd.

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal02=Dusza powraca do mego ciała.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana00=Mam niewiele many.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana01=Potrzebuję więcej many.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana02=Kończy mi się mana.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No00=To niemożliwe.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No01=Nie.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No02=Nie marnuj mojego czasu.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Sojusznik jest w potrzebie.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Pomóżcie, natychmiast!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Potrzebuję wsparcia.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zniszczyć ich bazę! Lok’tar!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Warto by zdobyć pomoc tych najemników.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Wojownicy, szturmujcie fort!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Zajmijmy tę strażnicę.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Brońmy naszej bazy!

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_KillHero00=Zgładzić tego bohatera! Szybko!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed00=Jestem wodzem Hordy!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed01=Duchy niespokojne. Potargały sad. A my się bijemy, ładnych parę lat.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed02=Dostałeś kiedyś piorunem tam, gdzie słońce nie dochodzi?!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed03=<wzdycha> Brakuje mi strategii czasu rzeczywistego. To były czasy...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed04=Ten rzut izometryczny... Ten rozmach bitew...!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed05=Ale szturchania mi nie brakuje. Wychowali mnie ludzie, ale to nie znaczy, że jestem głupcem i nie potrafię zrozumieć pierwszego kliknięcia.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed06=Jak znalazłem się w okopach na Nexusie? To bardzo proste: jestem żonaty, lubię spokój, więc zgłosiłem się na ochotnika.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed07=Dajcie mi wodza, a ja już znajdę dla niego wojnę.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed08=Jestem jedynym orkiem, któremu udało się strollować Hordę.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed09=Posłuchaj rady wodza. Nie rób głupot tylko dlatego, że ktoś zacznie ryczeć „Za Hordę”.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed10=Chciałbym oficjalnie zaprzeczyć plotkom dotyczącym mojego pochodzenia. Mój ród to „Klan Mroźnego Wilka”, a nie żaden „Dom Hamera”.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed11=Zobaczmy, jakie dali mi zdolności... Łańcuch Błyskawic... może być. Dziki Duch... nieźle. Furia Wichru... Ha, przykro mi Rehgarze... Tym razem to ja jestem debeściak.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed12=Żył raz szaman orków, który... lubił podczas burzy tańczyć. Kiedyś piorun go popieścił... i go trzeba niańczyć.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed13=W razie kolejnej wojny z Przymierzem postawię na czele Hordy goblina i wykończymy ich ekonomicznie.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed14=Zaraz, zaraz. To ta gra ma fabułę? Naprawdę zapłaciliście komuś, żeby napisał historię spotkania Raynora i Diablo? Od wymyślania takich rzeczy są fani! <Westchnienie> Mogło być gorzej. To mógł być romans.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Resurrected00=Dziękuję.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Resurrected01=Dobrze, że tu jesteś.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive00=Jeszcze Horda nie zginęła!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive01=Lok’tar ogar!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive02=Niech pobłogosławią mnie przodkowie.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec00=Ha. Dobry wybór.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec01=W sam raz.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec02=Przepełnia mnie moc.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec03=Duchy patrzą na mnie łaskawie.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec04=Zaiste, już czuję się silniejszy.

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt01=Jestem gniewem Hordy!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt02=Zmierz się z synem Durotana!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/TeamKilled00=Nie zniszczycie naszego ducha walki.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_ExLocked00=Lok’tar.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Czego sobie życzysz?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Gift00=Twój sojusznik to mój sojusznik.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Lockin00=Chwała Hordzie!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Purchase00=Za Hordę!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Trial00=Dobrze. Niech no ci pokażę, jak to się robi.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Trial01=Patrz uważnie, bo powtarzać nie będę.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Pokażę ci prawdziwą potęgę żywiołów.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Nie zwlekajmy. Trzeba stoczyć wojnę.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=A cóż innego możesz mieć do roboty?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Jestem wodzem Hordy, bezczynność mi nie przystoi!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used00=Poczuj gniew Zgładziciela!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used01=Dość tego!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used02=Unicestwią cię żywioły!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used03=Dosyć tego!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used00=Niechaj ziemia pochłonie moich wrogów!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used01=Drżyjcie z przerażenia!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used02=Nawet ziemia walczy po mojej stronie!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used03=Potęga Hordy!

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_GoodJob01=Dobrze ci to wyszło!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_GoodJob02=Ha! Fantastycznie!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_Heal00=Ulecz się... odzyskaj siły.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_Heal01=Marsz do studni leczenia... To rozkaz!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_MercCapture00=Ci najemnicy będą nam dobrze służyć.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_OnMyWay00=Przyda ci się pomoc.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_OnMyWay01=Nadciągam z odsieczą.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_Retreat00=Muszę się uleczyć...
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_Retreat01=Wrócę, jak tylko będę mógł.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_Uhoh00=Nie!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_Uhoh01=Psiakrew.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/AI_Uhoh02=Jaka szkoda...
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Attack00=Lok-narosh!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Attack01=Nareszcie...
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Attack02=Za Zgładziciela!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Attack03=Nadszedł twój czas!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Attack04=Zmierz się z potęgą Hordy!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Attack05=Nie dajesz mi wyboru.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Attack06=Grzmot i jucha!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/CantMove00=Nie mogę się ruszyć.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Celebrate00=Dobra robota!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Celebrate01=Walczcie, wojownicy!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Comeback00=Do boju, wojownicy! Wróg zaczyna słabnąć!

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroRespond02=Ha, w rzeczy samej.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Falstad00=Ech... Możesz mi już nie opowiadać tej historii?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Horde00=To ja jestem zaszczycony. Lok’tar ogar, wojowniku!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Zaiste, Jaino. W rzeczy samej.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hmm, ciekawe co chciałeś przez to powiedzieć...
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Negative00=Wkrótce przyjdzie nasz czas. Mam nadzieję, że potrafisz dotrzymywać słowa.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Positive00=Do boju! Ku chwale Hordy!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Rehgar00=Ceremoniały do ciebie nie pasują, Rehgarze.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Kill00=Twój los się wypełnił!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Kill01=Na kolana przed potęgą Hordy!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Kill02=Pochłonie cię ziemia!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Kill03=Już po tobie.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Kill04=Ha. No i dobrze.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/KillArthas00=To koniec twoich rządów.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/KillDemon00=Horda nie ugnie się przed byle demonem.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/KillETC00=Pozdrów ode mnie Matkę Ziemię.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/KillHorde00=Niechaj twój duch spoczywa w pokoju, wojowniku.

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zniszczyć ich bazę! Lok’tar!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ping_AttackMerc00=Warto by zdobyć pomoc tych najemników.

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ping_DefendStructure01=Wojownicy, brońcie tej budowli!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ping_DefendThing00=Musimy bronić naszego sojusznika!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ping_DefendThing01=Ten sojusznik nie może zginąć!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ping_DefendTower00=Wojownicy, brońcie tej strażnicy.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Rozpocząć oblężenie tej budowli.

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ping_TurnIn00=Odnieśmy, cośmy zdobyli.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ping_TurnIn01=Odnieśmy to na miejsce.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed00=Jestem wodzem Hordy!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed01=Duchy niespokojne. Potargały sad. A my się bijemy, ładnych parę lat.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed02=Dostałeś kiedyś piorunem tam, gdzie słońce nie dochodzi?!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed03=<wzdycha> Brakuje mi strategii czasu rzeczywistego. To były czasy...
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed04=Ten rzut izometryczny... Ten rozmach bitew...!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed05=Ale szturchania mi nie brakuje. Wychowali mnie ludzie, ale to nie znaczy, że jestem głupcem i nie potrafię zrozumieć pierwszego kliknięcia.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed06=Jak znalazłem się w okopach na Nexusie? To bardzo proste: jestem żonaty, lubię spokój, więc zgłosiłem się na ochotnika.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed07=Dajcie mi wodza, a ja już znajdę dla niego wojnę.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed08=Jestem jedynym orkiem, któremu udało się strollować Hordę.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed09=Posłuchaj rady wodza. Nie rób głupot tylko dlatego, że ktoś zacznie ryczeć „Za Hordę”.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed10=Chciałbym oficjalnie zaprzeczyć plotkom dotyczącym mojego pochodzenia. Mój ród to „Klan Mroźnego Wilka”, a nie żaden „Dom Hamera”.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed11=Zobaczmy, jakie dali mi zdolności... Łańcuch Błyskawic... może być. Dziki Duch... nieźle. Furia Wichru... Ha, przykro mi Rehgarze... Tym razem to ja jestem debeściak.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed12=Żył raz szaman orków, który... lubił podczas burzy tańczyć. Kiedyś piorun go popieścił... i go trzeba niańczyć.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed13=W razie kolejnej wojny z Przymierzem postawię na czele Hordy goblina i wykończymy ich ekonomicznie.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed14=Zaraz, zaraz. To ta gra ma fabułę? Naprawdę zapłaciliście komuś, żeby napisał historię spotkania Raynora i Diablo? Od wymyślania takich rzeczy są fani! <Westchnienie> Mogło być gorzej. To mógł być romans.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Resurrected00=Dziękuję.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Resurrected01=Dobrze, że tu jesteś.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeEnd00=To wszystko?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeEnd01=Oto twoja klęska.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeEnd02=To się nie mogło inaczej skończyć.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeStart00=Zmierz się z wodzem Hordy!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeStart01=Teraz spotka cię moja zemsta.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeStart02=Dosyć tego. Sam się z tobą rozprawię.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Revive00=Jeszcze Horda nie zginęła!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Revive01=Lok’tar ogar!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Revive02=Niech pobłogosławią mnie przodkowie.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_Dance00=Patrz i ucz się od wodza.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_Dance01=Horda tańczy, dusza śpiewa!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_Goodbye00=Niechaj duchy mają cię w swej opiece.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_Goodbye01=Niech cię prowadzą żywioły.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_Hello00=Witaj.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_Hello01=Throm’ka, wojowniku.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_Sorry00=Przepraszam za to.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_Sorry01=Oj. Wybacz.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_Thanks00=Dziękuję ci.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_Thanks01=Aka’Magosh.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_WellPlayed00=Dobre zagranie.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Social_WellPlayed01=Jestem pod wrażeniem.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Spec00=Ha. Dobry wybór.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Spec01=W sam raz.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Spec02=Przepełnia mnie moc.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Spec03=Duchy patrzą na mnie łaskawie.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Spec04=Zaiste, już czuję się silniejszy.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Taunt00=Zniszczą cię żywioły!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Taunt01=Jestem gniewem Hordy!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Taunt02=Zmierz się z synem Durotana!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/TeamKilled00=Nie zniszczycie naszego ducha walki.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_ExLocked00=Lok’tar.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_ExPurchased00=Czego sobie życzysz?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_Gift00=Twój sojusznik to mój sojusznik.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_Lockin00=Chwała Hordzie!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_Purchase00=Za Hordę!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_Trial00=Dobrze. Niech no ci pokażę, jak to się robi.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_Trial01=Patrz uważnie, bo powtarzać nie będę.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitLocked00=Pokażę ci prawdziwą potęgę żywiołów.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitLocked01=Nie zwlekajmy. Trzeba stoczyć wojnę.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitPurchased00=A cóż innego możesz mieć do roboty?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitPurchased01=Jestem wodzem Hordy, bezczynność mi nie przystoi!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used00=Poczuj gniew Zgładziciela!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used01=Dość tego!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used02=Unicestwią cię żywioły!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used03=Dosyć tego!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate2Used00=Niechaj ziemia pochłonie moich wrogów!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate2Used01=Drżyjcie z przerażenia!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate2Used02=Nawet ziemia walczy po mojej stronie!

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed04=Ten rzut izometryczny... Ten rozmach bitew...!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed05=Ale szturchania mi nie brakuje. Wychowali mnie ludzie, ale to nie znaczy, że jestem głupcem i nie potrafię zrozumieć pierwszego kliknięcia.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed06=Jak znalazłem się w okopach na Nexusie? To bardzo proste: jestem żonaty, lubię spokój, więc zgłosiłem się na ochotnika.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed12=Żył raz szaman orków, który... lubił podczas burzy tańczyć. Kiedyś piorun go popieścił... i go trzeba niańczyć.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed13=W razie kolejnej wojny z Przymierzem postawię na czele Hordy goblina i wykończymy ich ekonomicznie.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed14=Zaraz, zaraz. To ta gra ma fabułę? Naprawdę zapłaciliście komuś, żeby napisał historię spotkania Raynora i Diablo? Od wymyślania takich rzeczy są fani! <Westchnienie> Mogło być gorzej. To mógł być romans.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Resurrected00=Dziękuję.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Resurrected01=Dobrze, że tu jesteś.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_Purchase00=Za Hordę!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_Trial00=Dobrze. Niech no ci pokażę, jak to się robi.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_Trial01=Patrz uwaznie, bo powtarzać nie będę.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_WaitLocked00=Pokażę ci prawdziwą potęgę żywiołów.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate2Used00=Niechaj ziemia pochłonie moich wrogów!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate2Used01=Drżyjcie z przerażenia!

VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion00=Gotowi na niezłą jazdę?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion01=Czas pobrzudzić sobie ręce.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_Alarak00=Jesteś tal'darimem? Kijek niebiesko-złotych za mało uwiera w tyłek?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_DVa00=Niezły mech, dzieciaku. Powiedz no, są też niebieskie?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=Królowa Ostrzy... Wygląda na to, że jestem na ciebie skazany.

VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_Zarya00=Dobrze wiedzieć, że nie jestem tu jedynym mięśniakiem.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Jakoś nie pasuje mi walka u boku zerga.

VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroRespond01=Rychło, kurna, w czas.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroRespond02=Zrobimy to po mojemu, kapewu?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Alarak00=Coś ci nie pasuje? Ja tu jestem najwartościowiejszy! Czy jak tam się to mówi.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Ana00=Eee... Że co?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Angry00=Masz jedną szansę, żeby przeprosić. Lepiej z niej skorzystaj.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Bored00=Hę? Ktoś coś mówił?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_DVa00=Eee... ja-aasne. Co to jest selfie, do cholery?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=No popatrz tylko na mnie. Obchodzi mnie to wszystko czy jak?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Excited00=No rychło w czas.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Haha. Co jest, zatkało na mój widok? Nie martw się, maleńka, każdemu się zdarza.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_KerriganGhost00=Ja też nie mogę w to uwierzyć.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Laughter00=Hahahaha!
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Morales00=Jeszcze tylko brakuje stymulantów!
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Murky00=Że co?

VoiceOver/Tychus/KillThrall00=Zielony wykończony. Hehehe.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillTychus00=Niebrzydka bestia z Ciebie… ale walczyć nie umiesz za grosz.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillWarrior00=Tak wygląda młot na tanki!
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillZagara00=Cholera, coraz dziwniejsze te zergi...

VoiceOver/Tychus/LowLifeHeal02=Uff, było blisko.
VoiceOver/Tychus/LowMana00=Brakuje mi many.
VoiceOver/Tychus/LowMana01=Jadę już na oparach many. Co to w ogóle jest?
VoiceOver/Tychus/LowMana02=Ej, kontrolka poziomu many mi zaczęła migać! To źle?

VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AssistHero00=Naszemu przyjacielowi przydałaby się pomoc. Ochotnicy?

VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AssistMe01=Zawsze sam muszę odwalać brudną robotę?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AttackCastle00=Trzeba rozpirzyć ich bazę!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AttackMerc00=Zabierzmy się za ten obóz najemników.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AttackOutpost00=A może zaopiekujemy się ich fortem?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AttackTower00=Może warto by przejąć tę strażnicę?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_DefendCastle00=Bronić bazy!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Lepiej zabierzmy się za obronę tego fortu.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_DefendTower00=Po mojemu nie zaszkodziłoby bronić tej strażnicy.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_KillHero00=No toś się doigrał!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed00=Zły ze mnie człowiek. Bardzo zły.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed01=Będziesz tak szczekać cały dzień?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed02=A w pysk byś nie chciał? Bo w pysk też mogę dać.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed03=Uważaj, z kim tańczysz.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed04=Nie przepadam za pracą zespołową... Zwłaszcza, jeśli w grę wchodzą krowołaki, zombie i temu podobne pierdoły.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed05=Ech, gdyby mi chociaż pozwolili zdjąć to cholerstwo w przerwach między meczami… Na Nexus nie dowożą odświeżaczy powietrza.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed06=Trzeba zainwestować w odświeżacz powietrza. Capi tanim żarciem i petami.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed07=Uwielbiam zapach napalmu o po… Ło, o k… ja p… Cygaro mi wy… Au, au, ja p… O, już po wszystkim. No, nic się nie pali. Alarm odwołany, jedziemy dalej!

VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed09=Zabawimy się tak: nim policzę do dziesięciu, zabierzecie się stąd grzecznie, albo nafaszeruję was ołowiem. Raz... dwa... DZIESIĘĆ!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed10=Prawdę gadali... Na głupotę nie ma lekarstwa.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed11=Hej! Do przyjaciół się nie strzela!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed12=Czy ktokolwiek z tu obecnych widział kiedyś koszary od środka? Nie? Tak myślałem. Powiedzmy, że większość marines prędzej pozwoli się zeżreć mutaliskowi, niż tam wróci.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed13=Też cię kocham, mamuniu… Co? Gdzie? Hej! Mówiłem przecież: nie budzić, nie ruszać, w razie wojny wynieść z łóżkiem!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed14=No więc o co chodzi z tym całym Nexusem? Że niby walczymy ze sobą, aż padniemy, a potem wstajemy i dalej walczymy? Hm, brzmi nieźle!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Resurrected00=Miło z twojej strony.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Resurrected01=W samą porę! Nie przepadam za wąchaniem kwiatków od spodu.

VoiceOver/Tychus/UI_WaitLocked00=Nóżka do nóżki… La, la, la.
VoiceOver/Tychus/UI_WaitLocked01=Emocje jak na grzybach.
VoiceOver/Tychus/UI_WaitPurchased00=Jeszcze trochę, a tu zardzewieję.
VoiceOver/Tychus/UI_WaitPurchased01=Trochę mi się przysnęło. Coś przegapiłem?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ultimate1Used00=Maleńki, gdzie byłeś całe moje życie?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ultimate1Used01=Nie trzeba mi dwa razy powtarzać.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ultimate1Used02=Wielki pies spuszczony ze smyczy!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ultimate2Used00=Lubię widok ognia, nie tylko o poranku.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ultimate2Used01=Ogniem i pieczem!

VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed04=Sprawiedliwość to ja.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed05=Owszem, chowam skrzydła przy aktywacji dopalaczy. Każdy wie, że mech nie potrzebuje skrzydeł, by latać.

VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed12=Niektóre mechy mogą łączyć się ze sobą, tworząc w ten sposób niezwykle potężne machiny wojenne. Niestety, jest to możliwe tylko w ciągu dwóch ostatnich minut walki. To poważna wada konstrukcyjna.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed13=Pierwotny plan zakładał, że postawienie na drodze Kaidżo wielkiego muru wyposażonego w wieżyczki laserowe rozwiąże problem. Lecz mury jak to mury – runą, runą, runą.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed14=Uwaga. Doszło do przegrzania obwodów humorystycznych. Poprzedni dowcip wywołał błąd krytyczny.

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed10=Jestem Tyrande Szept Wiatru, wojowniczka o miłość i sprawiedliwość. Ukarzę cię w imieniu Eluny.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed11=Bogini, daj mi siłę i wytrwałość. Spraw, by moje strzały zawsze trafiały do celu. A jeśli już dziś wezwiesz mnie do siebie, daj mi zginąć z pustym kołczanem.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed12=Chciałabym mieć tysiąc lat na babskie pogaduchy. Albo i dwa tysiące...
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed13=Mamy z Malfurionem jedną zasadę w związku - nie stosujemy zmiennokształtności. Nie kręci mnie to.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed14=O Tygrysie, bogów blasku, w nocnym hasasz sobie lasku. Jakaś nieśmiertelna gała twę symetrię stworzyć miała. W jakich głębi uroczyskach łypią wielkie twe oczyska?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Resurrected00=Czeka nas wiele pracy.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Resurrected01=Jestem twoją dłużniczką.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Revive00=Niech bogini obdarzy mnie siłą.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Revive01=Walka dopiero się zaczęła!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Revive02=Szybko! Muszę powrócić na pole bitwy!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec00=Roztropny wybór.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec01=Jesteśmy jednomyślni.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec02=Wola bogini jest święta.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec03=Obfite błogosławieństwo.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec04=To powinno pomóc.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt00=Niech bogini się nad tobą zmiłuje, bo ja tego nie uczynię!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt01=Pożałujesz swego zuchwalstwa.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt02=Dziś dowiesz się, co to znaczy strach...
VoiceOver/Tyrande/TeamKilled00=Cierpliwości... Nasz czas w końcu nadejdzie.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_ExLocked00=Ishnu-alah.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_ExPurchased00=Niech łaska Eluny ci przyświeca.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_Gift00=Idę tam, gdzie prowadzi mnie wola bogini.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_Lockin00=Idę za głosem Eluny.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_Purchase00=Mądry wybór.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_Trial00=Jestem gotowa.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_Trial01=To proste zadanie.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_WaitLocked00=Mam zademonstrować swoje umiejętności?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_WaitLocked01=Chodźmy! Dołączmy do łowów.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_WaitPurchased00=Jestem wojowniczką i kapłanką. Jeśli chcesz się tylko pogapić, znajdź sobie kogoś innego.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_WaitPurchased01=Nie przydzielam już zadań. Mam ciekawsze rzeczy do zrobienia – nie każ mi tu stać.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ultimate1Used00=Stąpam w cieniu Eluny!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ultimate1Used01=Wkraczamy w cień!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ultimate2Used00=Poczuj gniew niebios!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ultimate2Used01=Niech spopieli cię blask bogini!

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes01=Niech tak będzie.

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes03=Niech się stanie wola bogini.

VoiceOver/Uther/Attack05=Światłość jest z nami.
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack06=Jam jest młot sprawiedliwości!
VoiceOver/Uther/Celebrate00=Zaprawdę, wielka jest nasza odwaga!
VoiceOver/Uther/Celebrate01=Nie dawać wrogowi ani chwili wytchnienia!

VoiceOver/Uther/Healed00=Niech Światłość błogosławi twe uzdrawiające dłonie.
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed01=Dzięki.
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed02=Wyborne uleczenie!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree00=Jestem z tobą.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree01=Pojąłem.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree02=Twój zapał godny jest pochwały.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroBoast00=Światłość poprowadzi nas do zwycięstwa!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroBoast01=Będziemy walczyć z honorem!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion00=Gotowi porazić wrogów mocą Światłości?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion01=Gotowi?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=Zawsze z dumą służę u boku wojowników Przymierza.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Dlaczego miałbym ci zaufać, chłopcze?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Zakładam, że to ty jesteś tym krzyżowcem, o którym tyle słyszałem.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Greymane00=Genn Szarogrzywy we własnej osobie. Najwyższy czas, by Gilneas dołączył do walki.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Och. Horda. A zapowiadał się taki miły dzień.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Impressed00=Hmm, wygląda na to, że widok pola bitwy nie jest ci obcy.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Lady Jaino, zaszczyt to dla mnie znów walczyć u twego boku.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Król Szkieletów, tak? Subtelność nie jest najwyraźniej twoją mocną stroną.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_LightVictory00=<Do not record. Reuses Boast00>
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Medic00=Ha! Dobrze cię widzieć, towarzyszko broni!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Jakie dokładnie masz zamiary?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Nekromanta, tak? Szczerze mówiąc, nie przepadam za twoimi konfratrami.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Negative00=A więc to ty...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Czas, aby naszych wrogów dosięgło długie ramię sprawiedliwości!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Stitches00=Na Światłość, co z ciebie za plugastwo!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Sylwana? Ze śmiercią ci do twarzy…
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Varian? Gdym cię ostatni raz widział, byłeś jeszcze pacholęciem.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Wydaje mi się, czy wy, zergi, robicie się coraz dziwniejsze?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zuljin00=A więc to jest ten słynny Zul'jin. Nie mogę powiedzieć, żebym był pod wrażeniem.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond00=Zawsze.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond01=Z przyjemnością.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond02=Na Światłość!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Chwała Przymierzu!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Angry00=To cię będzie kosztowało uzdrowienie. Właśnie kiedy będziesz go najbardziej potrzebować.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Zamknij jadaczkę, albo zrobię to za ciebie.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Chyba właśnie ogłuchłem.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Cranky00=Za moich czasów szanowaliśmy starszych. A zwłaszcza uzdrowicieli!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Oj, błagam... Władałem mocą Światłości, kiedy jeszcze na chleb mówiłaś: „bep”, a na muchy: „tapty”.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Tak, tak, pojęliśmy: łatwo się irytujesz. Gratulacje! Czy teraz możemy kontynuować?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Excited00=Ha! Czekają nas niezapomniane wrażenia.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Greymane00=Ha, dobrze to słyszeć, stary psie… znaczy wilku!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Horde00=Może nie zdajesz sobie z tego sprawy, ale dodanie określenia „Nowa” do Hordy nie oczyszcza was z dawnych przewin.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Impressed00=Dobrze, pokaż zatem, na co cię stać.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Jaina00=To ja ponoszę winę. Jest to brzemię, które zabiorę ze sobą do grobu.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Nic dziwnego, że zabili cię twoi poddani.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Medic00=Tak? Chodzi o moje olbrzymich rozmiarów naramienniki czy o magiczny młot bojowy pierwszej pomocy?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Zwą cię bohaterem? Ha! A to paradne! Zdrapywałem już z butów błoto, które odznaczało się większym heroizmem.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Murky00=Chcesz, żebym ci powiedział, co o tym myślę?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=To brzmi bardzo znajomo.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Negative00=Och, zawrzyj gębę. Przed nami bitwa, którą trzeba wygrać.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NewRace00=Pochodzisz z Azeroth? Człowiek opuszcza planetę na kilka lat i wszystko schodzi na psy.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NightElf00=A już myślałem, że elfy wysokiego rodu są zarozumiałe.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ha! Pokażmy tym niegodziwcom, na co nas stać!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Stitches00=Nie zamierzam zaszczycić tego czegoś odpowiedzią.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=A już myślałem, że życie po życiu nieco utemperuje twój charakterek.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Uncaring00=Och, miałem się tym przejąć? Ha! A to dobre!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Varian00=Za Przymierze!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Lepiej zapamiętaj, po której stronie walczysz, stworze.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zuljin00=Tak. Dokładnie takiego komentarza mogłem się spodziewać po trollu.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill00=Sprawiedliwości stało się zadość.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill01=Idź w stronę światłości... szybko!
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill02=Koniec z tobą.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill03=Dokonało się.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill04=Nawet nie próbujesz.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAlliance00=Błagam cię o wybaczenie.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAngel00=Hm… Chyba właśnie zabiłem Uzdrowicielkę Dusz...
VoiceOver/Uther/KillArthas00=Obyś zgnił w piekle, chłopcze.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillChogall00=Wygląda na to, że ogrzy magowie nie mogą się jednak równać z paladynami.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillCrusader00=Och, a więc jesteś ode mnie o klasę lepsza.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDemon00=Zgiń, przepadnij w Otchłani! Czy gdzie tam trafiacie…
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDiablo00=Świat nie będzie dłużej nosić twojej ohydy, demonie!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillGuldan00=Nawet tak zwane „Wcielenie Ciemności” musi się ukorzyć przed Światłością.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillHorde00=Horda nigdy nie uczy się na błędach.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillJaina00=<sigh> Wielce niefortunne...
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKaelthas00=Wciąż musisz się wiele nauczyć, Kael'thasie.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKerrigan00=Dosięgła cię sprawiedliwość, Kerrigan.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillMedivh00=Co rozpoczęło ostrze Lothara, niech zakończy mój młot.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillPaladin00=Niech Światłość ulituje się nad moją duszą.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillRaynor00=Chyba musisz jeszcze potrenować, Raynorze.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillScourge00=Póki żyję, Lordaeron nigdy nie ugnie się przed twą plugawą Plagą.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillSpreeEnd00=Niezła próba.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillVarian00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillWar200=Ach, jak za starych, dobrych czasów.
VoiceOver/Uther/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal00=Dobrze, że czuwasz.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal01=Zawdzięczam ci życie.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal02=Masz mą dozgonną wdzięczność.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana00=Brakuje mi many.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana01=Wyczerpuje mi się mana.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana02=Kończy mi się mana.
VoiceOver/Uther/No00=Nie.
VoiceOver/Uther/No01=Niemożliwe.
VoiceOver/Uther/No02=Nie mogę.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistHero00=Sprzymierzeniec jest w potrzebie!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe00=Przydałaby mi się pomocna dłoń!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe01=Hej! Jest tam kto?
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackCastle00=Atakujmy bazę wroga.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackMerc00=Powinniśmy zająć ten obóz najemników.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zaatakujmy ten fort!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackTower00=Zajmijmy tę strażnicę!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendCastle00=Bronić naszej bazy!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Bronić naszego fortu!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendTower00=Powinniśmy bronić naszej strażnicy.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_KillHero00=Musimy powalić tego przeciwnika!
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed00=Błogosławi nam Światłość.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed01=Światłość opromienia nas wszystkich.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed02=Jestem już za stary na te podchody.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed03=Czasami światło w tunelu to nadjeżdżający pociąg.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed04=Dobry paladyn zawsze znajdzie miejsce na dodatkową flaszeczkę... wody święconej.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed05=Ze Światłością nie ma żartów. Trzeba używać kremu z filtrem.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed06=Klików ci u nas dostatek, ale i te przyjmiemy.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed07=Za moich czasów to paladyni na kartki byli!
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed08=I mogliśmy awansować tylko do poziomu dziesiątego. Jaki maksymalny poziom możecie teraz zdobyć? Setny? A może jeszcze wyższy? Ech, ta dzisiejsza młodzież.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed09=Nikt nie spodziewa się paladyńskiej inkwizycji!
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed10=Możesz posmyrać jeszcze raz, ale trochę w lewo?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed11=O, właśnie tutaj.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed12=Światłość! Światłość widzę!
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed13=Tylko nie zaglądaj do mojej krypty – może tam panować bardzo... ożywiona atmosfera.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed14=A tak na marginesie, wiem, co krwawe elfy zamierzają zrobić z moim grobem, i wcale mi się to nie podoba. Nic a nic.
VoiceOver/Uther/Resurrected00=Rad jestem, że walczysz po mojej stronie.
VoiceOver/Uther/Resurrected01=Dzięki za ratunek.
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive00=Za Przymierze!
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive01=Wybiła godzina sprawiedliwości!
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive02=Dobrze. Spróbujmy jeszcze raz.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec00=Mądry wybór.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec01=Wiara jest moją siłą.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec02=Może się przydać.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec03=Doskonały wybór.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec04=Uczynię, co w mojej mocy.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt00=Pokaż, na co cię stać.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt01=Tchórzostwo nie jest cnotą!
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt02=Walczę młotem... Z młotem.
VoiceOver/Uther/TeamKilled00=Robię się na to wszystko za stary.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_ExLocked00=Bądź pozdrowiony, wędrowcze!
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_ExPurchased00=Witaj, przyjacielu.

VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Trial00=Korzystaj z okazji i podziwiaj paladyna w akcji.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Trial01=Nigdy nie wystawiaj Światłości na próbę!
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitLocked00=Jam jest młot sprawiedliwości!
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitLocked01=Paladyni stanowią trzon armii Przymierza. Z pewnością przyda ci się moja pomoc.

VoiceOver/WizardA/SixKill00=Sześciu zabitych! Brawo ja!
VoiceOver/WizardA/SixKill01=Sześciu zabitych!
VoiceOver/WizardA/TeamKill00=Wróg został zdominowany. Doskonale!
VoiceOver/WizardA/TenKill00=Jestem legendą!
VoiceOver/WizardA/TripleKill00=Trzech zabitych! Nieźle!
VoiceOver/WizardA/TripleKill01=Trzech zabitych!
VoiceOver/WizardA/TripleKill02=Trzech zabitych!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Attack00=Do ataku!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Attack01=Dość czekania. Atakujmy teraz!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Attack02=Uwolnij swą moc!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Caution00=Ostrożnie. Wróg coś knuje.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_GoodJob00=Niezwykle imponujące!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_GoodJob01=Być może nie jestem osamotnionym geniuszem w tej drużynie.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_GoodJob02=Udało ci się wiele osiągnąć!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Heal00=Przyda ci się wizyta u studni leczenia.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Heal01=W pobliżu są studnie leczenia. Skorzystaj z nich.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Retreat00=Odwrót!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Retreat01=Wycofać się!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Uhoh00=O nie.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Uhoh01=Nie wszystko poszło zgodnie z planem.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Uhoh02=To było smutne.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack00=I jak się teraz czujesz?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack01=I do piachu!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack02=Śmiesz MNIE atakować?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack03=Tego nie było w planie, co?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack04=Wkrótce tego pożałujesz.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack05=Nie zasługujesz na to.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack06=Nie wiem, po co się wysilam.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Celebrate00=Ha! Wiedziałam, że nam się uda!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Celebrate01=Tak! Zwycięstwo jest w zasięgu ręki.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Comeback00=Bądźcie silni, przyjaciele. Nie zawiedziemy!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Healed00=Uleczyłam się.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Healed01=Ach, wracam do zdrowia.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Healed02=Ach, wróciłam do zdrowia.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree00=Może być ciekawie.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree01=Uznaj to za mały pokaz moich możliwości.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree02=Poczekaj, aż zobaczysz, co potrafię.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroBoast00=To nie skończy się dobrze. Przynajmniej dla nich.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroBoast01=Zbyt długo ćwiczyłam się w wiedzy tajemnej, by mogła mnie pokonać piątka przybłędów bez kwalifikacji.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion00=Gotowi na zwycięstwo?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion01=Mam nadzieję, że przygotowaliście się na tę walkę.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Chcesz doświadczyć kolejnej druzgocącej porażki, Azmodanie?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Oto gęba, której nie chciałam oglądać nigdy więcej.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Wrogowie, z którymi się mierzymy, mogą okazać się naszym największym jak dotąd wyzwaniem.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Deckard00=Cain! Znowu cię odnalazłam.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Walczymy po tej samej stronie? Nie dostrzegam w tym sensu.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_LordofHell00=Po walce zostanie mi dość mocy, by wysłać cię z powrotem do piekła.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_MagicUser00=Naprawdę ktoś jeszcze korzysta z tych przestarzałych zaklęć?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=Anioł Śmierci... tutaj?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Jakim rodzajem potwora jesteś? Masz może jakieś... afiksy?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Nekromanta... Znasz może Mehtana?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Mam walczyć u twojego boku? Nie do wiary...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Ta walka zapewni nam wiele zabawy. Jestem o tym przekonana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_SpaceLordLeoric00=Twoje zło tutaj nie zatriumfuje, Kosmiczny Imperatorze!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Cieszę się, że do mnie dołączyłeś, Tyraelu.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond00=Naturalnie!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond01=To nie stanowi problemu.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond02=Wprost nie mogę się doczekać.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Może damy sobie spokój z tą walką i zaczniemy pojedynek?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Wszędzie będziesz za mną łaził i ględził?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Mhm. Tak, oczywiście.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Zawsze odznaczałeś się niezwykłą elokwencją.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Z pewnością nie przybyło im rozumu.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Jakoś byłam pewna, że to właśnie powiesz.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Ach! Czy naprawdę musimy?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=Musiałeś tych wyzwisk szukać w słowniku?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Lepiej niż mój sojusz z tobą.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_LordofHell00=To nie ja pogrążam tę drużynę.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_MagicUser00=Patrz uważnie, a być może nauczysz się czegoś nowego.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=Mam nadzieję, że ktoś podetnie ci skrzydła.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Jeśli nie jesteś w stanie sformułować inteligentnej wypowiedzi, po prostu zamilknij.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Tak się składa, że jestem czarownicą. I to ty wyglądasz na nieco... wytrąconego z równowagi.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Tylko nie myśl za dużo. Może ci zaszkodzić.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Po raz pierwszy od dawna nie muszę wszystkiego robić sama. Ooo, co za ulga!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Heh, zapowiada się wspaniała zabawa.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_SpaceLordLeoric00=Ukarzę cię w imieniu gwiazd!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Nie chciałabym walczyć inaczej.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=Hmm... Może nie powinnam była uciekać z Sanktuarium...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill00=Nie można mnie powstrzymać!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill01=Jestem tak dobra, że sama się zaskakuję.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill02=Gdyby tylko mogli mnie teraz zobaczyć.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill03=Na nic twoja obrona!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill04=Dopiero się rozgrzewam!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillAngel00=Nigdy nie lekceważ nefalemki.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillButcher00=I kto jest teraz świeżym mięsem?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDeckard00=Ech, w co się tym razem wplątałeś, Deckardzie?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDemon00=Nigdy nie zostawisz mnie w spokoju, prawda?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiablo00=To za Leę!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiabloHero00=Hmm, czy to był ktoś ważny?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillJaina00=Lepiej być czarownicą niż jakąś tam maginią.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillKaelthas00=Elfi magowie twojego pokroju po prostu sobie ze mną nie radzą...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillLeoric00=Ech, ile razy będę musiała to jeszcze robić?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMalthael00=Hmm. Za drugim razem giniesz jeszcze szybciej.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMedivh00=Pojedynek czarodziejów skończony. Przegrywasz!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillNephalem00=Nie chciałam tego zrobić. Przysięgam!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Haha! To było nawet zabawne.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillTyrael00=Przepraszam za to, przyjacielu.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillWeird00=Teraz nie żyjesz, ale wcześniej? Co to było za życie?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh00=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh01=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh02=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh03=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh04=<larger laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal00=Dziękuję ci za uzdrowienie.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal01=Najwyraźniej czuwa nade mną nowy anioł stróż.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal02=Masz doskonałe wyczucie czasu!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana00=Potrzebuję many.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana01=Mam za mało many.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana02=Potrzebuję więcej many.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No00=Dlaczego mam to zrobić?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No01=Nie ma mowy.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No02=Nie zamierzam tego robić.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Ten wojownik potrzebuje naszego wsparcia.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Może ktoś by mi pomógł?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Potrzebuję... pomocy!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Czas zaatakować ich bazę!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Chcę zająć ten obóz najemników.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zaatakujmy ten fort!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Powinniśmy zająć tę strażnicę!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Nasza baza nie może upaść! Przegramy!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Prędko! Musimy bronić fortu!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Powinniśmy bronić tej strażnicy.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_KillHero00=Musimy zgładzić tego bohatera.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed00=Wypełnię swoje przeznaczenie.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed01=Magia zawsze przychodziła mi z łatwością.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed02=Tak, to ja jestem czarownicą, która zniszczyła Sanktuarium Yshari. Nie miałam wyboru.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed03=Jest tam kto? Hej, oczy mam tutaj. Wiem, że jestem czarująca, ale bez przesady!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed04=Przez lata zgłębiałam pradawne tajemnice magii, bo przypadło mi w losie bycie denerwowaną przez ciebie. Jak do tego doszło?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed05=To wyśmienita okazja do wypróbowania mojego zaklęcia wyciszającego.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed06=Zobaczmy, jak poradzisz sobie z tym!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed07=(Muffled sounds of confusion as the Wizard realizes she silenced herself)
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed08=Ehem, nigdy wcześniej nie zdarzyło mi się nic podobnego.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed09=Jeśli piśniesz o tym komuś choć słówko, wystrzelę cię w kosmos!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed10=Moi nauczyciele twierdzili, że mam o sobie zbyt wysokie mniemanie. Nonsens! W porównaniu z moimi obecnymi możliwościami jako uczennica cierpiałam wręcz na zaniżoną samoocenę!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed11=Mam wspaniałą figurę, prawda? Cóż, jako czarownica jestem zobowiązana, żeby ważyć tyle, co kaczka.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed12=Raz zdarzyło mi się rzucić magiczny pocisk prosto w ciemność... Heh, nie była zachwycona.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed13=Jestem czarownicą i zaczaruję ten świat... Hahahaha! Oraz kilka innych.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed14=Isendra była wspaniałą nauczycielką, ale nie podzieliła się ze mną wszystkimi tajemnicami. Nadal nie wiem, jak była w stanie teleportować się tak szybko... i to bez czasu odnowienia!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed15=Nie latam na miotle. Mogę ci nią najwyżej przywalić.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected00=Od dzisiaj mam nowego ulubionego uzdrowiciela!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected01=Kapłani Zakarum nie dorastają ci do pięt!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive00=Wygląda na to, że dzisiaj jednak nie umrę.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive01=Och, nie o to mi chodziło...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive02=Chyba powinnam być ostrożniejsza. A może jednak nie?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec00=He he, moja moc rośnie.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec01=Całkiem zacnie.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec02=Hahahaha! Zdobywam kolejny poziom!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec03=Hm... moja wiedza rośnie.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec04=Nabieram mocy.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt00=Twój koniec jest bliski!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt01=Przygotuj się na śmierć.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt02=Godny przeciwnik!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/TeamKilled00=Nie możemy tracić nadziei w obliczu przeciwności losu.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_ExLocked00=Potrzebujesz pomocy czarownicy?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Jestem tu, by pomóc.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Gift00=Udam się tam, gdzie jestem potrzebna!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Lockin00=Ta kraina mnie potrzebuje.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Purchase00=Wiedziałam, że mi się spodobasz.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial00=Mam się popisywać? Ha ha ha ha!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial01=Magia nie jest błahostką, z którą można igrać. Ale dla ciebie zrobię wyjątek.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Powiedz tylko słowo.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Jestem problemem dla wrogów i najlepszym rozwiązaniem dla twojej drużyny.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Jestem gotowa.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ruszę się dzisiaj gdzieś jeszcze?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used00=Nie poradzisz sobie ze mną!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used01=Wybiła twoja ostatnia godzina!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used02=Posmakuj mocy tajemnej!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used03=<laughs>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate2Used00=Trzymaj się z daleka!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate2Used01=Dosyć tego!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Cheer00=<Cheering exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Cheer01=<Cheering exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled00=<Pulled Exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled01=<Pulled Exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled02=<Pulled Exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled03=<Pulled Exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled04=<Pulled Exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineFive00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineFour00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineOne00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineThree00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineTwo00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/WorthIt00=Ha! Dorwałam cię! Do diabła z konsekwencjami.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/WorthIt01=Bywało gorzej.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes00=Hm. Jak sobie chcesz.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes01=W porządku.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes02=Do dzieła.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes03=Dokąd zmierzamy?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes04=Wygląda na to, że moim podróżom nie ma końca.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes05=Co ja tutaj w ogóle robię?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes06=Ach, czasami naprawdę tęsknię za Kaldeum.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes07=Gdyby to było łatwe, wszyscy by to potrafili.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes08=Moje zaklęcia są gotowe.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes09=Heh czemu nie?
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack00=Atakujemy! Wróg jest osłabiony!
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack01=Wróg okazał słabość. Do ataku!
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack02=Tak, widzę. Czas atakować!
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Caution00=Uwaga, nasz wróg coś planuje.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob00=Doskonale zabijasz.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob01=Nikt nas nie powstrzyma.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob02=Bardzo dobrze.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Heal00=Wylecz się. Już.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Heal01=Ruszaj do studni leczenia, póki jest czas.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Retreat00=Muszę się wycofać.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Retreat01=Na razie się wycofam.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh00=Zły ruch.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh01=<gniewne warknięcie>
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh02=Niekorzystnie.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack00=Pożremy ich.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack01=Moja ofiara jest blisko.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack02=Poznaj furię roju!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack03=Jestem twoją śmiercią!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack04=<angry growl>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack05=Rój cię zmiażdży!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack06=Teraz zapłacisz!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Celebrate00=Za rój!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Celebrate01=Zwyciężamy!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Comeback00=Doganiamy wroga! Nie ustępujcie.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death00=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death01=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death02=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death03=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death04=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death05=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death06=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death07=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed00=Doskonale, sługo.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed01=Moje rany zostały wyleczone.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed02=Leczę się.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree00=Dobrze.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree01=Każdy, kto nam się sprzeciwi, zginie.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree02=Rój podbije wszystko!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroBoast00=Teraz rozedrzemy ich na strzępy!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroBoast01=Niech nasz wróg pozna furię roju!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion00=Możemy zaczynać, sługo?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion01=Ruszamy rozerwać ich na strzępy?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Abathur00=Nie rozczaruj mnie, mistrzu ewolucji.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Anubarak00=Wiesz... świetnie byś pasował do mojego Roju.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=Moja królowo...
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Hm... Ciekawe z ciebie stworzenie.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Hm... To ty. To ja. To my.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Nareszcie, godny sojusznik.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond00=Rój jest gotowy.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond01=Głupie pytanie.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond02=Będziemy ewoluować. Będziemy podbijać.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Abathur00=Nadszedł nasz czas, Abaturze! Za Rój!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Anubarak00=Ty biomaso!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Bez wątpienia.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Murky00=Co ty właśnie do mnie powiedziałeś?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Negative00=Cisza. Mamy bitwę do wygania.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Positive00=Pokażmy tym głupcom furię Roju!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill00=Padnij przed potęgą roju!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill01=Żałosne stworzenie.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill02=Miernota i słabizna.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill03=Nie macie żadnych szans.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill04=Zwyciężam.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillAbathur00=Twoje miejsce jest w komorze ewolucyjnej, nie na polu walki.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillDemon00=Hm, jaka silna esencja. Abatur powinien to zbadać...
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillKerrigan00=Teraz to ja jestem sercem Roju!
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillProtoss00=Jak ja uwielbiam trzask kości protosów.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillSpreeEnd00=Nadeszła na ciebie pora.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillTerran00=Bezużyteczni terranie.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillZagara00=Jestem pierwszą pośród matek szczepu!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Laugh01=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal00=Znów jestem zdrowa! Bardzo dobrze.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal01=Zawdzięczam ci życie...
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal02=W samą porę, sługo.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana00=Potrzebuję więcej many.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana01=Mam mało many.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana02=Kończy mi się mana.
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd00=GIŃCIE, ROBAKI!
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd01=GIŃCIE, ROBAKI!
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd02=GIŃCIE, ROBAKI!
VoiceOver/Zagara/No00=Nie mogę spełnić tego żądania.
VoiceOver/Zagara/No01=Niemożliwe.
VoiceOver/Zagara/No02=Nie, nie mogę.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistHero00=Wspomóżcie naszego sojusznika!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistMe00=Mój szczep jest atakowany!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistMe01=Wróg mnie atakuje!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zniszczmy bazę wroga!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackMerc00=Radzę zająć ten obóz najemników.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zniszczmy ten fort!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackTower00=Zabezpieczmy tę strażnicę.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendCastle00=Brońcie naszej bazy.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Powinniśmy bronić tego fortu.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendTower00=Powinniśmy bronić tej strażnicy.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_KillHero00=Ten bohater ma umrzeć!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed00=Mój szczep jest gotowy.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed01=Rój jest nienasycony.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed02=Dlaczego nie powijasz więcej nadrządców?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed03=Jestem zabójczą królową.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed04=Gdy dobra jest biomasa, to się zergom lepiej hasa!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed05=To żadna martwica! Chyba że twojego mózgu!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed06=Boże, chroń królową! Reszta może zginąć...
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed07=Ciężko jest samotnej matce szczepu, która ma do wykarmienia cztery i pół miliona zergów.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed08=Mój ci rój!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed09=Gdy już zostanę Królową Ostrzy, nie będę musiała cię tolerować.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed10=Mam dopiero cztery lata i już zostałam matką szczepu. Oby mój ojciec szczepu się nie dowiedział.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed11=<długie, dziwne, zergowe dźwięki> Wybacz, to mój naturalny akcent.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed12=Co ty robisz? Odwróć się! Nie wiesz, że to nieuprzejme patrzeć, jak królowa powija swoje larwy?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed13=Czy mój odwłok nie wygląda grubo?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed14=Zergu, zergu mój malutki, rośnij duży, okrąglutki.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Resurrected00=Razem jesteśmy nieśmiertelni.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Resurrected01=Regeneracja zakończona.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Revive00=Rój jest wieczny.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Revive01=Tak łatwo się mnie nie pozbędziecie.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Revive02=Choćbyście zabili mnie tysiąc razy, i tak wrócę!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec00=Mutacja zakończona.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec01=Tak, to mi się przyda.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec02=Już się czuję silniejsza!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec03=Doskonale.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec04=Nic mnie teraz nie powstrzyma.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Taunt00=Jestem Zagara, słuchajcie mnie i drżyjcie!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Taunt01=Nie ma dla ciebie nadziei!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Taunt02=Czeka cię jedynie śmierć!
VoiceOver/Zagara/TeamKilled00=Zapłacą za to własnym życiem.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_ExLocked00=Mów, terraninie.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_ExPurchased00=Jak mogę ci służyć?
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Gift00=Kolejny świat do podbicia?
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Lockin00=Rój trwa.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Purchase00=Rój jest na twoje rozkazy.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Trial00=Mój szczep przetrwa każdą próbę.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Trial01=Pokażę ci chwałę roju.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitLocked00=Sprawdzasz moją cierpliwość.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitLocked01=Lepiej by było, gdybym spędziła ten czas na polu walki.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitPurchased00=Nie widzę celu w twojej bezczynności. Być może brak ci wizji.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitPurchased01=Moje szpony pragną rozrywać ciała wrogów. Możemy zaczynać?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used00=Ziemia drży...
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used01=Powstań, czerwiu!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used02=Oto czerw nydusowy!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used03=Rój powstaje!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate2Used00=Rój pożre wszystkich!
