Conversation/CreepVO/Line00242=Qui sera le premier à faire main basse sur mon trésor ? <rire>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00247=Hmm, qu’est-ce que nous avons là ? D’autres flibustiers venus tenter la fortune dans la baie de Cœur-Noir ?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00248=Alors, marins d’eau douce ! Ici, tout le monde présente ses respects au capitaine. Et le capitaine ne respecte qu’une chose : l’argent ! Ha ha !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00249=Je me fiche de la manière, du moment que vous m’apportez des doublons.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00250=Vol...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00251=Meurtre... peu importe !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00252=Amenez-vous à mon rafiot, et allongez les doublons ! Quant à moi, je donnerai la monnaie de leur pièce à vos ennemis ! Ha ha ha !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00254=Sachez que ce monde est sous MA protection. Je le plie à MA volonté.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00255=Si vous voulez la victoire, récupérez des tributs en mon nom.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00256=Soyez les premiers et vous recevrez ma bénédiction.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00257=Vos ennemis tomberont… Leurs défenses seront paralysées et affaiblies.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00258=Vous feriez mieux de ne pas gaspiller votre avantage. Ma faveur n’est pas éternelle.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00259=Qu’en dites-vous ? Prêts à commencer ?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00260=Vous osez pénétrer dans le val maudit ? Amusant.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00261=La mine va s’ouvrir, héros… Bientôt, les morts-vivants se réveilleront.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00262=La mort rôde dans la mine… Oserez-vous affronter ses ténèbres ?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00263=Vous êtes prêts à combattre les morts-vivants ? La mine ouvrira bientôt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00264=Les morts se relèvent, héros. Oserez-vous pénétrer dans la mine ?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00265=Plus de retour en arrière, désormais…
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00266=Entrez héros, les damnés vous attendent.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00267=Vous les entendez cliqueter ? (sombre) Je crois qu’ils ont faim…
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00268=Réveillez-vous, golems ! Prenez vie et déchaînez votre colère !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00269=Golems ! Levez-vous et marchez !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00270=Il est temps que mes golems reviennent à la vie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00271=Félicitations, votre golem est plus fort que celui de vos ennemis.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00272=Votre golem est terminé... Mais il est plus faible que celui de vos adversaires.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00273=Les deux golems ont l’air d’être de force égale.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00274=Les golems revivent… Le vôtre est beaucoup plus puissant.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00275=Bien joué. Votre golem est bien plus puissant que celui de votre adversaire.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00276=Les golems se réveillent… Mais soyez prudent, le vôtre est beaucoup plus faible que celui de votre adversaire.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00277=Il va vous falloir davantage de crânes, si vous voulez un golem plus puissant.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00278=Les golems ont repris vie. Ils sont de force équivalente.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00279=Hm. On dirait que les deux golems sont de puissance quasiment égale.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00280=Mes golems se réveillent… Cela devrait être amusant.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00281=Libérez votre colère dévastatrice !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00282=Accrochez-vous, on sera bientôt à tombeau ouvert.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00283=<rire sinistre>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00284=Excellent, l’attraction principale est sur le point d’ouvrir ses portes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00285=Eh bien, ça se présente de façon tout à fait macabre.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00286=Bienvenue, héros inconscients… dans la mine hantée. Un territoire où la mort règne pour l’éternité.…
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00287=Bientôt la mine ouvrira  ses portes… et les horreurs qu’elle contient seront libérées.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00288=Vous et moi, nous pourrions conclure un pacte qui nous serait mutuellement bénéfique.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00289=Tuez les morts-vivants. Arrachez-leur leurs crânes maudits.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00290=En retour, j’invoquerai mes puissants golems sépulcraux.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00291=Ils détruiront les défenses de votre ennemi. Alors, marché conclu ?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00292=Les anciens sanctuaires s’animent. Prenez-en le contrôle pour libérer le chevalier dragon !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00293=Les sanctuaires sont en train de collecter de la puissance. Entendez l’appel du chevalier dragon à travers la pierre.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00294=Bientôt, les sanctuaires s’animeront, héros…
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00295=La puissance s’accumule dans les sanctuaires. Libérez le courroux du dragon !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00296=Dépêchez-vous, activez les sanctuaires et la puissance du dragon sera vôtre.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00297=Le repos du dragon doit prendre fin… Libérez sa puissance !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00298=Activez les sanctuaires. Utilisez la puissance du chevalier dragon !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00299=Libérez le chevalier dragon et massacrez vos ennemis !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00300=Il est temps ! Libérez le chevalier dragon !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00301=La puissance du chevalier dragon est vôtre, héros !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00302=Dévastez vos ennemis !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00303=Votre ennemi contrôle les sanctuaires, héros…
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00304=Et maintenant vous allez connaître le courroux du dragon.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00305=Votre temps est compté, héros.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00306=Que vos ennemis brûlent !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00307=Je vais réduire vos ennemis en cendres !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00308=Je revis !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00309=Vous allez brûler.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00310=Les flammes purifieront tout.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00311=Je vais vous réduire en cendres.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00312=Je ne retournerai pas dans cette prison ! Non !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00313=Non… Je n’en ai pas fini !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00314=Les dragons régneront à nouveau !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00315=Les dragons règnent sur ce monde !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00316=Ce sont les jardins de Comté-du-Dragon… Ils sont magnifiques, n’est-ce pas ? Mais ils sont fondés sur un mensonge…
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00317=Les gens ont oublié ma lignée, et le fait que ce royaume était autrefois dirigé par les dragons.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00318=Activez les sanctuaires du soleil et de la lune, et la magie qui retient le chevalier dragon faiblira.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00319=Je vous prêterai sa puissance. Brûlez vos ennemis. Brisez leurs fortifications. Rappelez à ce monde son véritable héritage.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00320=Le dragon va renaître. Vous pouvez en prendre le contrôle ou en être la cible… À vous de choisir.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00321=Votre golem est plus faible que celui de votre adversaire. Préparez vos défenses.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00322=Vos golems sont de force équivalente. Préparez-vous.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00323=La création est terminée. Votre golem surpasse celui de vos adversaires.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00324=Votre golem est plus fort que celui de vos adversaires. Profitez-en.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00325=Un golem faible. Récoltez davantage de crânes, héros.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00326=C’est terminé. Votre golem est équivalent à celui de vos adversaires.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00327=Libérez-vous et détruisez vos ennemis !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00328=Tuez les morts-vivants et récupérez leur crâne, héros.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00329=Récupérez des crânes pour rendre votre golem plus puissant !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00330=Les damnés reviendront bientôt. Préparez-vous, héros.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00331=Écoutez, héros… Les morts-vivants de la mine se réveilleront bientôt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00332=Réveillez-vous, mes golems et faites exploser votre colère toute-puissante !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00333=Les sanctuaires se réveillent à nouveau. Qui prendra le contrôle de la puissance du chevalier dragon ?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00334=Le dragon vous attend, héros ! Libérez-le et détruisez votre ennemi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00335=L’heure est venue ! Libérez la puissance du dragon !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00336=La fin est proche, le dragon va renaître entre les mains de votre ennemi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00337=Votre ennemi va tomber !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00338=Les flammes vont vous consumer !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00339=Le temps… s’enfuit…
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00340=Héros, la nuit va tomber dans quelques instants… J’espère que vous êtes prêts.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00341=La nuit tombe, héros. J’adore contempler mon jardin à la lueur de la lune.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00342=La nuit tombe à nouveau, et bientôt les traîne-racines ressortiront de terre.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00343=La nuit va tomber, héros. Souvenez-vous : tuez les traîne-racines et récupérez leurs graines.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00344=La nuit tombera dans 30 secondes. Vous êtes prêts à vous amuser un peu ?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00345=Les traîne-racines se réveillent ! Tuez-les… Récupérez leurs graines.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00346=Les traîne-racines se réveillent… Tuez-les et récupérez leurs graines.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00347=Il est temps… Faites ce que vous avez à faire.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00348=Les traîne-racines sont de retour. Libérez mes graines, héros.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00349=Massacrez-les tous. Reprenez mes graines !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00350=La lueur de l’aurore… Dépêchez-vous, héros.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00351=L’aube se lève… Notre temps est quasiment écoulé.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00352=De la lumière. Le jour vient.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00353=<angry exertion>Misérable soleil... Récupérez mes graines, vite...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00358=Vous avez assez de graines ! Apportez-les-moi... Je vais remédier à la faiblesse de vos chairs...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00359=Enfin, vous avez assez de graines. Venez… Vous allez devenir la fierté de mon jardin.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00360=Plantez ces graines dans ma terre… et gorgez-vous de la terreur de vos ennemis.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00361=Plantez les graines, héros.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00362=Venez planter ces graines maintenant.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00363=Ne m’énervez pas. Plantez les graines… utilisez mon pouvoir.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00364=Venez sur la terre fertile… Plantez les graines.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00365=Plantez les graines, créatures de chair.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00366=Votre terreur a pris vie ! Allez ! Faites votre moisson de cadavres ennemis.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00367=Excellent. Avancez. Déracinez les forts ennemis.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00368=Debout, ma terreur ! Va boire la sève de tes ennemis !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00369=Vos ennemis cultivent une terreur.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00370=La terreur de vos ennemis est florissante.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00371=Vos ennemis font pousser une terreur.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00372=Votre terreur a pris vie.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00373=Enfin, votre terreur est vivante.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00374=Votre terreur fleurit. Priez pour qu’elle soit plus forte que celle de votre ennemi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00375=La terreur de vos ennemis a fleuri.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00376=On dirait que votre ennemi a désormais sa propre terreur !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00377=Héros, vos ennemis ont fait pousser une terreur !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00378=Non, ma délicieuse terreur a succombé.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00379=Votre terreur est tombée. Vous êtes à nouveau réduits à la chair et aux os.

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00420=Ça me peine de vous l’annoncer, mais vos ennemis ont fait pousser une terreur.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00421=Une terreur vient de pousser pour vos ennemis, héros.

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00423=Je pense que cette terreur devrait arriver à point nommé.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00424=Votre terreur a poussé. Je me demande si elle est plus forte que celle de vos ennemis.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00425=Héros, votre ennemi a aussi créé une terreur !
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00426=Oh oh. On dirait que vos ennemis ont désormais leur propre terreur !

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00452=Trop tard, héros. Vous avez rejeté mon cadeau… Que ce refus vous soit fatal.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00453=Vous laisseriez ma terreur pourrir sur pied ? Quel stupide gâchis.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00454=Votre terreur s’est fanée… Un beau gâchis.

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00457=Récoltez le fruit de vos efforts, héros. Donnez vie à ma terreur.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00459=Ne faites qu’un avec votre terreur. Croyez-moi, c’est follement amusant.

Conversation/GoblinVO/Line00004=J’aurais dû me douter que cet endroit attirerait les forces du mal. Ce gobelin au trésor transporte de l’or, mais vous n’êtes pas le genre à lui faire de mal, n’est-ce pas ?

Conversation/GoblinVO/Line00010=Restez un instant, puis allez tuer ce gobelin au trésor.
Conversation/GoblinVO/Line00011=C’est bien regrettable que ces gobelins refusent toujours de rester un instant et de m’écouter !
Conversation/GoblinVO/Line00012=Ah ! C’est encore vous… J’imagine que vous êtes là pour aider vos « amis » à tuer le gobelin au trésor ?
Conversation/GoblinVO/Line00013=Félicitations, héros ! L’or du gobelin est à vous.
Conversation/GoblinVO/Line00014=C’était rondement mené ! Profitez de votre juste récompense, héros.

Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00045=Votre golem est plus faible que celui de votre adversaire. Préparez vos défenses.

Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00064=Accrochez-vous, on sera bientôt à tombeau ouvert.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00065=Accrochez-vous, on sera bientôt à tombeau ouvert.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00066=Les golems se réveillent… Mais soyez prudent, le vôtre est beaucoup plus faible que celui de votre adversaire.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00067=Il va vous falloir davantage de crânes, si vous voulez un golem plus puissant.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00068=Votre golem est plus faible que celui de votre adversaire. Préparez vos défenses.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00069=Un golem faible. Récoltez davantage de crânes, héros.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00070=Les golems revivent… Le vôtre est beaucoup plus puissant.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00071=Bien joué. Votre golem est bien plus puissant que celui de votre adversaire.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00072=La création est terminée. Votre golem surpasse celui de vos adversaires.
Conversation/HauntedMines/Line00073=Votre golem est plus fort que celui de vos adversaires. Profitez-en.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00005=Le Nexus ? C’est donc une sorte de truc protoss ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00006=Quoi ? Non, c’est… Écoute…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00007=Le Nexus est une tempête cosmique où les mondes entrent en collision à travers l’espace, le temps et même les dimensions. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00008=Tu as été invoqué ici pour faire tes preuves au combat et te couvrir de gloire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00009=La gloire, ouais ? Non... Pas besoin de me convaincre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00010=Ce portail des tempêtes nous conduira jusqu’à la cour du Corbeau. Fais un clic droit pour y aller.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00014=Je n’en doute pas, l’ami, mais les choses sont différentes ici, donc mieux vaut apprendre cela maintenant !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00015=Un serviteur ennemi ? Nous venons à peine d’arriver… Bon, appuie sur la touche Q, puis clique sur lui pour l’attaquer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00017=Un serviteur ennemi ? Nous venons à peine d’arriver… Bon, appuie sur la touche d’attaque, puis clique sur lui pour l’attaquer.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00030=Le Nexus est une tempête cosmique où les mondes entrent en collision à travers l’espace, le temps et même les dimensions. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00031=Nous sommes de plus en plus nombreux à être appelés dans cet énigmatique royaume, pour tester notre force lors de combats contre d’autres héros de mérite équivalent.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00032=Donc, je suis ici pour me battre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00033=Et te couvrir de gloire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00034=Okay. Pas besoin de me faire un dessin… Allons-y.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00035=Diablo ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00036=Vous osez vous opposer au seigneur de la Terreur ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00037=Je me demande… Quel goût a ta peur, mortel ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00038=Qu’est-ce que j’en sais ? Je suis même pas sûr que tu puisses sentir quoi que ce soit…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00039=Je vais te dévorer !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00040=Ouais, il cherche pas vraiment à faire bonne impression… Je vais lui apprendre les bonnes manières.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00041=Va falloir m’affranchir, qu’est-ce qui se passe ici ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00042=Ce royaume se nomme la cour du Corbeau… et il est assiégé par le seigneur démon Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00043=Les capacités s’affichent sur la barre d’actions en bas de ton écran.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00044=Pour affronter Diablo, tu auras besoin de tirer le meilleur parti de tes capacités.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00045=Tout d’abord, essaie ta Balle perforante contre les soldats morts-vivants de Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00046=Tout d’abord, essaie ta Balle perforante contre les serviteurs de Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00047=Patience, jeune homme. Vise avec soin et recommence.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00048=Appuie sur la touche A, puis place ton viseur sur les squelettes. Une fois prêt, clique pour tirer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00050=Active ta capacité Balle perforante, puis place la flèche de ciblage sur les squelettes. Une fois prêt, clique pour tirer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00051=Le clic droit annule une capacité. Quand la flèche de ciblage est active, il suffit de cliquer pour tirer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00053=Appuie sur la touche A, puis place ton viseur sur les ennemis. Une fois prêt, clique pour tirer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00055=Active Balle perforante, puis place la flèche de ciblage sur les ennemis. Une fois prêt, clique pour tirer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00056=Une fois la touche A enfoncée, place ton viseur sur les ennemis et clique pour tirer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00058=Une fois Balle perforante activée, place la flèche de ciblage sur les ennemis, puis clique pour tirer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00059=Appuie sur la touche A, vise les ennemis, puis clique pour tirer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00061=Active Balle perforante, place la flèche de ciblage sur les ennemis, puis clique pour tirer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00062=Très bien ! Utiliser tes capacités te permet d’infliger plus de dégâts que tes attaques de base.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00063=D’autres squelettes t’attendent plus loin. Utilise ta Balle perforante pour les vaincre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00064=D’autres serviteurs t’attendent plus loin. Utilise ta Balle perforante pour les vaincre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00065=Joli tir, mon garçon !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00066=Je te suggère d’essayer un de ces quatre, Uther. C’est beaucoup plus efficace que frapper des mecs avec ce foutu marteau.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00067=N’oublie pas : tu peux utiliser Balle perforante pour tuer des groupes de serviteurs d’un seul coup.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00068=Il y a trop de squelettes devant nous… Nous devons battre en retraite.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00069=Ouh là, ça sent pas bon. Les gars se découragent.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00070=Ta capacité Inspiration te donne du courage, ainsi vous attaquerez plus vite.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00071=Tu dois inspirer ces fantassins et continuer le combat !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00072=Je me sens invincible ! À l’attaque !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00073=Sois pas trop sûr de toi, petit…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00074=Ta capacité Inspiration augmente ta vitesse d’attaque ainsi que celle de tes alliés proches. Utilise-la dès que tu le peux.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00075=Ta capacité Inspiration augmente ton efficacité ainsi que celle de tes alliés proches. Utilise-la dès que tu le peux.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00076=N’oublie pas : ta balle perforante peut tuer des groupes de squelettes pendant que tes serviteurs combattent.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00077=Inspirer tes serviteurs te permettra de vaincre les squelettes plus vite.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00078=Votre courage retrouvé ne vous sauvera pas. Vos vies insignifiantes s’arrêtent ici.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00079=Nos fantassins affrontent Diablo un peu plus loin. Débloque la caméra pour jeter un œil.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00080=Maintenant, fais défiler la carte et voyons ce que mijote Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00081=Brûlez dans les feux des Enfers !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00082=Il est blessé ! C’est le moment d’attaquer !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00083=Appuie sur la touche Espace pour recentrer la caméra sur toi à tout instant.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00084=Recentre la caméra sur toi, et mettons-nous au travail !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00085=Si tu préfères reverrouiller la caméra, appuie à nouveau sur la touche L.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00086=Si tu préfères, tu peux toujours reverrouiller la caméra.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00087=Ce royaume et toutes les âmes fourvoyées qui s’y trouvent seront bientôt à moi !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00088=Droit dans le mur.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00089=Diablo est brutal. Utilise ta Balle perforante pour le repousser.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00090=Je pourchasserai ton âme à tout jamais, James Raynor.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00091=Bien joué, jeune homme ! Mais ce n’est pas encore terminé.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00092=Utilise ta pierre de foyer pour me rejoindre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00093=Reste immobile pour que la magie de la pierre de foyer fonctionne.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00094=(siffle) Comme c’est mignon…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00095=C’est le hall des Tempêtes. Les héros apparaissent ici quand le match commence.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00096=Notre but est de détruire l’idole ennemie tout en protégeant la nôtre des attaques adverses.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00097=Les deux idoles invoquent des serviteurs qui suivent cette voie et s’affrontent lors d’innombrables vagues de combat.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00098=Pigé. On détruit l’idole de Diablo et le combat sera terminé… C’est simple. Mais rappelle-moi pourquoi on fait ça, déjà ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00099=Tu sais… tu ne devrais pas trop réfléchir à ce genre de choses…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00100=Tout d’abord, dirige-toi vers la ligne de front.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00101=Balaf’ vouloir jouer !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00102=Celui-ci n’est pas très avisé… Attaquer un fort seul est quasiment du suicide.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00103=Nos serviteurs nous aident à progresser vers l’idole ennemie. Reste derrière eux et laisse-les encaisser les dégâts.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00104=Attention ! N’attaque les tours que lorsqu’elles sont occupées à combattre quelqu’un d’autre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00105=Bien joué, mon garçon ! Tu as fait la preuve de ta valeur.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00106=Que dire, à part que je suis vraiment doué pour faire exploser des trucs ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00107=Des serviteurs et de la pierre, ce n’est pas un vrai défi ! Maintenant, je vais me repaître de votre terreur !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00108=« Te repaître de ma terreur ? » C’est bon, là, ça fait deux fois... On ne peut pas manger la terreur.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00109=Hmm ! Lui raison. Pas manger terreur.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00110=Tu vois ? Même Schlingo a pigé.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00111=Assez !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00112=Une minute. Je viens pas de mourir, là ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00113=Ne t’inquiète pas, dans le Nexus, la mort n’est qu’un léger contretemps. Au bout d’un moment, tu ressuscites, prêt à combattre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00114=J’espère que ça ne te dérange pas que je t’accompagne ? Cela devrait équilibrer un peu la partie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00115=Pas du tout… Allons-y, partenaire !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00116=Enfourche ta monture et retourne au combat.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00117=Pour retourner au front plus vite, utilise ta monture.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00118=Pour descendre de ta monture, appuie à nouveau sur le bouton.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00119=Sois prudent. Je ne serai pas toujours là pour t’aider.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00120=Attention, jeune homme. Je viens encore de te sauver.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00121=Ramasse des globes pour récupérer des points de vie et de mana.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00122=Les tours ennemies font très mal, mais elles tirent sur les serviteurs avant de s’en prendre aux héros.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00123=N’attaque une tour que lorsque nos serviteurs sont à proximité.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00124=Fuyons, vite ! Nous reviendrons quand nous aurons des serviteurs pour nous protéger !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00125=Reste derrière tes serviteurs et laisse-les subir les dégâts.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00126=N’oublie pas d’utiliser Balle perforante et Inspiration pour te charger de tes ennemis plus efficacement.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00127=Si tu oublies un raccourci, tu le retrouveras en haut à gauche de l’écran.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00128=Parfait ! Il ne reste plus que l’idole ennemie !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00129=Hé, tu as autre chose à dire, bouche en feu ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00130=J’aurai ma vengeance, James Raynor. Ce n’est pas terminé !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00131=Eh, c’est pas un combat à la loyale !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00132=Vous ne combattrez pas seul !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00133=Eh bien, regardez qui le Nexus nous a ramené… Ça fait plaisir de te voir, cowboy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00134=Nova ? Maintenant, je commence à me sentir à la maison.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00135=Te mets pas trop à l’aise… Ça risque de secouer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00136=Ah ah. J’adore ça, quand ça secoue.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00137=Allez, la grande rouge, montre-nous ce que tu vaux ! Je suis prêt pour le deuxième round.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00138=<Roar>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00139=J’espère que tu es prêt, Raynor. On entre dans le vif du sujet !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00140=J’étais prêt en venant au monde, Uther…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00141=N’oublie pas que si tu es blessé, tu peux revenir dans notre hall des Tempêtes et tes blessures seront progressivement guéries.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00142=Le but est là encore de combattre l’équipe adverse et de détruire son idole.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00143=Voilà comment je vois ça : il y a trois voies en direction de la base ennemie. Donc, il nous faut quelqu’un sur chacune d’entre elles.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00144=Maintenant, tu sais tout. Suis-moi et prépare-toi à te battre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00145=Quand tu tues des serviteurs, des héros ou des bâtiments ennemis, ton équipe gagne de l’expérience.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00146=L’expérience obtenue est partagée par tous, et tout ce que tu fais contribue au succès de notre équipe.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00147=L’expérience et le niveau actuel des deux équipes sont indiqués ici.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00148=Quand la barre bleue est remplie, notre équipe gagne un niveau et nous devenons plus forts.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00149=Allons gagner un niveau alors.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00150=Beau travail, nous avons gagné un niveau !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00151=Tes statistiques ont augmenté et tes capacités sont devenues plus puissantes.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00152=Ça a l’air super utile. Tu as autre chose d’intéressant ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00153=Les niveaux débloquent aussi des talents pour personnaliser tes capacités et modifier ta façon de combattre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00154=Hé, pas mal ! Je me sens déjà plus fort.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00155=Tu viens de débloquer ta capacité héroïque. Elle peut renverser le cours du combat. Utilise-la à bon escient.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00156=Une capacité héroïque, hein ? J’ai hâte de l’essayer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00157=Bon sang, c’est pas la grande forme.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00158=Mieux vaut te rendre à une fontaine de soins. Fais un clic droit dessus pour récupérer de la vie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00159=Mieux vaut te rendre à une fontaine de soins. Clique dessus pour récupérer des points de vie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00160=Mieux vaut te rendre à une fontaine de soins. Clique dessus pour récupérer de la vie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00161=Bien, après avoir bu à une fontaine de soins, tu récupères tes points de vie et de mana sur la durée.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00162=Mais tu devras attendre que la fontaine se remplisse complètement avant de pouvoir boire une nouvelle fois.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00163=Raynor, recule !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00164=Faut que je m’éloigne.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00165=Raynor, ton aide nous serait utile par ici. Nous allons « encourager » ces géants de siège à se joindre à nous.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00166=Encourager ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00167=Oh, c’est plus marrant que ça en a l’air. Crois-moi sur parole… <reload sound>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00168=Reste près de cette balise un instant, veux-tu ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00169=Nous y voilà. Une fois un camp de mercenaires vaincu, ces derniers se joignent à nous et combattent sur la voie la plus proche.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00170=Très bien, escortons ces créatures de siège jusqu’au fort ennemi et mettons-le en pièces.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00171=Les géants de siège sont plutôt efficaces pour détruire des forts à distance.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00172=Raynor, nous avons besoin de renforts. Essaye de vaincre seul un camp de mercenaires.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00173=N’oublie pas de te servir de tes capacités pour les vaincre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00175=Raynor, dirige-toi vers cette tour de guet. Si tu t’en empares, tu auras une vision étendue de cette zone.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00176=Reste là un moment pour que la tour de guet s’active.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00177=Recule, mon garçon. Il est dangereux d’attaquer une tour sans nos serviteurs.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00178=Sois prudent, il n’y a aucun serviteur pour te protéger de cette tour.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00179=Dépêche-toi. On a besoin de ton aide avec ces géants de siège.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00180=J’imagine que je devrais aller aider Uther avant que le vieux ne devienne encore plus grincheux.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00181=Raynor, j’aurais bien besoin de ton aide sur cette voie.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00182=Note à moi-même : je devrais utiliser ces capacités plus souvent.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00183=Tu es mal en point, tu devrais utiliser une fontaine de soins.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00184=Tu es à court de mana. Tu peux boire à une fontaine de soins ou utiliser ta pierre de foyer pour retourner à la base et laisser tes points de vie et de mana se reconstituer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00185=Ça vaudrait le coup de s’emparer d’un camp de mercenaires.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00186=Quasiment plus de vie et la fontaine est à sec. Je vais utiliser cette pierre de foyer pour me soigner à la base.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00187=Pour retourner au front plus vite, utilise ta monture.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00188=Pour te déplacer plus rapidement, utilise ta monture. Le raccourci par défaut est W.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00189=Pas le temps de traîner, marshal. Choisis ta voie et prépare-toi au combat.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00190=Enfin, un globe de régénération ! J’en ai bien besoin.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00191=N’oublie pas de choisir un talent, mon garçon.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00192=L’ennemi a pris notre tour de guet. Nous devrions essayer de la reprendre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00193=Une Balle perforante neutraliserait ce groupe d’ennemis en un clin d’œil.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00194=Raynor, utilise ta capacité Inspiration pour renforcer nos attaques !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00195=Le clic droit annule une capacité. Il faut cliquer normalement pour activer une capacité.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00197=Tu viens d’annuler une capacité. Fais attention à utiliser le bon bouton de la souris pour utiliser Balle perforante.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00198=Le clic droit annule une capacité. Fais un clic gauche pour invoquer l’Hypérion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00200=Tu viens d’annuler une capacité. Fais attention à utiliser le bon bouton de la souris pour appeler l’Hypérion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00201=Quand tes points de vie sont bas, tu peux boire à une fontaine de soins ou retourner avec ta pierre de foyer à la base où tu seras progressivement soigné.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00202=Prends ton temps. Te faire tuer en chargeant l'ennemi quand ta vie est faible lui confère de l’expérience et prive notre équipe d’un de ses membres.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00203=Utilise ta pierre de foyer pour retourner à ton idole mais assure-toi avant d’être loin des ennemis ou d’être bien caché.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00204=Hé ! J’étais en train d’utiliser ma pierre de foyer !
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00205=L’incantation de la pierre de foyer est lente, et elle est interrompue en cas d’attaque. Ne l’utilise que si tu es hors de danger.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00206=C’est le bon moment pour appeler l’Hypérion à la rescousse.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00207=Je parie que si j’appelle l’Hypérion, on pourra se débarrasser de ces mecs.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00208=Et tu es censé être quoi ? Une espèce de chevalier ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00209=Un paladin, en fait.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00210=Tu cherches la petite bête, non ?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00211=Non, en fait, un paladin manipule le pouvoir de…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00212=Je t’arrête direct, mon gars. J’ai pas vraiment envie de savoir…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00213=Je suis vraiment content de te voir, Nova.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00214=J’aimerais pouvoir te répondre la même chose, cowboy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00215=Hé, Diablo… <bruit de bise> C’est pas TA peur que je sens ?

Conversation/Spooky18/Line00001=Généraux, mettez-vous en marche et tuez en mon nom ! Le seigneur corbeau vous l’ordonne.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00002=La crête des Rois tombera. Puisse sa chute servir de leçon à tous ceux qui s’opposent au seigneur corbeau.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00003=Ce misérable royaume ne peut rien contre la puissance du seigneur corbeau.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00004=Zarya, mon fidèle chevalier fantôme, purifiez ce royaume par le feu impie !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00005=Vous pensez être de taille à affronter mes généraux ? Ne soyez pas ridicules…
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00006=Qui a osé s’en prendre à mon chevalier fantôme ? Ah, c’est vous. J’aurais dû m’en douter.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00007=L’un de mes généraux a été vaincu… Ne vous avisez pas de jouer avec mes nerfs.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00008=Le wyrm spectral Alexstrasza, Aspect de la Non-mort, se dresse contre vous.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00009=Aspect de la Non-mort, le seigneur corbeau t’appelle !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00010=Comment avez-vous réussi à tuer celle qui n’a pas d’essence vitale ?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00011=Le wyrm spectral n’est plus ? C’est loin d’être la fin.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00012=Sorcière du Val, il est temps de punir ce royaume !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00013=La crête des Rois sera punie pour son ingérence.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00014=Soyez maudits !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00015=Pourquoi refusez-vous de mourir ?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00016=Gardienne araignée, je t’ai trouvé une proie.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00017=Traquez mes ennemis, général. Et n’ayez aucune pitié.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00018=La chasse est finie, mais la guerre se poursuit.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00019=Ainsi… vous avez tué votre poursuivante… La plaisanterie a assez duré !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00020=Pensiez-vous pouvoir vous en tirer aussi facilement ?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00021=Ainsi, vous avez vaincu mes généraux. Voyons si vous ferez aussi bien contre le chevalier dragon.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00022=Savourez votre piètre victoire, héros. Il ne reste plus rien de la crête des Rois !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00023=Quelle victoire, héros ! Vous voilà champions d’un royaume à l’agonie !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00024=Vous pensez avoir un coup d’avance, c’est ça ?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00025=Une relique du passé…
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00026=Pff. Profitez bien de votre relique sans valeur.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00027=Quelle perte de temps !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00031=J’en ai assez.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00032=Comment osez-vous défier le seigneur corbeau ?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00033=Non…
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00034=Vous avez perdu ma faveur… C’est le moins qu’on puisse dire.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00035=Vous avez peut-être affaibli mes troupes, mais nul ne peut s’opposer à mon courroux !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00036=La crête des Rois abdiquera cette nuit. Tels sont les mots du seigneur corbeau !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00037=Héros, prenez les armes et venez à bout des serviteurs du seigneur corbeau !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00038=Aujourd’hui, le seigneur corbeau connaîtra la défaite. La crête des Rois triomphera !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00039=C’en est fini du règne de terreur du seigneur corbeau. Je ne tolérerai plus ses forfaits !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00040=Le chevalier fantôme du seigneur corbeau cherche à réduire mon royaume en cendres. Calmez ses ardeurs.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00041=Cette armure vide appartient à un général du seigneur corbeau. Nous la briserons, tout comme son maître.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00042=Ce n’est pas un fantôme qui viendra à bout d’un chevalier de la crête des Rois.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00043=Ne vous en faites pas, seigneur corbeau. Vous ne tarderez pas à rejoindre votre chevalier fantôme.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00044=Le seigneur corbeau a le culot de s’en prendre à la crête des Rois avec un dragon ! Quel pauvre sot.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00045=Autrefois une noble créature, le wyrm spectral sert désormais un ignoble maître. Libérez son esprit.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00046=Puisse la mort libérer l’âme de ce dragon.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00047=La crête des Rois appartient aux vivants. La non-mort n’a pas sa place ici.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00048=Je n’aurai de cesse que votre règne prenne fin, seigneur corbeau.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00049=La sorcière du Val a conclu un sombre marché pour obtenir ses pouvoirs, mais rien dont notre acier ne puisse venir à bout.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00050=Cette sorcière cherche à nous « punir ». Montrez-lui le véritable sens de ce mot.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00051=Plus jamais ses maléfices ne profaneront mon royaume.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00052=C’en est fini de votre malédiction… et de votre sorcière.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00053=Le seigneur corbeau a lancé sa gardienne araignée à nos trousses. Mais nous ne sommes pas des proies.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00054=La prédatrice s’apercevra bientôt qu’elle est la proie.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00055=Nous l’avons écrasée comme un vulgaire insecte.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00056=Tissez autant de toiles que vous le souhaitez. Je les détruirai toutes.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00057=Le seigneur dragon a été corrompu ? Vous paierez pour ce blasphème, seigneur corbeau !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00058=Non… mon bien aimé… C’en est trop ! Héros, vous savez ce qui doit être fait !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00059=Tout cela était-il vain ?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00060=Quand bien même la malédiction m’emporte, la crête des Rois… vaincra…
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00061=La crête des Rois triomphera du Noir Nexus !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00062=S’attaquer à mon royaume était une grave erreur, seigneur corbeau.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00063=Vos exploits feront écho à travers les âges, héros.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00064=De telles monstruosités ne peuvent venir à bout de nos valeureuses troupes !
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00065=Je ne suis pas étrangère à la perte et à la souffrance. Le Seigneur corbeau fera bientôt leur connaissance.

Conversation/Toy18/Line00001=Oui, un nouvel ami ! Tu veux jouer à un jeu que j’ai inventé ? Il est trop génial… Tu vas l’adorer !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00002=Voilà le plateau de jeu. Et ça, c’est ton pion… mais y a aussi un dé… et des cartes… et aussi des autocollants… Ouah, j’ai trop hâte de commencer la partie !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00003=Le but du jeu, c’est de faire le tour du plateau en faisant des quêtes et en gagnant des super récompenses. Allez, vas-y, lance le dé !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00004=Ouaiiis, pas mal. Bon, quand tu arrives sur une case, tu dois faire ce que dit la carte de quête !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00005=Bon, quand tu arrives sur une case, tu dois faire ce que dit la carte de quête !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00006=T’as terminé une quête ! Du coup, tu gagnes un autocollant ! Quand t’as gagné trois autocollants, t’obtiens un coffre de « trucs secrets ». Même moi, je sais pas ce qu’y a dedans…
Conversation/Toy18/Line00007=C’est la quête de Méphisto… Tiens, c’est quoi, ça ? C’est Balafré ? Non mais franchement ? Il veut qu’on le recouse ou quelque chose dans le genre ? C’est… un peu bizarre, mais fais-le et on verra bien, d’accord ?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00008=J’ai toujours adoré ce gros lard ! Quelqu’un sait où Méphisto est passé ?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00009=Oh oooh. Quelqu’un s’est assis sur… Euh, je veux dire, quelqu’un a cassé l’écurie de la licorne. Ta quête, c’est de récolter des matériaux pour en construire une nouvelle.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00010=Quête terminée ! Voici ta récompense, héros ! Je vais prendre ces matériaux… Super, maintenant, où j’ai mis la colle ?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00011=Oh, une quête spéciale ! Mon Dehaka a été, euh… blessé. Tu dois récolter des pièces sur d’autres jouets, ça permettra de le réparer. Enfin, j’espère.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00012=Wouah, t’as vraiment réussi ? Il est réparé ? J’y crois pas ! Je veux dire, euh… Merci d’avoir fait cette quête. Tiens, je te donne ça.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00013=Oh nooon, les piles du lion sont mortes. Et je ne sais pas comment on les recharge ! On pourrait peut-être lui donner des serviteurs à manger, ou quelque chose comme ça ? Ça devrait lui rendre de l’énergie ! Bon… essaie de trouver une solution, d’accord ?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00014=J’en reviens pas ! Ça a marché ! Enfin… évidemment que ça a marché ! On fait une super équipe, tope-là !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00015=Hem… Pas la peine de mentir. Je… j’ai peut-être bien cassé la Valeera de ma sœur. Ses armes se sont détachées… Il faut que tu la répares sinon je vais passer un mauvais quart d’heure. Allez, vas-y ! T’as une nouvelle quête ! Dépêche-toi !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00016=T’as réussi ! Oh, merci ! Tu me sauves la vie ! Ça aurait pu finir vachement plus mal. Prends ça, d’accord ?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00017=Ouah ! T’as réparé tous mes jouets ! Enfin, t’as surtout gagné la partie, je veux dire ! Ça fait de toi mon nouveau meilleur ami. Tiens, prends ça et si t’as envie de rejouer, t’as qu’à demander !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00018=Ouah, t’as encore fini un tour entier du plateau de jeu ? Bien joué ! T’assures !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00019=Ah… tu joues encore. Mais tu vas pas y passer la nuit. À un moment, je reprendrai mon plateau de jeu !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00020=Bien joué ! Tiens, voilà encore un coffre mystère. J’espère que ce qu’il y a dedans te plaira !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00021=Je commence à croire que ce jeu est pas assez difficile. Je devrais sans doute multiplier la difficulté par 200…
Conversation/Toy18/Line00022=Nouvelle victoire, nouvelle récompense !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00023=Continue comme ça et j’aurai plus rien à te donner en récompense. J’aurais dû prévoir ça aussi… rhah.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00024=Encore toi ? OK… Les récompenses sont quelque part par là… je crois.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00025=Félicitations, héros, vous avez terminé le jeu ! Oh, une minute… c’est encore toi. Je croyais que c’était un nouveau joueur… Bon ben… bien joué quand même !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00026=C’est une fête rien que pour toi ! Allez, on s’amuse !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00027=T’es très fort à ce jeu ! Peut-être trop fort, en fait.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00028=Hé, t’es pas censé faire ça ! C’est mon jeu, c’est moi qui fais les règles ! J’ajoute une nouvelle règle : interdit de faire ça. D’accord ?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00029=C’est pas du jeu ! T’as triché !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00030=C’est pas écrit dans les règles ! Et si ça y est, je vais le retirer !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00031=Hé, arrête de faire ça ! Mais arrête !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00032=Continue comme ça et je reprends mes jouets.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00033=Ouah, je savais pas que tu pouvais faire ça ! c’était trop génial !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00034=Comment t’as fait ça ? Vas-y, refais-le !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00035=C’est trop bien !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00036=T’es bien meilleur à ce jeu que tous les autres joueurs !
Conversation/Toy18/Line00037=J’y crois pas ! Je viens de le voir, mais j’y crois quand même pas.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00038=Tu l’as terminé dix fois ? T’es mille fois plus fort que tous mes autres jouets… Je veux dire, mes autres amis… Enfin, tu vois ce que je veux dire… ha ha… ha.

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed00=L’aube viendra.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed01=L’unité fait la force.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed02=Ce royaume pose de nombreuses questions et donne peu de réponses...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed03=Les Xel’Naga sont-ils impliqués dans la création du Nexus ? Si c’est le cas, ils n’ont laissé ni temples... ni nouvelles formes de vie...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed04=À moins qu’elles soient cachées... nous contrôlant par le biais d’une sorte de mécanisme numérique complexe.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed05=Peut-être même sont-elles des milliers, manipulant nos vies toutes en même temps ?! Aaah... Tout ça me donne la migraine.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed06=Je me demande ce que font les Daelaam en mon absence. J’espère qu’ils n’ont pas déplacé tous les meubles dans ma salle du conseil. Je déteste quand ils font ça.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed07=Donc, la Lance d’Adun est juste au-dessus de moi... mais le forge-phase Karax n’est nulle part ?<sigh>Normal.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed08=Vous allez arrêter de me donner des coups ? Allez plutôt agresser un des orcs ! Vous verrez bien si ça lui fait plaisir !
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed09=Je maintiens que StarCraft n’est pas juste un Warcraft dans l’espace... Et ce Heroes of the Storm, ça n’a juste rien à voir.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed10=Oui, mes vaisseaux me suivent où que j’aille. C’est un peu comme ce que vous les terrans appelez un animal de compagnie, en plus utile.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed11=J’ai été promu hiérarque il y a peu, mais je suis encore en train de réfléchir à mon évolution de carrière. Avec un peu de chance, je deviendrai archiarque en un rien temps.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed12=Que pensez-vous de ma nouvelle armure ? L’ancienne me... moulait un peu trop.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed13=Je ne suis jeune que pour les Protoss. J’ai vécu deux siècles de plus que vous et j’apprécierais un peu de respect.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed14= Je suis pas super fort, je suis mieux que ça même, je suis surpuissant.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected00=On m’accorde un sursis.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected01=Mes remerciements.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive00=Nous devons ne faire qu’un.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive01=Je n’échouerai pas.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec00=Une sage décision.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec01=Je suis intrigué.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec02=Ah, c’est ça le plan...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec03=Stratégique.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec04=Ça me sera très utile.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt00=Vous vous comportez comme si vous veniez d’une civilisation moins... avancée.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt01=Si votre bêtise ne vous tue pas, mes lames le feront.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt02=Ma méditation est terminée. Avez-vous seulement commencé la vôtre ?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/TeamKilled00=Les heures sombres vont s’achever.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExLocked00=Nous devons avancer ensemble pour réussir.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Harak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Gift00=Je vous offre mon aide avec joie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Lockin00=Notre heure est venue.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Purchase00=Nous combattons pour la même cause !
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial00=Même les templiers doivent s’entraîner.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial01=J’aime les défis.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Nous devons tous peser nos actes dans ce royaume.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Je vois que vous n’agissez pas sans réfléchir. J’admire cela.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=L’heure de la contemplation est terminée.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Les combats ont commencé. Il ne faut pas tarder !

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Nous réglerons cela après le combat, abomination.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Kill00=Vous n’avez pas d’honneur.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Kill01=Quelle déception.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Kill02=Vous ne faites pas le poids face aux lames d’un templier.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Kill03=Ceux qui sont divisés meurent.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Kill04=Une forme de vie inférieure.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/KillKerrigan00=Ça, c’était pour Fénix !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/KillProtoss00=Vous auriez dû me rejoindre dans l’unité.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/KillRaynor00=J’en suis désolé, ami Raynor.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/KillSpreeEnd00=J’en avais assez de vous !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/KillTassadar00=On dirait que je vous ai surpassé, mentor.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/KillZeratul00=Puisse Adun vous cacher la prochaine fois.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/KillZerg00=Je purgerai cette galaxie de votre espèce.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Laugh00=<bemused laugh>
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/LowLifeHeal00=Exactement comme les vents astraux...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/LowLifeHeal01=Je me souviendrai de ce geste.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/LowLifeHeal02=Votre soutien est vital, mon ami.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/LowMana00=Je n’ai plus beaucoup de mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/LowMana01=Je n’ai plus beaucoup de mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/LowMana02=Il me faut plus de mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/No00=Non.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/No01=Ce n’est pas possible.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/No02=Impossible.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_AssistHero00=Notre allié a besoin de nous.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_AssistMe00=Venez m’aider !

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_AttackCastle00=Détruisez l’idole de notre ennemi !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_AttackMerc00=Capturons ce camp de mercenaires.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Faites des ruines de ce fort !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_AttackTower00=Nous devons nous emparer de cette tour.

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Notre fort a besoin de renforts !

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ping_KillHero00=Tuez cet adversaire, vite !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed00=L’aube viendra.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed01=L’unité fait la force.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed02=Ce royaume pose de nombreuses questions et donne peu de réponses...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed03=Les Xel’Naga sont-ils impliqués dans la création du Nexus ? Si c’est le cas, ils n’ont laissé ni temples... ni nouvelles formes de vie...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed04=À moins qu’elles soient cachées... nous contrôlant par le biais d’une sorte de mécanisme numérique complexe.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed05=Peut-être même sont-elles des milliers, manipulant nos vies toutes en même temps ?! Aaah... Tout ça me donne la migraine.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed06=Je me demande ce que font les Daelaam en mon absence. J’espère qu’ils n’ont pas déplacé tous les meubles dans ma salle du conseil. Je déteste quand ils font ça.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed07=Donc, la Lance d’Adun est juste au-dessus de moi... mais le forge-phase Karax n’est nulle part ?<sigh>Normal. Au moins, il ne m’ennuie pas avec sa solarite...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed08=Donc, la Lance d’Adun est juste au-dessus de moi... mais le forge-phase Karax n’est nulle part ?<sigh>Normal.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed09=Vous allez arrêter de me donner des coups ? Allez plutôt agresser un des orcs ! Vous verrez bien si ça lui fait plaisir !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed10=Je maintiens que StarCraft n’est pas juste un Warcraft dans l’espace... Et ce Heroes of the Storm, ça n’a juste rien à voir.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed11=Oui, mes vaisseaux me suivent où que j’aille. C’est un peu comme ce que vous les terrans appelez un animal de compagnie, en plus utile.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed12=J’ai été promu hiérarque il y a peu, mais je suis encore en train de réfléchir à mon évolution de carrière. Avec un peu de chance, je deviendrai archiarque en un rien temps.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed13=Que pensez-vous de ma nouvelle armure ? L’ancienne me... moulait un peu trop.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed14=Je ne suis jeune que pour les Protoss. J’ai vécu deux siècles de plus que vous et j’apprécierais un peu de respect.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed15= Je suis pas super fort, je suis mieux que ça même, je suis surpuissant.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected00=On m’accorde un sursis.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected01=Mes remerciements.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Revive00=Nous devons ne faire qu’un.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Revive01=Je n’échouerai pas.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec00=Une sage décision.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec01=Je suis intrigué.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec02=Ah, c’est ça le plan...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec03=Stratégique.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec04=Cela me sera très utile.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt00=Vous vous comportez comme si vous veniez d’une civilisation moins... avancée.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt01=Si votre bêtise ne vous tue pas, mes lames le feront.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt02=Ma méditation est terminée. Avez-vous seulement commencé la vôtre ?
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/TeamKilled00=Les heures sombres vont s’achever.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_ExLocked00=Nous devons avancer ensemble pour réussir.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_ExPurchased00=Harak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Gift00=Je vous offre mon aide avec joie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Lockin00=Notre heure est venue.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Purchase00=Nous combattons pour la même cause !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial00=Même les templiers doivent s’entraîner.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial01=J’aime les défis.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked00=Nous devons tous peser nos actes dans ce royaume.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked01=Je vois que vous n’agissez pas sans réfléchir. J’admire cela.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased00=L’heure de la contemplation est terminée.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased01=Les combats ont commencé. Il ne faut pas tarder !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used00=Lance d’Adun, feu !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used01=Activation du rayon purificateur !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used02=Je commence la purification.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate2Used00=Je les ai privés de la vue !
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate2Used01=Contemplez la puissance d’une arche !

VoiceOver/Arthas/Pissed07=Vous n’avez jamais eu l’impression de revivre encore et encore l’épuration de Stratholme ?
VoiceOver/Arthas/Pissed08=C’est dur d’être prince… Même si j’ai ma petite idée pour améliorer ma situation.

VoiceOver/Arthas/Pissed10=<rire du roi-liche> <raclement de gorge> Veuillez m’excuser, j’ai dû attraper froid.
VoiceOver/Arthas/Pissed11=J’avais autrefois un cheval qui s’appelait Invincible. <pause> Il portait bien mal son nom.
VoiceOver/Arthas/Pissed12=<SFX: Stomach growling noise> Génial, Deuillegivre a encore faim. Quelqu’un aurait un en-cas à frotter sur sa lame pour la calmer ? Un petit orphelin, par exemple ?
VoiceOver/Arthas/Pissed13=Fossoyeuse. Qu’est-ce que c’est que ce nom ?
VoiceOver/Arthas/Pissed14=Pourquoi personne ne veut jamais prendre le même bateau que moi ? Ce n’est pas comme si j’allais y mettre le feu...

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Uhoh00=On ne se relâche pas.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Uhoh01=Allez, on se bouge.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Uhoh02=J’l’ai pas touchééé…
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack00=L’échauffement est fini.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack01=Va y avoir du sport !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack02=On joue les prolongations !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack03=Tu vas passer un sale quart-temps…
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack04=Voyons ce que tu sais faire.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack05=Je suis incontrôlable.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack06=Essaie de bloquer ça !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack07=Ça, ça mérite un ralenti.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Celebrate00=Belle victoire pour nous.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Celebrate01=Un bel effort, mais ne vous relâchez pas.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill02=Un grand jour pour les tocards…<rire maléfique>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill03=Ska-doush.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill04=Alley-oop… adieu.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill05=Depuis une distance incroyable !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill06=Il tente un tir à trois points !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Healed00=Hmm. C’est plus efficace que de la glace.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Healed01=Très bon travail d’équipe.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Healed02=Y a pas meilleur soigneur dans toute la ligue.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroAgree00=On va tellement leur mettre la honte qu’ils vont retourner chez les poussins.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroAgree01=Trois, deux, un… Courez !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroAgree02=Je m’occupe de l’engagement.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroBoast00=On va leur dunker dessus, à ces abrutis !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroBoast01=On va leur montrer qui domine le terrain !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion00=Le match va bientôt commencer. Tu es prêt ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion01=Tiens-toi prêt. Le match va bientôt commencer.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Angel00=Quoi ? Je suis dans la même équipe qu’un ange ? T’as été choisi en dernier, c’est ça ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Chen00=Je vois que tu as apporté des rafraîchissements…
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=J’ai entendu dire que tu te débrouillais pas trop mal, Nephalem. Considère ce match comme un test.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Murky00=T’as intérêt à avoir une sacrée détente, le têtard.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Toi ? Mais qui m’a fichu un cinq de base pareil ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Intéressant. Tu m’as l’air d’avoir un bon niveau.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Prime00=Un primordial sur le terrain ? OK, suis-moi.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroRespond00=Quelle question… Je suis né avec un ballon de basket entre les griffes.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroRespond01=Imbécile. Je domine le terrain, tâche de ne pas l’oublier.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroRespond02=C’est moi qui ai tout appris à Tony.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Angel00=Écoute, l’ange : si tu attrapes le ballon, tu me le passes, compris ? Et estime-toi heureux que je t’aide.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Angry00=Imbécile. Je domine le terrain, tâche de ne pas l’oublier.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Annoyed00=Vous préférez me laisser sur le banc ? Mauvais choix tactique.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Chen00=Je suis Asmodunk, seigneur du panier.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Tu vas te prendre Asmodan dans les dents !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Qui a laissé ses déchets sur MON terrain ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hmm. OK, tu as du bagout, mais est-ce que tu sais dribbler ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Negative00=Si ça ne tenait qu’à moi, tu serais encore à lustrer le banc de touche.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Positive00=Que le match commence !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Prime00=On va leur montrer qu’on a une équipe d’enfer.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill00=Ce terrain est à moi.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill01=Dunkorama !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill02=Rien ne peut m’arrêter.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill03=Boum. Je suis chaud comme un barbecue.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill04=Il dribble, il tire et il marque.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillButcher00=Retourne jouer dans les ligues inférieures.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillD3Hero00=Pff, ces Nephalem ne savent pas sauter.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillDiablo00=Seigneur de la Terrible erreur, tu veux dire.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillSpreeEnd00=Temps mort.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillTyrael00=Essaie plutôt le baseball, ange.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillUther00=Le golf serait plus à ton rythme, vieillard.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowMana00=Du mana, ça ferait pas de mal.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowMana01=J’ai besoin de mana.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowMana02=Plus de mana.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/No00=Hum, non.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/No01=Ce n’est pas une bonne idée.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/No02=Ce serait stupide.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AssistHero00=Notre allié a des ennuis. Allez lui donner un coup de main.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AssistMe00=J’ai besoin d’un coup de main.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AssistMe01=On doit jouer en équipe. Venez par ici.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackCastle00=Tous sur l’idole !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackMerc00=Allez recruter ces mercenaires.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackOutpost00=L’action se concentre sur ce fort.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackTower00=On devrait prendre cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendCastle00=Défendez l’idole !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Ils visent notre fort. Interceptez-les.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendTower00=Ne les laissez pas prendre cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_KillHero00=Il faut qu’on se débarrasse de ce MVP.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed00=C’est pour quoi ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed01=Allez, fais-moi la passe.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed02=Arrête de me marquer d’aussi près.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed03=Tais-toi et dribble.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed04=Dans le Chaudron infernal, il n’y a qu’une seul règle : soit t’es une gâchette, soit t’es une mauviette.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed05=Le Chaudron infernal et l’Arène céleste s’affrontent depuis des millénaires dans les éternels playoffs. Quand la saison sera finie, il faudra faire sauter cette règle des deux points d’écart.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed06=Fais gaffe, Diablo. Cette année, le panier d’or est pour moi ! <rire satanique>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed07=Bienvenue dans le Chaudron infernal, mortels. Je suis votre meneur, votre entraîneur et votre arbitre.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed08=Qui c’est qui pète le feu maintenant, Impérius ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed09=Pour mes fans, c’est Asmodunk. Pour toi, ce sera « ô, grand dieu du basket éternel ».
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed10=D’abord, j’explose le panneau. Ensuite, je détruis votre monde.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed11=Vous savez pourquoi on se bat pour le contrôle de Sanctuaire ? Parce que c’est là que se jouent les finales ! Jouer à domicile, c’est un avantage indéniable.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed12=Les Nephalem qui veulent faire des dunks à tout-va, ça m’agace. Quand j’ai commencé, on apprenait d’abord les bases !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed13=Malthaël était un gros atout pour l’Arène céleste. Ça a été un coup de chance pour le Chaudron quand il a rompu son contrat.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed14=Je vais vous confier un petit secret : ce ne sont pas les baskets qui font le joueur. D’ailleurs, hum… je n’en porte pas.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed15=Pendant un moment, on faisait des paquets de céréales à mon effigie, mais il paraît que ça coupait l’appétit aux gamins. Allez comprendre.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB00=Bloquez-les.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB01=Ne compte pas sur moi pour te faire la passe.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB02=Souviens-toi de ce match.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Resurrected00=Et me revoilà.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Resurrected01=Ce n’est qu’une égratignure. J’y retourne.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Revive00=De retour sur le terrain.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Revive01=Renvoyez-moi sur le terrain, coach.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Revive02=Il faut savoir rebondir après un échec.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting00=Depuis une distance incroyable !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting01=Il tente un tir à trois points !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting02=Quel tir !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting03=Bloque un peu ça !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting04=C’est dans la poche.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec00=Classe.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec01=OK, coach.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec02=Ça sera impressionnant sur les ralentis.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec03=Personne ne me verra venir.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec04=Ah, super.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt00=Comment tu pourrais m’arrêter, si tu peux même pas me voir ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt01=Je joue à domicile, là.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt02=Qui a laissé ses déchets sur MON terrain ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/TeamKilled00=La prochaine fois, on se bouge un peu plus que ça, d’accord ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_ExLocked00=Va y avoir du sport.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_ExPurchased00=Prêt pour un nouveau match ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Gift00=Quoi ? Vous m’envoyez jouer ailleurs ? Pff, je n’ai jamais aimé cette équipe, de toute façon.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Lockin00=C’est parti !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Purchase00=Excellent choix de joueur.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Trial00=Ma technique va vous enflammer.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Trial01=Un match amical ? Quand est-ce qu’on passe aux choses sérieuses ?

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitLocked01=J’ai hâte de retrouver le terrain.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitPurchased00=Vous préférez me laisser sur le banc ? Mauvais choix tactique.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitPurchased01=Pendant que j’attendais, j’ai inventé une nouvelle stratégie. Ça s’appelle « Arrêtez de me faire perdre mon temps et jouez ».
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used00=Tout se joue maintenant !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used01=Tirez depuis la raquette !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used02=Surveillez le chronomètre.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate2Used00=Foncez dans le tas !
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate2Used01=J’ai besoin de mon équipe !

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroRespond02=Est-ce une offre ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=Ce que tu fais, c’est tout sauf te battre.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Annoyed00=Tu flirtes avec la mort !

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill01=Pauvre moins que rien.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillButcher00=Boucherie… du Boucher.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillD3Hero00=Je savais que je t’aurais un jour, Nephalem.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowLifeHeal02=Tu m’as bien servi, esclave.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowMana00=Je manque de mana.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowMana01=Je n’ai plus beaucoup de mana.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowMana02=Pas assez de mana.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed03=Ah, je ne me suis pas senti aussi confiant depuis le bastion de la Redoute !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed04=Si tu me trouves impressionnant sous cette forme, attends de voir ma tête flottante se moquer de toi  ! <evil laugh>
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed05=Diriger les lieutenants du péché n’est pas chose facile. Paresse est toujours en retard, Colère toujours en rogne, Orgueil pense qu’Avarice vole, Envie jalouse Avarice de s’en tirer, et Gourmandise essaie de manger tout le monde. Quant à Luxure, eh bien… elle... empêche de se concentrer.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed06=<snoring>Nelaphem et nouifs… Ici ! Et là ! Tout près ! <wakes up an growls> Ces satanés Nephalem me poursuivent jusque dans mon sommeil !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed07=Serviteurs, n’oubliez pas qu’il n’y a rien de plus toxique, de plus dangereux qu’un enfant nephalem. Un simple contact et vous êtes morts.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed09=J’ai une pêche d’enfer, alors continuons d’avancer.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed10=Vous vous entendez mal avec votre famille ? J’ai grandi avec les seigneurs des Enfers. Nos rivalités fraternelles ont dévasté des royaumes entiers.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed11=Ceux qui croient que les péchés mortels ne sont qu’au nombre de sept manquent cruellement d’imagination.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed12=Ça commence à me faire plus mal que mes piercings.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed13=Est-ce qu’on peut faire une pause une minute ? Il faut que j’écrive une série de récits sur cette bataille, puis que j’en éparpille les fragments un peu partout !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed14=Quoi ? Comment oses-tu m’appeler démon inférieur ? C’est MONSIEUR démon inférieur !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed15=<growl> Je suis vraiment damné.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB00=En avant.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Resurrected01=Ma victoire est assurée.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive00=Un seigneur des Enfers ne meurt jamais !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive01=Rien ne m’arrêtera !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive02=Un retard mineur.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec00=Délicieux.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec01=Je vais me délecter…
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec02=Je vais triompher.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec03=Intéressant…
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec04=La puissance coule dans mes veines !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt00=Ton destin est scellé !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt01=Une telle insolence est intolérable !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt02=Pardonne-moi, mon ami, car je vais pécher.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/TeamKilled00=Une victoire vide de sens. Nous finirons par triompher !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExLocked00=Je suis le véritable seigneur des Enfers !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Où se cachent nos ennemis ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Gift00=Ils m’appartiendront.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Lockin00=Qu’il en soit ainsi !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Purchase00=Un choix judicieux.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Les armées des Enfers s’impatientent.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Avez-vous envisagé tous les plaisirs du pêché ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Oui… Contemplez ma grandeur.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=J’ai soif de combats et de sang frais…
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used00=Vous pensez savoir ce qu’est l’angoisse ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used01=Noyé dans le péché !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used02=Avez-vous peur de la mort ?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used00=<laughs> Tu te croyais si habile.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used01=Ravageons ce monde !
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used02=Qu’ils soient tous déchiquetés !

Et si tu ne veux pas m’entendre, que les démons t’emportent !
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed04=Voyons voir... Écraser mes ennemis... ça, c’est fait. Les voir mourir devant moi... aussi. Entendre les lamentations de leurs femmes... Bon, ça, c’est pas forcément utile.

VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed12=Vous savez, ça fait un bout de temps qu’on me promet des combats contre de vrais joueurs.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed13=Attendez un peu, laissez-moi noter ça quelque part... Clic droit pour se déplacer, clic droit pour attaquer... Et à quoi sert le clic gauche déjà ? Pfiou, je déteste apprendre de nouvelles commandes.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed14=Mon peuple a coutume de dire :  « Quand il neige, enfile ton pagne le plus chaud ».
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed15=Mes épées sont plus grosses que les tiennes... Allez, ne t’en fait pas ! Ça arrive à vraiment beaucoup d’hommes...

VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Trial01=Je suis impatiente de tester ma nouvelle technique.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitLocked00=J’en ai assez d’attendre. Allons tremper nos lames dans le sang de l’ennemi.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitLocked01=Allons-y, nos ennemis sont impatients de se faire couper en deux.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitPurchased00=Finissons-en. Ma fureur s’amenuise.

VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Split00=Tempête : « Hi-ah ! »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Split01=Tempête : « Pour la Pandarie ! »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Split02=Feu : « Mange-toi ça ! »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Split03=Feu : « Un adversaire ! »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Split04=Terre : « C’est ma tournée ! »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Split05=Terre : « Vous allez goûtez au pandamonium ! »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Celebrate00=Bien joué, mes amis !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Celebrate01=Ça vaut bien une mousse ou deux !

VoiceOver/ChenBase/Healed02=Sacré remontant !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Healed_Split00=Tempête : « Merci beaucoup, l’ami. »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Healed_Split01=Feu : « Ça fait du bien. »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Healed_Split02=Terre : « Sacré remontant. »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroAgree00=Un jour, ça fera une belle histoire.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroAgree01=Ne vous précipitez pas. Concentrez-vous, de corps et d’esprit, mon ami.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroAgree02=Obtenir la victoire ne sera pas facile, mais peu de choses le sont.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroBoast00=On va bien s’amuser.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroBoast01=On se souviendra longtemps de ce combat !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion00=Alors, ça vous tente, un peu d'action ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion01=Vous êtes prêts pour un peu de pandamonium ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Eh bien, tu es vraiment un allié très étrange ! On m’appelle Chen…
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_LiLi00=Li Li, ne t’éloigne pas trop…
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Oh, un murloc ? Comment es-tu arrivé jusqu’ici ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Je vois… C’est bien toi.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Oh bonjour, l’ami ! Quel plaisir de te revoir !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Rexxar00=Rexxar ! Ça faisait longtemps !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Samuro00=Maître-lame ! Quelle joie de combattre de nouveau à vos côtés.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroRespond00=Ah ah, bien sûr !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroRespond01=J’ai appris de nouveaux mouvements…
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroRespond02=Ah, mais le combat commence de toute façon.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Tu veux une petite gorgée ? Ça te fera pousser le poil sur le torse !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_LiLi00=Ahh ! Maintenant oui.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hum… Eh bien… Je… Je n’ai rien.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Mmm… Nous devrons mettre de côté nos différends, pour le moment.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_OfCourse00=Ah ah, bien sûr !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Allons… Battons-nous pour notre peuple, notre famille et notre honneur.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Rexxar00=Lok’tar ogar, mon ami !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Samuro00=S’il faut se battre, alors je suis prêt.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill00=Vous ne tenez pas la boisson, hein ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill01=Remettons ça, à l’occasion !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill02=Oh oh oh ! Elle est bonne la poussière ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill03=Quel beau combat !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill04=Oh, il faut croire que c’est vous l’espèce menacée !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillDwarf00=Aïe… Certains nains ne tiennent pas la boisson.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillLiLi00=Bel effort, Li Li ! Relève-toi et nous recommencerons.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillRexxar00=Tu n’es plus si jeune, pas vrai, Rexxar ? <laughs>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSamuro00=Mieux vaut être maître brasseur que maître-lame.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSkeletonKing00=Ouh là là, tu devrais vraiment arrêter ce régime, on voit tes os !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Toute bonne chose a une fin.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Laugh00=<laugh>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal00=Hé bonjour. Merci… Ça commençait à chauffer par ici.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ahh, je me sens bien mieux.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal02=<chuckle> Je suis bien content de vous avoir à mes côtés.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana00=J'aurais bien besoin d'une petite boisson.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana01=Je crois que il est temps de boire un coup.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana02=Qui veut boire un coup ? Oh, moi, c’est vrai !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No00=Je ne crois pas, non.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No01=Pas cette fois, mon ami.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No02=Et je suis censé faire ça comment ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Vite, notre allié a besoin d'aide.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Hum, un peu d'aide ne serait pas de trop !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Venez m’aider, mes amis !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Attaquons l'idole ennemie !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Capturons ce camp de mercenaires.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Détruisez ce fort !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Nous devrions sécuriser cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Défendez l’idole !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Nous devrions défendre ce fort.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Défendre cette tour de guet serait une bonne idée.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_KillHero00=Quelqu'un peut se charger de ce héros ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed00=Hé, bonjour !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed01=Il va y avoir du grabuge ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed02=Se concentrer sur le positif. Écarter le négatif.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed03=Oh oui… Je connais de nombreuses histoires. Voulez-vous en entendre une ? <beat> Neuf quatre-vingt quinze la minute.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed04=Un vieil homme étonnant m’a dit un jour : « Reste sobre, mon ami. » <pleh> Quel horrible conseil ! <SFX: Sips his drink> Ahh !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed05=Le fait-maison, il y a que ça de vrai, parce qu’on peut le boire de suite !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed06=Vous savez, si vous passez par la brasserie Brune d’Orage, n’hésitez pas à vous arrêter. On a toujours besoin d’un coup de mains pour les corvées.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed07=Un homme sage m’a dit un jour : «  Une coupe vide n’est qu’une coupe qui attend d’être remplie. » <SFX: tapping on the side of a cup><clears throat> Hum, hum.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed08=L’important, c’est de toujours garder la maîtrise de soi, et ne pas laisser la boisson vous contrôler.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed09=Oh, et il faut boire beaucoup d’eau. C’est important aussi.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed10=Ceux qui errent ne sont pas toujours perdus… Bon d’accord, je suis perdu… mais pas TOUS les autres.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed11=Pour certains, qu’importe la destination, l’important c’est le voyage.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed12=La voie de l’explorateur est l’observation… s’abreuver d’une autre culture. Puis utiliser cette connaissance pour vivre une vie bien remplie. La voie du rôdeur en revanche… Eh bien… Disons simplement que ça finit mal.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed13=Pourquoi nous nous battons ? C’est comme demander pourquoi vous jouez à Heroes of the Storm. Pour l’expérience. Vous avez d’autres questions ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed14=Chen Brune d’Orage, maître brasseur. Demandez-moi en personne et refusez les imitations bas de gamme !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split00=Oui ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split01=Nous entendons l’appel.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split02=Terre : « Une minute… si moi je représente la terre, et lui le feu, et lui… Il nous manque pas un élément ? » Feu : « Tais-toi, tu me fatigues... »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split03=Feu : « Pour nous, chaque coup est un triplé gagnant. »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split04=Tempête : « Continue comme ça, et tu vas avoir de gros soucis, mon enfant. »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split05=Tempête : « Comme on dit… » Feu : « … jamais deux… » Terre : « … sans moi ! » Tempête : <sigh> « Bon allez, tu sors… Je ne veux plus te voir. »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Resurrected00=J'ai une dette envers vous, mon ami.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Resurrected01=<excited exertion> J’ai une dette envers vous.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive00=OK… je suis prêt ! Je suis prêt !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive01=Ouille aïe aïe ! Ça fait encore mal !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive02=Une bonne boisson fraîche.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec00=Hé, ça me plaît !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec01=Pas mal, pas mal.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec02=L’expérience nous rend plus forts.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec03=<laugh> Oh, elle est bien bonne, celle-là !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec04=Un antique secret pandaren, hein ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt00=Montrez-moi ce que vous savez faire !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt01=Toi là ! Montre-moi ce que tu sais faire !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt02=Ne vendez pas la peau du panda avant de l’avoir tué ! <laugh>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Split00=Tempête : « Que le combat commence ! »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Split01=Feu : « Toi là ! Montre-nous ce que dont tu es capable ! »
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Split02=Terre : « Ne vendez pas la peau du panda avant de l’avoir tué ! » <laughs>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/TeamKilled00=Ne vous découragez pas. On les aura bientôt.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_ExLocked00=Eh bien, bonjour, vous !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah, je suis content de vous revoir.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Gift00=Oh, je vais leur faire un bon gros câlin de votre part.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Lockin00=Pandamonium !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Purchase00=Une excellente décision !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Trial00=Oh, vous voulez apprendre le Chen Fu, hein ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Trial01=Il faut toujours goûter avant d’acheter.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Prenez tout votre temps. Car si on ne prend jamais son temps, comment peut-on en avoir ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Vous me dites quelque chose. On ne se serait pas déjà rencontrés en Pandarie ?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Vous êtes prêt pour un autre round ? Non ? Ça tombe bien, j'ai une petite soif.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Oh non, ma boisson s’est réchauffée… J’ai horreur de ça.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used00=Tempête, Terre, Feu, entendez mon appel !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used01=Les éléments entendent mon appel.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate2Used00=C'est l'heure de vous faire écraser !
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate2Used01=<sniff> Je devrais nettoyer ce tonneau plus souvent.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate2Used02=Il fait sombre ici…
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate2Used03=Ça roule !

VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroKill04=Nice job, team.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroKill05=Whooo.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroKill06=Killing a hero grants a lot of xp and puts stress on our enemy.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroKill07=That should take the enemy down a peg or two.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroKill08=A brutal assault.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroKill09=Ooo... that guy didn't read the patch notes.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSelect00=See, I told you I'd see you in the Nexus. This thing is about to start. Talent up.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSelect01=What's up, I'm Kevin from the Heroes dev team, and I'm here to announce your game. Let's get started.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSelect02=Welcome to Heroes of the Storm. Get ready for battle and don't forget your talent.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSelect_Observer00=We did it, internet. Here's me seeing you in the Nexus. This battle is about to begin, so let's watch.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSlain00=Rough one. Don't get discouraged. 
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSlain01=Think of it...as a break.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSlain02=Not good...Focus up.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSlain03=It's ok. You got this. 
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSlain04=One step back...two steps forward.
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSlain05=Don't sweat it, stay sharp. 
VoiceOver/CloakenA/HeroSlain06=<Sigh> We're dead...

VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroKill03=Une issue méritée.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroKill04=Que cela ne vous monte pas à la tête.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroKill05=Bien joué. Maintenant, au suivant.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroKill06=Cette passe d’armes ne m’a pas déplu.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSelect00=La croisade nous appelle, héros. Apprêtez-vous.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSelectPlayer00=Une autre croisée ! Cela fait longtemps que je n’ai pas voyagé en compagnie d’une sœur du Zakarum.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSelectPlayer01=Vous semblez étonnamment familière… On ne se serait pas déjà croisées quelque part ? Dans une taverne, par exemple ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSelectPlayer02=Je vois que la coiffure que j’ai lancée fait toujours fureur chez les croisées.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSelect_Observer00=On veut se la couler douce, c’est ça ? Très bien. Profitons du le spectacle !
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSlain00=Vous avez mordu la poussière.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSlain01=La Lumière n’abandonne pas ses soldats si facilement.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSlain02=La croisade prévaudra.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSlain03=Un combat de premier ordre. Maintenant, reprenez-vous et retournez-y.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSlain04=Ne désespérez pas. La gloire vous tend les bras.

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_Caution00=L’ennemi est proche.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_GoodJob00=Bien joué.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_GoodJob01=Je suis impressionnée.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_GoodJob02=Une juste frappe.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_Heal00=L’ami, tu as besoin de soins !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_Heal01=Pense à faire un tour à la fontaine.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_Retreat00=Je dois me replier, mon ami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_Retreat01=Je reviendrai, comptez sur moi.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_Uhoh00=C’est regrettable.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_Uhoh01=Nous devons poursuivre le combat.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_Uhoh02=Pleurer les morts ne nous aidera pas !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack00=Tremblez devant le Zakarum !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack01=Par la Lumière !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack02=Comme des insectes que l’on balaye !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack03=Que la lumière vous condamne !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack04=Rien n’arrête la croisade !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack05=Que la lumière brûle ta chair !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack06=Fais tes prières. Et vite.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Celebrate00=Nous avons réussi !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Celebrate01=Une victoire éclatante, mais notre ouvrage n’est pas terminé !

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Death10=<Death Exertions>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Death11=<Death Exertions>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Healed00=Je vais beaucoup mieux.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Healed01=Mes plaies guérissent.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Healed02=Merci, mon ami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroAgree00=Akarat est avec nous.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroAgree01=Dans ce cas, allons-y.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroAgree02=Assurément.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroBoast00=J’ai presque pitié de nos ennemis.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroBoast01=Nous devrions en avoir fini rapidement.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion00=Vous êtes prêts pour la bataille qui s’annonce ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion01=Sois prêt, mon ami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Je t’interdis de révéler nos plans à l’ennemi. Je suis sérieuse. Pas un mot.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Évite de rester coincé dans une porte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Un autre Nephalem ! J’imagine que les serviteurs des Enfers sont devenus plus puissants.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Même des démons ont été entraînés dans ce conflit, à ce que je vois.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_DiabloHero00=Ta dernière bataille remonte à bien longtemps. Es-tu opérationnel ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Ton engeance ne devrait pas avoir droit de cité dans ce monde.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Encore une alliance éphémère, à ce que je vois.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil02=Ta présence n’est que tolérée, mécréant.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good00=C’est toujours un plaisir de me battre aux côtés d’alliés dignes de ce nom.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good01=Ah, tu es là. Cela va nous faciliter la tâche.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good02=Allons faire œuvre de bien, d’accord ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Imperius00=Vous supporterez le fait de vous battre aux côtés d’une mortelle, Impérius ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Léoric, qu’est-ce que ça fait d’être du côté des gentils, pour une fois ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Lord00=Un seigneur des Enfers se bat à mes côtés ? La Fin des temps doit être proche.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=Il me semblait t’avoir déjà tué à plusieurs reprises, Malthaël.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Mephisto00=Le seigneur de la Haine. Très impressionnant, à n’en pas douter.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=As-tu réfléchi à mon offre, Bourbie ? Je dois absolument me trouver un bon apprenti.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Tu crois vraiment être digne de te battre à mes côtés ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Nous ensemble, crois-tu que nos ennemis ont la moindre chance de gagner ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Tyraël, c’est un honneur de combattre à vos côtés.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Tu penses pouvoir suivre le rythme, paladin ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond00=Je suis toujours prête.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond01=C’est la croisade qui m’a menée ici.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond02=Toujours.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Il est malavisé de provoquer une croisée.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=C’est tout ? Je m’attendais à une énième litanie du genre : « Tu ne me vaincras jamais, etc. »
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Ouuuh, j’ai peur. Peut-être que tu devrais essayer ça sur nos ennemis.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=Excuse-moi… Tu disais ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Nous leur donnerons quand même du fil à retordre.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Et si vous me racontiez tout ça après le combat, Deckard ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=L’opinion d’un démon n’a jamais eu de valeur à mes yeux.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_DiabloHero00=Terrassons notre ennemi, puis nous trouverons un moyen de rentrer chez nous.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=<sigh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil00=Je préférerais de loin me battre contre toi qu’à tes côtés.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil01=Le monde se porterait bien mieux sans toi.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil02=Il est trop tard pour changer d’alliés ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=Voilà des paroles auxquelles j’adhère.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good00=Telle est la volonté d’Akarat.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good01=Je serai votre bouclier.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good02=Nous triompherons main dans la main !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Imperius00=Ah, vous êtes là, Impérius. On rentre vraiment ici comme dans un moulin.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Disons que j’ai connu pire, comme allié. Vous avez entendu parler d’un certain Lyndon ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Lord00=Je te retourne la remarque, démon.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=Nous sommes dans le même camp, Malthaël, donc je t’épargnerai… peut-être.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto00=Ha ha ha. Tout flatteur vit aux dépens de celui qui l’écoute.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Des paroles empreintes de sagesse, comme d’habitude, mon éloquent ami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Les circonstances font de nous des alliés. Concentrons-nous sur notre ennemi actuel.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_No00=Hors de question que je te gratifie d’une réponse.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Nous voilà réunis ! Nous allons être invincibles.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Et la vôtre, Tyraël.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=En tout cas, moi, je suis prête. Tu sais, personne ne te reprochera de ne pas pouvoir suivre, paladin. Tu joues dans la cour des grands, c’est tout.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Hm, ce n’est pas comme ça que ça marche.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill00=Qu’Akarat ait pitié de toi, car je n’en aurai aucune !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill01=La croisade t’a rattrapé.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill02=Au moins, tu auras essayé.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill03=À la prochaine.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill04=Pas de chance pour toi, l’ami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillAngel00=Retourne dans les Cieux !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillButcher00=Les esprits des morts ont été vengés.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDeckard00=Désolé, mon vieil ami, mais tu étais vraiment trop bavard.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDemon00=Tu ne peux te cacher de moi dans ce monde, démon !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiablo00=On en est à la quantième, Diablo ? Je perds toujours le compte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiabloHero00=Ton temps est révolu, héros.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillImperius00=Voilà ce qui arrive aux bavards.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillLeoric00=Retourne dans ton donjon, Léoric.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillMephisto00=Et dire que tu te disais le plus malin de la bande…
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillNephalem00=Mes regrets, Nephalem.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillSpreeEnd00=En voilà assez !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillTyrael00=Sans rancune, mais c’est l’âge des Nephalem, mon ami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillUther00=Les paladins. Laissez-moi rire !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillWhitemane00=Voilà une fanatique de moins.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh00=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh01=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh02=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh03=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh04=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal00=Il s'en est fallu de peu !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal01=Des soins magistraux, l’apothicaire.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal02=N’en arrivons plus à de telles extrémités.                                             ALT : Tâchons de mieux nous en sortir la prochaine fois.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana00=Pas assez de mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana01=Je n’ai plus beaucoup de mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana02=Il me faut plus de mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No00=Non.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No01=Je regrette.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No02=Pas maintenant.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Notre allié a besoin d’aide !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe00=J’ai besoin de votre aide !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Votre aide me serait précieuse !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Tous sur l’idole ennemie ! Taïaut !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Amadouons ces mercenaires.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Prenons ce fort d’assaut !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Le cavalier prend la tour !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Regroupons-nous devant l’idole !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Faites une ligne de défense à ce fort.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Défendez cette tour.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_KillHero00=Ce héros doit être neutralisé… et vite.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed00=Bonjour.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed01=Oui ? Que me voulez-vous ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed02=Pourquoi cliquez-vous sur moi plutôt que sur des ennemis ou du butin ? Dans quel genre de jeu suis-je ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed03=Des blagues ? Vous voulez des blagues ? Très bien, si c’est pour avoir la paix…
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed04=Que dit un croisé à son apprenti quand il n’est pas à la hauteur ? T’as qu’à ratrer chez toi ! <laugh> … non ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed05=… Bon, l’humour croisé n’est pas du goût de tout le monde.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed06=Un jour, je purifierai le Zakarum et notre croisade s'achèvera. Mais alors, que ferai-je ? Bah, je suis certaine qu'il y aura toujours des impies à châtier !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed07=Ce « Nexus » m’a tout l'air bizarre. Peut-être la façon dont la lumière y est réfléchie…
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed08=Une compétence essentielle du croisé, c’est la résistance à l’envie de se gratter, parce qu’avec une armure pareille, c’est même pas la peine d’y penser…
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed09=Ô Akarat, bénis ce saint fléau, fais-le s’abattre sur mes ennemis, qu’il les réduise en tout petits petits morceaux de rien du tout. Loué soit ton nom au plus haut des Cieux pour les siècles des siècles.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed10=Je porte le nom de mon maître, comme il portait le nom du sien. Un jour, mon apprenti portera le mien, et après cela, son apprenti portera le sien. En gros, on porte tous le même nom !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed11=Notre ordre est composé de joyeux boute-en-train et de fanfarons de tous horizons. Quand on se rassemble tous, on peut dire que la croisade s’amuse !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed12=Un pâle type me prenait pour une templière, l’autre jour. Je lui ai demandé s’il m’avait déjà entendue beugler « grandiose ! », ce à quoi il a répondu « maintenant, oui ». Il était très spirituel, ce gars. Dommage qu’il soit mort.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed13=Cliquez-moi dessus encore une fois, et je jure que je vous coupe le doigt. Ou tout autre appendice qui vous sert à actionner cette souris.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected00=Vous avez toute ma gratitude, l’ami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected01=Mes remerciements.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive00=Je me relève !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive01=Je retourne au combat.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive02=Je ferais bien de vite prendre une apprentie.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec00=Tu as choisi… judicieusement.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec01=Excellent.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec02=La Lumière me prête force !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec03=C’était attendu.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec04=Je suis du même avis.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt00=Si votre équipe a de vrais héros, envoyez-les-moi !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt01=Dans la croisade, tu ne tiendrais pas un jour.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt02=Mon apprentie te ferait mordre la poussière. Et je n’en ai même pas !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/TeamKilled00=J’ai connu pire. Ne désespérez pas.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExLocked00=Mes respects, l’ami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Revoilà une vieille connaissance.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Gift00=Vous êtes une âme charitable.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Lockin00=La croisade appelle.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Purchase00=Un choix empreint de sagesse.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial00=Très bien, voyons voir comment cela fonctionne.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial01=Vous souhaitez rejoindre la croisade ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Vous pondérez vos actes avant de les poser. C’est très sage.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Vous êtes quelqu’un de très réfléchi.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=La croisade nous appelle, mon ami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Il y a une certaine beauté dans l’immobilisme. Mettons-y une fin abrupte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate1Used00=Que frappe la colère des cieux.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used00=La foi est mon armure.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used01=Vous n’irez pas plus loin.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used02=Halte !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used03=Attrape ça !
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used04=Que cela cesse.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/VOX_Attack00=<Attack exertion - around 1 second. Swinging a flail.>

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes02=C’est bien par ici ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes03=C’est la volonté d’Akarat.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes04=Bien sûr.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes05=Cela me semble juste.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes06=Pourquoi pas ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes07=La croisade appelle.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes08=J’y vais.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack00=En avant ! À l’attaque !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack01=Profitons de leur faiblesse pour attaquer !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack02=Attaquez ! Vous vous reposerez quand ils seront morts !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Caution00=Attention !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Caution01=Gardez les yeux ouverts !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob00=Lok-tar !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob01=Une frappe excellente.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob02=Ha ha ha !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Heal00=Ta blessure est profonde. Je trouverais vite une fontaine de soins si j’étais toi.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Heal01=Tu es au seuil de la mort. Arrange ça.

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion00=On se sent prêt, blanc-bec ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion01=J’entends battre les tambours de guerre ! Préparez-vous, guerriers.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=L’Alliance. Peuh !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_AurielSpirit00=Je me bats aux côtés d’un gardien des âmes. Personne ne me croira au village, c’est sûr.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Tu es d’apparence humaine, mais… Hmmm, je vais garder un œil sur toi.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Un démon ? Dommage, j’aurais espéré un allié capable de gagner de temps en temps.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Les Chanteguerre ne prennent pas le parti du mal de leur plein gré.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Hors de ma vue, être inférieur.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil02=Toi ? Rhah. Mes aïeux, ayez pitié de moi…
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Garrosh. Tous les Chanteguerre ne sont pas prêts à te suivre dans ta folie.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Gazlowe00=Gazleu ? Hah, ça devrait être amusant, à défaut d’autre chose.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good00=Tu n’aurais pas un petit côté imbécile heureux ? Voire un gros ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good01=Ravie de voir qu’il y a au moins une guerrière honorable ici.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good02=Ah, c’est toi. Je peux m’en arranger.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Lok’tar !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_JunkratGoblin00=Reste derrière moi et explose tout ce qui se met en travers de notre route !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Encore un laquais de Sylvanas, je suppose.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Une minute, vous êtes trois ? Vous pensez pouvoir suivre mon rythme ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Un Murloc ! Je m’amusais à vous envoyer dans la rivière à coups de pied ! Oups, pardon.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Negative00=J’en ai plus qu’assez des alliés au rabais.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Ha, tu m’as l’air costaud.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Chef de guerre Thrall. C’est un honneur.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Je reconnais ton armure, paladin. Les Chanteguerre n’ont pas oublié les camps de prisonniers de Lordaeron.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Whitemane00=Tu es un de ces zélotes écarlates ? Aucune utilité.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Yrel00=Une Draeneï ? Si je m’attendais à ça…
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond00=Lok’tar ogar !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond01=Mon sang bouillonne déjà de fureur.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond02=Attendez que ces portes s’ouvrent.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Ne t’inquiète pas, chien de l’Alliance. La Horde va gagner cette bataille pour toi.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Angry00=Je vais broyer tes os jusqu’au dernier !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_AurielSpirit00=Un gardien des âmes ? Je ne suis pas morte, quand même ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Butcher00=<Growls back>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Confused00=C’était quoi, ce bruit ? Cette chose parle ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Je ne te connais pas, vermine humaine, et je n’en ai aucune envie.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Demon00=Les Orcs en ont assez de ton espèce, démon.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Je me passerais bien de ton opinion, blanc-bec.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil00=Silence, la bataille commence. Je m’occuperai de toi plus tard.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil01=Je me souviendrai de ça le moment venu de nous affronter.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil02=Je suis là pour combattre l’ennemi, mais je peux faire une exception pour toi…
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Excited00=Excellent !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Au moins, je te donne raison sur ce point.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Gazlowe00=Nan. Ça me gratte de partout et je suis fatiguée.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good00=C’est toujours un plaisir de se battre aux côtés de guerriers fiables.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good01=L’honneur sera notre bouclier.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good02=Force.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Horde00=Pour la Horde !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_JunkratGoblin00=Tu me cherches, petit porc ? Je vais te défoncer le crâne pour ces paroles, tu le sais, ça ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Quel inconscient est mort pour que tu deviennes roi ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=C’est quoi, un Tomator ? Ça se mange ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Murky00=Et on dit que l’orc est difficile à comprendre.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Negative00=Ferme ton clapet.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_No00=Tu as perdu la tête ? Bien sûr que non.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ça, tu l’as dit. Je ne rêve que d’une chose : un bon combat !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Ouais, c’est ça.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Lok-narash !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Uther00=Cesse de te plaindre, humain. Notre entente forcée ne m’enchante pas non plus.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Parle-moi encore sur ce ton, peau-rose. J’adore remettre les humains à leur place.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Yrel00=C’est touchant de noblesse. Ferme-la et bats-toi, Draeneï.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill00=Sang et tonnerre !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill01=Ah, ça flatte l’ego.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill02=J’ai combattu bien plus fort.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill03=C’était quoi, ça ? Peuh !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill04=Au suivant ! Qu’on m’en apporte d’autres !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill05=Broyé tels les os contre le métal.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillAlliance00=Vermine de l’Alliance.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillAngel00=Ces gardiens des âmes sont de plus en plus agressifs.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillChogall00=Voilà ce qu’on fait aux traîtres ! Et c’est valable pour tous les deux !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillCrusader00=Est-ce que cette humaine avait… mon visage ? Je dois avoir des hallucinations.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillDemon00=On dirait que la Légion ardente va devoir accélérer son recrutement.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillDwarf00=Alterac appartient aux Loups-de-Givre !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillGuldan00=Tu mérites un sort mille fois pire, démoniste.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillHorde00=Tu as succombé honorablement, guerrier de la Horde.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillLeoric00=Reviens vite, que je puisse encore te tuer !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillNephalem00=Étonnamment robuste… pour un humain.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillNightElf00=Ha ! Une tête d’elfe ! Najak va adorer ça.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillSpreeEnd00=Folie meurtrière terminée, blanc-bec !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillSylvanas00=Chef de guerre ? Pas la mienne, en tout cas…
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillUther00=Les paladins. Bah.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillWarchief00=J’aurais cru qu’un ancien chef de guerre serait plus coriace.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillWhitemane00=Espèce de pimbêche suffisante !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh01=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh02=<large laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh03=<aggressive laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal00=Hah. Oui !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal01=La force revient en moi !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal02=Pas le temps de te remercier, j’y retourne !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana00=Pas assez de mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana01=Il me faut plus de mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana02=C’est une blague ? J’ai plus du tout de jus !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd00=À moi la victoire !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd01=Servir est ma fierté.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd02=Ce fut un honneur.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No00=Hah, non.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No01=Impossible.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No02=Vous n’avez rien de mieux à faire ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistHero00=Notre allié est dans la mouise !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistMe00=À moi !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistMe01=J’ai besoin d’aide par ici !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackCastle00=Prenez-les à la gorge ! Frappez leur idole !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackMerc00=Réduisez ces mercenaires en esclavage !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Attaquons ce fort tous ensemble !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackTower00=Emparez-vous de cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendCastle00=Protégez notre idole !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Défendons ce fort !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendTower00=Ne laissez pas l’ennemi approcher de cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_KillHero00=Je veux que ce héros meure !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed00=Mok’ra.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed01=Qu’est-ce que je peux faire pour vous ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed02=Lâchez-moi, blanc-bec !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed03=Arrêtez de m’énerver !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed04=Hah, raté !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed05=Y en a marre ! Activez le JcJ si vous l’osez !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed06=J’ai déjà cru voir une version humaine de moi-même sur le champ de bataille. Toute blonde et bien comme il faut. Beurk, ça me dégoûte rien que d’y repenser.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed07=Trente minutes, vous trouvez ça long ? Une fois, j’ai combattu dans la vallée d’Alterac pendant deux jours sans interruption ! Ça aurait pu aller plus vite si tout le monde ne s’était pas planqué dans une grotte, mais là n’est pas la question !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed08=Un jour, j’ai perdu mon mari dans les Tarides. Il était presque réduit à l’état de cadavre quand je l’ai retrouvé.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed09=Certains humains voient les Orcs comme de nobles guerriers incompris. Ils essaient de nous faire surmonter nos problèmes à grand renfort de paroles. Leur expression de surprise quand je leur déchausse les dents vaut son pesant d’or.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed10=Vous avez déjà remarqué que les donneurs de quête orcs pouvaient parler le commun, mais pas les aventuriers orcs ? Comment expliquez-vous ça ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed11=Bon, j’aimerais qu’on m’explique rapidement ce qui se passe ici. Je suis une Orque paladin ? Ça existe, ça ? Je suis à peu près sûre que ça n’existe pas.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed12=Je suis une croisée, alors ? C’est quoi, une croisée ? D’accord, et c’est quoi, la différence avec un paladin ? Pfff, vous savez quoi ? Laissez tomber.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed13=Vérifiez toujours si votre loup redoutable a des puces avant de monter dessus. Et si vous vous dites que ça sent le vécu, vous avez raison.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed14=J’étais commandant chanteguerre, avant. J’adorais charger au cœur de la bataille ! Mais, euh… Il s’est passé des trucs… On est devenus moins populaires… Bref, j’ai dû trouver un nouveau boulot.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Resurrected00=Mes ancêtres m’ont ordonné d’y retourner.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Resurrected01=Merci, tout était devenu sombre.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive00=Ma vie pour la Horde !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive01=Qui a fait ça ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive02=Force et honneur !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive03=Pas de mal de la résurrection ? Ha !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec00=Ça fera l’affaire.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec01=Mais c’est que vous semblez savoir ce que vous faites, en plus !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec02=C’est malin. Mais je déteste les petits malins.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec03=Du moment que ça m’aide à écraser l’ennemi.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec04=Gloire à la Horde.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Taunt00=L’honneur est mon bouclier.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Taunt01=Tu doutes de mon honneur ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Taunt02=Tu oses me défier ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/TeamKilled00=Ils nous ont tous eus comme des blancs-becs…
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_ExLocked00=Salutations.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_ExPurchased00=Throm’ka, guerrier.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_Gift00=Enfin, une mission à remplir !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_Lockin00=Pour la Horde.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_Purchase00=Voilà un acte fort !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_Trial00=C’est le moment de me dégourdir les muscles !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_Trial01=C’est toujours mieux que les mannequins d’entraînement d’Orgrimmar.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_VOX_Spun00=<Dizzy exertions>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_VOX_Spun01=<Dizzy exertions>

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_VOX_Spun04=<Dizzy exertions>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_WaitLocked00=Allons sur le terrain d’entraînement. L’inaction me ronge.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_WaitLocked01=Vous tergiversez trop, vous le savez ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_WaitPurchased00=Vous voulez bien vous dépêcher de faire quelque chose ? J’ai pas envie de passer en mode absent.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_WaitPurchased01=C’est terriblement calme, ici… Je déteste ça.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate1Used00=Le couperet… va… tomber !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate2Used00=Vous n’irez pas plus loin !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate2Used01=Je vais te défigurer !
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate2Used02=Où tu vas comme ça ?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate2Used03=Mange-toi ça !

VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Attack02=Je piaffe d’impatience. Attaquons !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Caution00=Ils sont après nous. Soyez prudents.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_GoodJob00=C’était bien.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_GoodJob01=Incroyable !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_GoodJob02=Il faut que je raconte ça aux autres dryades.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Heal00=Tu te flétris. Va te rafraîchir à la fontaine !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Heal01=Ça ne va pas se soigner tout seul. Va t’hydrater.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Retreat00=Battons en retraite.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Retreat01=Je dois me retirer.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Uhoh00=Non !

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Attack06=Ils vont tomber comme des feuilles mortes.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Celebrate00=Hahaha !

VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion00=Vous êtes prêts pour un combat sauvage ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion01=Je vois que tu es paré pour le combat.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Chogall00=C’est quoi, ton programme ? Jouer double-jeu avec moi, c’est ça ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Dryad00=Salut, frangine.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Greymane00=Ça va, mon loup ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Hearthstone00=<Reuses Attack01>
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=Alors, toi aussi tu as échoué ici, archidruide ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Monk00=Qu’est-ce que tu regardes comme ça ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Ah, euh, je suis un peu rouillée, mais… <speaking in hesitant nerglish, like saying "hello"> Mrrglr ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Pourquoi apportes-tu la mort sur ces terres ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Comment suis-je censée aider quelqu’un comme toi ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Voilà exactement le genre d’allié dont j’ai besoin !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroRespond00=Pourquoi je serais ici sinon ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroRespond01=Bien sûr. Je suis là pour ça.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=À côté de cet endroit, le Rêve d’émeraude n’a rien d’anormal.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Greymane00=Tu ne vas quand même pas lever la patte pour marquer ton territoire, j’espère ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=Tu crois peut-être que les paroles d’un mortel sont d’une quelconque importance pour l’enfant d’un dieu ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=Tu peux pas dire bonjour comme tout le monde ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Monk00=J’espère qu’ils ne t’ont pas gratifié que de ça.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Mrglrlg. Mrgglr !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Tu es gentil, tu tiens tes squelettes, d’accord ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Et si tu allais voir ailleurs si j’y suis ?

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill00=Un peu d’engrais pour les plantes.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill01=Tu l’as bien mérité.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill02=Tu aurais dû y penser avant.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill03=Tu ne fais plus qu’un avec la forêt maintenant.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill04=C'était la seule solution…
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillDryad00=Pourquoi tant de haine entre nous, ma sœur ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillGazlowe00=Tu n’avais pas prévu cette panne, n’est-ce pas ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillGreymane00=Du loup, tu n’as que l’apparence.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillIllidan00=Tu n’as pas encore dévasté assez de mondes ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillMalfurion00=Tu as toujours été un archidruide en papier mâché, Malfurion.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Tu t’es attaqué à la mauvaise proie.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillTechCharacter00=Le métal, c’est dans la poubelle jaune.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ça va beaucoup mieux.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana00=Je n’ai presque plus de mana.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana01=Je n’ai plus beaucoup de mana.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana02=Génial… Mon mana est au plus bas.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/No00=Ça m’étonnerait !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/No01=Pas vraiment, non.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/No02=<scoff> Impossible.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Cet allié a besoin de nous.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AssistMe00=C’est le moment de travailler en équipe et de venir m’aider !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Un coup de main ne serait pas de refus.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Fracassez l’idole ennemie !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Capturons ce camp de mercenaires !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Détruisez ce fort de malheur !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Nous devons nous emparer de cette tour !

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Ne laissez pas tomber notre fort !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Cette tour de guet ne tiendra pas sans notre aide.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_KillHero00=Il faudrait faucher ce héros.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed00=Je suis la première des dryades.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed01=La forêt n’a pas besoin d’être protégée, mais toi oui.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed02=Nous allons reprendre ce que les mortels nous ont volé.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed03=Mon père Cénarius est puissant. Mais moi, je suis déterminée.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed04=Ne vous méprenez pas : les mortels sont très forts pour s’entretuer. Mais la nature a un véritable don pour ça.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed05=Mais qu’est-ce qu’elles ont ces plantes au juste ? On peut savoir ce qu’ils utilisent comme engrais ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed06=Non, les dryades ne broutent pas, et je trouve votre question déplacée.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed07=Pour être honnête, je ne mange que du bio et du local. Vous feriez pareil si les gobelins monopolisaient le secteur de la grande distribution dans votre région.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed08=On peut dire que je suis une force de la nature.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed09=Promenez-vous dans les bois, tant que la dryade n’y est pas. Si la dryade y était, elle vous empalerait !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed10=… et puis elle a dit, genre, « Là, tu me mets du baume au cœur ! » Et puis, je lui ai dit, genre, « Si tu la boucles pas tout de suite, je t’envoie direct à l’équarrissage ! »
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed11=Rien ne vaut la beauté des grands espaces. Les venins, les poisons, les épines, les petites lianes étrangleuses toutes mignonnes ! Je pourrais les contempler pendant des heures.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed12=Si jamais vous dites que je revends mon crottin aux fermiers de la région pour arrondir mes fins de mois, je vous tue !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed13=Écoutez, je n’ai pas choisi mon prénom, c’est mon père qui me l’a donné en hommage à ma grand-mère. Il devrait vraiment arrêter de vivre dans le passé, celui-là…
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed14=Appelez-moi Mylune et vous allez voir de quels bois je me chauffe !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed15=La plupart des dryades maîtrisent le cerf, le lapin et l’oiseau, mais moi, je parle aussi couramment le serpent, l’ours et sept dialectes scorpions rarissimes. <hissing> Kssss. Ksss. KSSSS !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed16=Je parie que vous n’avez jamais été à une fête organisée par des dryades ! On y boit plus de jus de baie lunaire que pendant toute la foire de Sombrelune.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed17=Une, deux, une, deux ! Et on lève les pattes ! Et on tient ! … et quatre, et cinq ! Et maintenant, on saute en hennissant ! Et on sourit !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed18=Vous avez dévasté votre monde, ne venez pas dévaster le mien !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected00=Joli.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected01=Merci l’ami. Ce n’est pas terminé.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive00=Je suis éternelle.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive01=La vie trouve toujours son chemin.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive02=Mon combat n’est pas terminé.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec00=Ça va être trop bien.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec01=Ah, ça va me servir.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec02=Parfait.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec03=La nature m’accorde ses bienfaits.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec04=Je me sens déjà plus forte.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt00=Qu’est-ce qui ne va pas ? Tu es allergique à quelque chose ? <laughs>
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt01=Tu as peut-être croisé de gentilles dryades bienveillantes. Je ne suis pas l’une d’elles.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt02=Tu ferais un engrais parfait.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/TeamKilled00=Vous aurez beau nous faucher, nous reviendrons !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExLocked00=Quelque chose vous intrigue, mortel ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Tous les amis de la forêt sont les bienvenus.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Gift00=Vous m’offrez ? Mais je suis quoi, moi ? Un pot de fleurs ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Lockin00=La chasse commence !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Purchase00=Que les bénédictions de la nature soient sur vous !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial00=Oui, très bien.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial01=Tant que ça ne dure pas trop longtemps.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Les prairies de Kalimdor me manquent...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Les étendues sauvages m’appellent.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=J’ai attendu trop longtemps.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Arrêtez de me regarder. Je ne vais rien faire de mignon.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used00=Vous ne pouvez pas échapper à la nature.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used01=Vous allez souffrir autant que les terres sauvages ont souffert !
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used02=Attaquons-nous à la racine du problème ! 
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate2Used00=Pourquoi ne pas ralentir un moment ?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate2Used01=Championne de saut en hauteur !

VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelect_Observer00=Ah, la tension monte au sein des deux équipes. On va avoir droit à une belle bagarre.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain00=Tu t’es fait tuer. Tu t’en remettras.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain01=Quoi ? Qu’est-ce que j’ai raté ? Je regardais ailleurs.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain02=Maintenant que t’es mort… Je peux avoir ton appareil à raclette ?
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain03=Holà, ça a dû faire mal.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain04=Ça va aller, cours vite jusqu’à ton cadavre et… Ah, il a disparu… Et ben va falloir attendre.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain05=Dis, tu te souviens de la fois où tu t’es fait tuer ? Laquelle ? Ah, c’est vrai qu’y en a eu tellement…

VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy01=Ah, je sais pas si l’assurance couvre ce genre de dégâts.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy02=Oh la belle bleue ! Ça vaut bien un huit sur dix.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy03=Et paf le fort. C’était, heu, mignon.

VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostLost02=Un de nos forts est parti en fumée…
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerAbandon00=Hé, je crois que quelqu’un vient de baisser les bras. Tsss, navrant.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerAbandon01=Bon, l’intelligence d’un héros vient de devenir artificielle. Je vous laisse juger de la différence.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerAbandon02=Va, je ne te hais point.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerRejoin00=Tiens, t’es revenu… Non, non, on ne parlait pas de toi.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerRejoin01=Hé ! Regardez qui est de retour ! C’est la faute à la connexion, c’est ça ? Ouais, je l’aurais parié…

VoiceOver/GazloweA/TeamKill01=Tous les ennemis sont morts. Joli.

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh_W02=Vous osez vous en prendre à ma meute ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack00=Pour Gilnéas !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack01=Je t’enterrerai de mes mains !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack02=Ta vie appartient au passé !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack03=Il est temps de frapper !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack04=La vengeance s’offre à moi !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack05=Pas de quartier !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack06=La victoire nous appartient !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W00=À ton tour !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W01=Cette erreur te sera fatale !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W02=Plus rien ne me retient !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W03=Les Gilnéens ne connaissent pas la retraite !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W04=Je vais t’écraser !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W05=J’ai flairé ta piste !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W06=Pas d’échappatoire !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Celebrate00=Hah ! Excellent travail.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Celebrate01=<Scoffs>Vous appelez ça des fortifications ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Comeback00=Nous gagnons du terrain !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Comeback_W00=Nous chassons en meute !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Death00=<Death exertion>

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Death_W06=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Death_W07=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed00=J’apprécie le geste.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed01=Ton aide arrive à point nommé, soigneur.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed02=Je sens revenir mes forces.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed_W00=Ah, je me sens mieux. Merci, soigneur.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed_W01=Prêt à leur sauter à la gorge !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed_W02=Merci, guérisseur.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree00=Voilà une alliance qui n’est pas pour me déplaire.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree01=Ta détermination m’impressionne.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree02=Cette meute fera bonne chasse.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroBoast00=Nos ennemis regretteront ce jour.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroBoast01=Par l’acier ou les crocs, nous triompherons.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion00=Vous avez intérêt à être prêts.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion01=Vous êtes-vous préparés au combat ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Tu as trahi ton peuple, Arthas. Il n’y a pas de plus grand crime.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Baelog00=Je me battrais jusqu’à la mort pour retrouver mon foyer. Et toi ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Erik00=Il n’y a rien de plus important à mes yeux que la renaissance de Gilnéas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Kael'thas00=Gilnéas ne porte pas Quel’thalas dans son cœur, mais j’imagine que nous sommes forcés de coopérer.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Je commence à en avoir assez des monarques morts-vivants.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Lunara00=N’aie crainte, dryade. Je suis plus proche de la nature que les autres humains.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=Je ne suis jamais enclin à accepter de l’aide, archidruide, mais merci de m’offrir la tienne.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Il me semble qu’Hurlevent considère ton espèce comme nuisible.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Pas besoin d’ennemis avec de tels alliés.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Si je dois accepter de l’aide, autant que ce soit la tienne.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_RehgarSW00=(outré) C’est une peau de loup que je vois sur ta tête ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Nous ? Alliés ? Je te tuerai aussi dès que nous en aurons fini.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Nous sommes peut-être rois tous les deux, mais c’est moi qui dirige la meute !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond00=Un vrai Gilnéen est toujours prêt.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond01=J’ai connu nombre de guerres. Celle-ci ne sera pas différente.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond02=Attends de voir ce qui arrive quand on me pousse à bout.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Ana00=Attends de voir ce qui arrive quand on me pousse à bout.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Ne mets pas ma patience à l’épreuve !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Tout ce que j’ai fait, je l’ai fait pour Gilnéas. Tu n’as jamais agi que pour toi-même.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Baelog00=Silence ! Ou tu feras connaissance avec mes crocs.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=J’espérais avoir des alliés fiables, mais je vais devoir me contenter de toi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Erik00=Un WORGEN ! Je suis un WOR-GEN !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Kael'thas00=Mon peuple est peut-être devenu worgen, mais tu as failli changer le tien en démons.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Quel genre de compétences, au juste ? Mener ton peuple à la ruine, ou te faire décapiter par lui ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Lunara00=Et toi, ma biche ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=Aujourd’hui, je m’acquitte de la dette que mon peuple a envers toi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ha ! Quand on pense qu’une créature telle que toi peut semer tant de chaos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Si ça ne tenait qu’à moi, tu serais dans le camp adverse.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=Nos destins sont liés.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=De toutes les personnes présentes, tu es l’une des rares en qui j’ai confiance.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_RehgarSW00=(condescendant) Ah, Rehgar. L’orc qui voulait être loup.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Et ton peuple pourrait bien perdre le sien.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Tu te PRENDS pour un loup. Mais moi, je SUIS le loup.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill00=Tombe sous mes coups !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill01=Tu n’avais aucune chance.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill02=Crève comme le chien que tu es.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill03=Voilà toute l’hospitalité que Gilnéas t’offrira.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill04=<Ahem> Suivant !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas00=Terenas, que ceci me rachète à tes yeux.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas_W00=J’ai réussi là où Terenas a échoué.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh00=Maintenant, passons au reste de ta misérable Horde.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh_W00=Face à moi, Lo’gosh est le cadet de tes soucis.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKael'thas00=Retourne donc dans ton Puits de soleil chéri.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKaelthas_W00=Ça t’apprendra à me roussir le poil.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric00=Tel est le destin de tous les rois indignes.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric_W00=Ne t’en fais pas, Léoric. Je veillerai à enterrer tes os. (ricane)
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara00=Peut-être qu’après tout, la nature avait besoin d’être protégée des humains.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara_W00=Les vents semblent m’avoir souri, cette fois.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion00=Je regrette, archidruide, mais il fallait que ce soit fait.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion_W00=Peut-être avais-tu raison, Malfurion : cette « forme de la meute » est bel et bien dangereuse.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpreeEnd00=J’ai failli voir rouge.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpree_W00=Je suis le mâle alpha !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas00=Justice pour Liam ! Justice pour Gilnéas !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas_W00=Enfin, je répands le pus qui te sert de sang !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther00=Tu étais un héros de l’Alliance… mais pas de Gilnéas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther_W00=J’ai toujours su que je t’enterrerais, Uther.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillVarian_W00=C’est quoi, le texte ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W00=C’est MA victime !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W01=Grâce à toi, mes griffes sont aiguisées.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W02=Une proie si facile…
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W03=Tuer, ça creuse.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W04=Personne ne fait ça mieux que moi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh00=<Hearty, good natured laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh01=<Derisive laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh02=<Vindictive laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh03=<Amused, but subdued laugh>

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh_W09=<Laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal00=Gloire à toi, soigneur.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal01=Gilnéas vivra tant que je vivrai.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal02=Un peu d’humanité dans ce monde de brutes. Merci.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W00=<Gasps> Il était moins une. Merci.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W01=Tiré des mâchoires de la mort...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W02=Je te dois la vie, soigneur.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana00=Pas assez de mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana01=Il me faut plus de mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana02=Je n’ai plus beaucoup de mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W00=Je vais tomber à court de mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W01=Mon mana est bas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W02=Je dois retrouver du mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No00=Jamais.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No01=Non.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No02=Refusé.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W00=Je ne peux pas faire ça.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W01=Impossible.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W02=Je refuse.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Notre allié est en mauvaise posture !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero_W00=Un membre de la meute a besoin de nous !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Venez m’aider !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Regroupez-vous sur ma position !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W00=Attaquez avec moi !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W01=Soyons unis !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Finissons-en ! Détruisons leur idole !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle_W00=Donnons le coup de grâce ! Détruisons leur idole !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Prenez ce camp pour grossir nos rangs !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc_W00=Montrez qui est le patron à ces mercenaires.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Le moment est venu de raser le fort ennemi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost_W00=Démantelons ce fort !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Privez-les de cette tour !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower_W00=Prenez cette tour de guet !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Défendez l’idole !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle_W00=Éloignez-les de notre idole !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Notre fort ne peut pas tomber !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost_W00=Défendez notre territoire !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Maintenez notre contrôle sur la tour de guet !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower_W00=Ne les laissez pas détruire notre tour !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero00=Taillez nos ennemis en pièces !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero_W00=Tuez !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed00=Oui ? Expliquez-vous !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed01=Respectez le protocole quand vous vous adressez à moi !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed02=Vous me rendez nerveux et vous n’avez aucun intérêt à ce que je le sois.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed03=J’ai envoyé croupir des idiots aux oubliettes pour moins que ça.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed04=Jadis, j’ai érigé un mur colossal pour isoler mon peuple du reste du monde. Vous me rappelez maintenant pourquoi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed05=Gilnéas reconquise, elle devra être rebâtie. Je me demande si ces Défias sont toujours sur le marché…
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed06=Hmm ? Bien sûr que c’est une épée d’opérette. Mon arme, c’est le fusil, sombre crétin.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed07=Je voulais mettre une tête de loup sur le drapeau de Gilnéas, mais mes avocats m’en ont dissuadé.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed08=Le mur de Grisetête empêchait tout contact avec le monde extérieur. Heureusement que personne ne pouvait survoler de bâtiments élevés ou se téléporter à des endroits connus en Azeroth.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed09=Ce fusil est un fleuron de l’industrie gilnéenne. C’est un gros calibre qui permet de tirer plus vite que son ombre.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed10=Le donjon d’Ombrecroc, vous connaissez ? Je le fréquentais dans ma jeunesse, mais aujourd’hui, le personnel change sans arrêt, c’est décevant.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed11=Gilnéas a vécu en vase clos pendant vingt ans. Vous m’excuserez donc de ne pas saisir toutes les références auxquelles vous faites allusion, vous les jeunes.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed12=La pleine lune ? Cette nuit ? Non ! Mais je vais me transformer en monstre ! Non, je vous fais marcher… Je peux me métamorphoser et vous égorger quand je veux !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed13=Un jour, un Réprouvé a frappé à la porte Nord et a dit « Je vais souffler et souffler jusqu’à ce que vos murailles s’écroulent ! » On a bien rigolé et puis on lui a jeté de la poix bouillante. Et on a encore plus rigolé !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed14=Saviez-vous que par temps clair, le mur de Grisetête est l’une des rares structures qu’on aperçoit depuis le Néant distordu ? Si, si, je vous assure !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W00=Que me voulez-vous ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W01=Parlez.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W02=<Menacing growl>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W03=Si c’est pour me demander où passe mon épée quand je me transforme, ne vous fatiguez pas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W04=Ces « taurens » n’avaient pas encore rejoint la Horde quand j’ai muré Gilnéas. J’ai cru comprendre qu’ils étaient des bovins humanoïdes ? Des « hommes-vaches » ? C’est d’un ridicule !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W05=Les elfes de la nuit furent les premiers worgens. Ils ne peuvent pas s’empêcher d’être premiers en tout.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W06=Au plus profond de la forêt Noire, les worgens se rassemblent sous un arbre géant qui apaise leur nature bestiale. C’est un endroit reposant. Mais l’odeur y est insoutenable.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W07=Vous connaissez l’histoire du garçon qui criait au loup ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W08=Vous m’avez entendu chanter ? Maintenant, allez écouter le renard et la belette.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W09=Ce costume, c’est de l’astrakan. J’imagine que ça fait de moi un loup déguisé en agneau. Je n’ai plus qu’à trouver une bergerie !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W10=<Grunts> Saletés de puces ! Rah, c’est encore vous !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W11=Je ne crains rien ni personne ! À part peut-être une visite chez le véto.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W12=Je vous assure, j’adore les chats… surtout au petit déjeuner.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W13=Certains disent que je dirige Gilnéas d’une patte de fer. Mais j’ai une excuse : l’homme est un loup pour l’homme.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W14=Quand deux Gilnéens se marient, ça fait un pacte des loups. <Chuckles at his own joke>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected00=Les forts survivent !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected01=Je t’ai en bonne grâce, soigneur
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive00=Gilnéas triomphera.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive01=J’ai survécu à bien pire que ça.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive02=Je ne décevrai pas mon peuple une nouvelle fois !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec00=Naturellement.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec01=Un choix digne.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec02=La malédiction se propage…
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec03=La persuasion est l’arme des rois.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec04=Je me bats comme quatre.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W00=Bien choisi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W01=Ah, voilà un os à ronger.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W02=J’obéis à la voix de mon maître, moi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W03=Mi-bête, mi-homme, 200% worgen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W04=J’entends l’appel de Goldrinn.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt00=Tu ne fais pas le poids face à moi !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt01=Je vais t’exécuter froidement.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt02=Comment oses-tu défier le roi de Gilnéas !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W00=Je sens votre peur.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W01=Seul un inconscient défierait un loup alpha !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W02=Prends tes jambes à ton cou, petit.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/TeamKilled00=Montrez-leur la force de notre meute !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExLocked00=Laissez libre cours à ma rage !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExLocked_W00=Plus rien ne retient ma rage.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ma malédiction sera ma plus grande arme.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExPurchased_W00=Ma malédiction, mon arme.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Gift00=Je méprisais la charité. Aujourd’hui, je vois son utilité.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Gift_W00=Un cadeau ? Intéressant.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Lockin00=Gilnéas renaîtra !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Purchase00=Je suis le chef de meute !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Purchase_W00=Je suis le chef de meute !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Trial00=Allons nous dégourdir les pattes, voulez-vous ?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Trial01=Vous doutez de ma force ? Préparez-vous à un choc.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Gilnéas a subi un siège de plusieurs années. J’ai eu tout le temps de me préparer au combat.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked01=L’hésitation est un signe de faiblesse.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked_W00=Ne me faites pas attendre. J’ai hâte de me battre.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked_W01=L’hésitation est un signe de faiblesse.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Un vrai meneur se doit d’être en première ligne.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Un loup qui s’ennuie n’est pas le plus sûr des compagnons.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased_W00=Un vrai meneur se doit d’être en première ligne.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased_W01=Un loup qui s’ennuie n’est pas le plus sûr des compagnons.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used00=Tu ne peux pas m’échapper !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used01=Désigné pour mourir !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used02=Maintenant, c’est toi la proie !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used00=Ma rage se déchaîne !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used01=Je vais vous déchiqueter !
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used02=La bête est libérée !

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Très bien, allons les rapporter.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Nous devrions aller déposer tout ça.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed00=Quel est le plan ?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed01=Chut… J’essaie de réfléchir…
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed02=Je ne rêvais que d’une chose : étudier… et puis un démon géant est venu détruire ma maison… Ça m’a un peu forcée à revoir mes priorités.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed03=Je me demande si mon sort de téléportation fonctionnerait ici. Où est passé ce sort ? Ah, le voilà ! Azeroth metrion zinthos. Une seconde, ça ne colle pas…
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed04=Bon, oubliez tout ce que j’ai dit avant… MAINTENANT ça devient vraiment bizarre. J’ai quand même aperçu un nain en bonbons !
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed05=Oh, c’est un cheveu blanc, ça ? J’espère que ce n’est pas mauvais signe.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed06=Ça fait quand même du bien de sortir de temps en temps. J’ai l’impression d’être restée cloîtrée dans une tour pendant des années.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed07=Mais pourquoi tout le monde appelle ça « moutonner » ? Le terme technique, c’est « ovimorphose », un point c’est tout !
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed08=Je suis une sorcière, et une sacrée bonne sorcière, avec tout mon entraînement.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed09=Désormais, ma place est ici, dans le Nexus, où je peux être moi-même et... <SFX: ice block magical sound> faire mal autour de moi.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed10=Je l’ai comme envoûté, oui comme ensorcelé. J’ai le truc pour jouer avec son cœur.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed11=Je le dis tout net : ce ne sont pas des « tours de magie »… ce sont des illusions ! Les « tours », c’est bon pour animer les goûters d’anniversaire.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed12=Pardon ? Quoi ? Thrall et moi ? Beurk… Mais qui peut répéter des horreurs pareilles ? (pause) En plus, tout le monde sait que je préfère le bleu au vert.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed13=Sans parler du fait que les deux derniers hommes qui se sont intéressés à moi ont voulu conquérir le monde. Vraiment, il vaut mieux que je me contente d’étudier…
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed14=La Horde et l’Alliance peuvent coexister, je l’ai vu. Un seul évènement peut suffire à nous rapprocher.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed15=J’espère qu’ils vont me donner une monture spéciale, comme un traîneau tiré par des ours polaires… Si personne ne l'a déjà pris.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed16=Quand mon frère Derek a été tué, mon père a fait le serment éternel de massacrer tous les orcs sur Azeroth… Je me demande comment j’aurais réagi à une telle perte. Franchement, j’espère ne jamais avoir la réponse.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed_Evo00=Quel… plan ?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed_Evo01=Tentative de réflexion…
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Resurrected00=Merci beaucoup.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Resurrected01=Je suis heureuse de t’avoir avec moi !

VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart01=Tu es le prochain à tomber.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart02=Je déteste avoir recours à la violence, mais pour toi je vais faire une exception.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive00=Il m’en faut plus que ça pour rester au tapis.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive01=Dépêchons-nous, nos alliés ont besoin de nous.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive02=Bon, on oublie tout et on recommence.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Dance00=C’est juste un tout petit peu magique.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes00=À l’assaut.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes01=Ton conseil me sied.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes02=Va pour le massacre !
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes03=J’apprécie votre loyauté.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes04=Les damnés avancent.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes05=Tremblez devant votre roi !
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes06=Oui.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes07=Il en sera ainsi.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes08=Avec votre permission.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes09=Immédiatement.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Attack00=Écrasez-les. Sans faiblir.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Attack01=Submergez-les et ils finiront par céder.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Attack02=Percez leurs rangs. Ils ne peuvent rien contre notre fureur.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Caution00=Attention. Mourir maintenant serait plus que mal venu.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_GoodJob00=Rudimentaire, mais efficace.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_GoodJob01=Vous vous en êtes sortis… passablement.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_GoodJob02=Un autre adversaire tombe sous nos coups.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Heal00=Va te soigner. Les alliés blessés ne me sont d’aucune utilité.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Heal01=Occupe-toi de tes blessures, avant qu’elles ne s’occupent de toi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Retreat00=Ne m’attendez pas.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Retreat01=Il est temps de changer de stratégie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Uhoh00=Cette faute était la dernière.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Uhoh01=Les serviteurs inefficaces ne me sont d’aucune utilité.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Uhoh02=Je ne tolère pas l’échec.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack00=Pour l’empire éternel.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack01=Je perçois de la force... Mais je la briserai.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack02=Ni pitié, ni absolution.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack03=La trahison doit être détruite à la racine.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack04=Écrasez toute résistance.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack05=Subissez ma haine !
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack06=Tombez sous mes coups.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Celebrate00=Excellent.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Celebrate01=Comme je l’avais prévu.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Healed01=Un talent utile. Continue.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Healed02=Bien. Continue à me servir, guérisseur.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree00=J’espère que je ne serai pas déçu...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree01=Votre fureur sera une puissante alliée.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree02=Cette fois, nul ne pourra nous arrêter.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroBoast00=J’ai conquis des milliers de mondes. Celui-ci ne fera pas exception. 
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroBoast01=Le pouvoir des ténèbres causera leur perte.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion00=J’espère que vous êtes prêts pour la guerre qui nous attend.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion01=Êtes-vous prêts ?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Tu as du mal à contrôler les ténèbres, je le sens. Tu n’en es pas digne.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Je peux sentir ta vraie nature, démon. Les ténèbres sont moins présentes que chez d’autres, mais c’est suffisant pour me servir.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Intéressant. Tu ne montres aucune peur face à un seigneur des ténèbres…
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Hmm. Les ténèbres et la lumière s’affrontent en toi. Nulle créature ne peut servir deux maîtres indéfiniment.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Une créature faite de pures ténèbres… Sers l’empire éternel et je te laisserai vivre.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Ta puissance servira l’empire éternel, démon. Si tu résistes, nous nous en emparerons par la force.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Monk00=Je ne perçois que du calme en toi, humain. Comment se fait-il que tu ne sois pas déjà mort ?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Il y a trop de colère en toi. Rejoins-moi et tu pourras assouvir ta vengeance.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Ne t’en fait pas. J’ai conquis des mondes à moi seul auparavant…
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Vous pourrez sans doute m’être utile. Nous avons tous deux intérêt à ce que ce soit le cas.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Une créature de lumière… L’empire éternel a déjà affronté tes semblables par le passé. Ce fut délectable.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond00=Votre manque de foi me consterne.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond01=Et je pourrais retourner la question.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond02=De quoi je me mêle ?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Ana00=Tu m’es utile ; je vais donc ignorer ton insolence pour l’instant.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Ah, un roi qui croit commander aux morts… Pourtant, tout porte à croire le contraire. 
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Tu le sauras bientôt.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Je crois bien qu’on ne m’a pas appelé ainsi depuis… Recommence, et tu vas le regretter.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Tu es en vie parce que je le veux bien. Ne me fais pas regretter ma générosité.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Demon00=Tu m’es utile ; je vais donc ignorer ton insolence pour l’instant.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Ce ton me rappelle un tas de gens qui ne sont plus de ce monde. Tu devrais faire attention.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Monk00=Je ne suis pas celui auquel tu penses, humain. Estime-toi heureux de ne pas me connaître.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Murky00=Si tel est ton souhait, libère ta colère. Seule ta haine peut les détruire. 
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Negative00=Assez.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Positive00=Assez de banalités… Nous avons beaucoup à faire.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Oui, créature de lumière… Succombe à la peur, que l’obscurité te consume.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill00=Bien trop facile.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill01=Quel manque de conviction.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill02=L’empire ne tolère pas les traîtres.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill03=Un spectacle insignifiant.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill04=Fin de l’histoire.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillArthas00=La mort t’entoure, mais elle n’obéit qu’à son maître.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillAzmodan00=Pourquoi te rebeller, démon ? Nous avons les mêmes desseins.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillBarbarian00=Tu as déjà envisagé de porter une armure ?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillButcher00=Toute cette colère... Toute cette haine. Tu me seras utile, créature.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillCrusader00=Je te trouve un peu trop bavarde, croisée.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDemonHunter00=Tu crois que l’obscurité est ton alliée. Tu n’as fait qu’adopter la pénombre, moi je suis né dedans.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDiablo00=Diablo, l’empire éternel saurait utiliser ta puissance. Rejoins-moi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillMonk00=Tu peux prier tous les dieux que tu voudras. Aucun ne te sauvera de moi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillSpreeEnd00=Même les meilleurs d’entre vous tremblent devant moi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillTyrael00=Comme c’est étrange. Est-ce vraiment un ange, ou un vulgaire être de lumière qui tente de se faire passer pour tel ?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillUther00=Ceux qui manient la lumière connaîtront l’extinction.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWitchDoctor00=Tu joues avec un pouvoir qui dépasse ta compréhension.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWizard00=Tu… Tu n’es pas elle… Mais ta mort me réjouit tout de même.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal00=Des soins magistraux. La force est de nouveau avec moi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal01=L’heure de ma mort n’est pas encore arrivée.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal02=Il s’en est fallu de peu, cette fois.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana00=Je manque de mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana01=Non, je n’ai pas assez de mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana02=Il me faut du mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No00=C’est impossible.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No01=Ne m’oblige pas à te tuer.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No02=Jamais.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistHero00=Notre allié est en mauvaise posture.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe00=Avec moi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe01=À moi, vite !
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackCastle00=L’idole ! Détruisez-la !
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackMerc00=Allez « convaincre » ces mercenaires de nous rejoindre.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Faites voler leurs fortifications en éclats.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackTower00=La tour de guet nous serait d’une grande utilité.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendCastle00=Défendons notre idole !
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Ce fort ne doit pas tomber.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendTower00=Défendez cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_KillHero00=Montrez le pouvoir des ténèbres à ce héros.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed00=Quoi encore ?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed01=Vous jouez avec ma patience… C’est très imprudent de votre part.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed02=L’empire éternel a consumé de nombreux mondes. Leur puissance est désormais mienne grâce aux ténèbres.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed03=Sous mon commandement, nous avons toujours écrasé nos adversaires. Pourquoi ces princesses des étoiles sont-elles si coriaces ? Et non, ce n’est pas le pouvoir de l’amour. Arrêtez de dire ça, c’est idiot.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed04=Obscure, la force est noire. Noire comme le château...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed05=Marché conclu… Non, attendez, je change les termes du contrat ! Ah, c’est beaucoup mieux. Hmm, je pourrais les changer encore davantage... Oui, OUI ! On y arrive.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed06=Vous sous-estimez le pouvoir des ténèbres, mais vous ne devriez pas. Elles sont capables du pire, comme laisser des petits mots assassins sur le frigo… Oui, oui.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed07=Si vous construisez une arme ultime aux dimensions complètement folles, ne lésinez pas sur le contrôle qualité. La moindre négligence peut mener à la catastrophe.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed08=Toujours par deux les seigneurs de l’espace vont. Le maître et son apprenti.  Nos rencontres sont solitaires... et unilatérales.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed09=Oui, le pouvoir des ténèbres ressemble à un genre d’hologramme rouge. Et alors ?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed10=<angry exertion>Cette visière est toujours pleine de buée. <SFX: Squeegee sounds>Ah, c’est beaucoup mieux.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed11=Certains trouvent le nom de l’empire éternel présomptueux. Pardon, certains le « trouvaient » présomptueux. Le passé s’impose quand on parle de morts.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed12=Ces lumières scintillantes ne servent à rien. Mais quitte à avoir un corps robotique, autant ne pas lésiner sur la décoration.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed13=Dans tout space opera qui se respecte, il faut forcément que l'extraterrestre obèse se mette à chanter.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed14=Vous n’avez aucune idée du nombre de piles que je consomme.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed15=Personne ne le dit jamais, mais l’espace est vraiment un endroit ennuyeux. C’est vaste, plutôt vide et les rares lieux habités le sont par des imbéciles.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected00=Servir à jamais, avec une loyauté éternelle.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected01=Bien joué, serviteur de l’empire.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive00=La boucle est maintenant bouclée.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive01=Je suis éternel, tout comme notre empire.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive02=Ah... Que l’inquisition continue.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive03=Vous pensiez être débarrassés de moi ?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive04=Je ne meurs pas. Je ne vis pas.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec00=Les ténèbres s’épaississent.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec01=Nos ennemis connaîtront la véritable souffrance.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec02=Hmm. Ingénieux.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec03=Vous ne me décevez pas.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec04=Bien, voilà qui sera utile.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt00=Insectes insignifiants.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt01=Venez et affrontez votre destin.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt02=Je vais m’occuper de vous personnellement.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/TeamKilled00=Nooon !
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExLocked00=J’espère qu’il y a une bonne raison à ce dérangement.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah, une présence familière…
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Gift00=Comme vous voulez.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Lockin00=Cette galaxie connaîtra la souffrance.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Purchase00=Gloire à l’empire éternel.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial00=Ah, un nouveau monde à soumettre.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial01=Vous voulez une démonstration de force ? Laissez-moi faire.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked00=Rejoignez-moi et cette galaxie pliera devant nous.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked01=Ma patience a ses limites.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased00=Sachez que quand vous serez lassé d’attendre, je resterai à mon tour impassible.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased01=Tant d’étoiles.… Toutes destinées à me servir un jour.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used00=Nul n’échappe à son destin.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used01=Cette fois, je te tiens.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used02=Bienvenue dans l’arène du destin.

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed12=Les marines adorent les potins. Ils répandent des rumeurs, comme quoi on utiliserait des agrafeuses pour refermer les plaies. Les idiots... Moi j’ai un pistolet à clous. Les agrafes, ça coûte cher.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed13=Y a pas à dire, ce nouvel équipement est top... Minute, pas de fusée aveuglante ? Vraiment ? Hmm... J’aime bien le lance-grenades, mais ça va me manquer d’aveugler les gens.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed14=Regardez ! Il y a un avertissement. Ce rayon de soins n’a pas encore reçu l'aval des autorités sanitaires. Évitez de prendre le contrôle d'appareils imposants ou de créatures mythiques après utilisation.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed15=Des effets secondaires peuvent subvenir, tels que nausées, désorientation, irritations intestinales et suppurations douloureuses. Consultez un médecin avant toute utilisation du rayon de soins.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed16=Hmm... Je devrais peut-être utiliser ce truc uniquement sur les AUTRES.

VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitLocked01=On peut y aller quand vous voulez.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Argh, ce bouclier pèse une tonne. On peut y aller ?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Écoutez, plus de cent personnes meurent chaque minute. Vous ne devriez pas perdre trop de temps.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used00=Nano-stimulants déployés.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used01=Ça devrait faire l’affaire.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used02=Et voilà, soldat.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used03=Envoi de stimulants en cours.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used04=Stimulants activés.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed00=Et vous, où mène votre chemin ?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed01=J’ai été choisi par les mille et un dieux pour servir les patriarches d’Ivgorod.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed02=Je n’imaginais pas que mon chemin me mène ici, mais il l’a fait.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed03=Commencez par méditer sur votre action. Vous n’agirez ensuite qu’avec plus de sagesse… Enfin, c’est à espérer.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed04=J’ai parcouru de nombreux pays et rencontré une foule de gens. Chez eux, la sagesse était aussi rare qu’un joyau niché au sommet d’une montagne.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed05=Jadis, j’ai voyagé avec un guerrier candide qui n’avait foi qu’en des mensonges, un dieu qui ne croyait pas en sa propre utilité et un sage ancien qui ne racontait que des stupidités.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed06=J’ai vu le jour sous le signe d’Ytar, dieu du soleil. Je porte ses attributs et j’entends ses préceptes.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed07=Je suis reconnaissant de ne pas être né sous le signe d’un dieu inférieur. Car il existe des dieux d’oisiveté et de négligence et nombreux sont ceux qui les servent à la perfection.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed08=Je ne suis pas chauve, vous savez. Je me rase le crâne par piété.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed09=J’ai frappé d’innombrables planches de bois et jeûné pendant des jours et des jours d’affilée. Mais les tatouages sur mon visage restent ma plus douloureuse expérience…
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed10=Mon cœur est droit. Mon esprit est pur. Mes mantras sont… cohérents.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed11=Quand vous utilisez la paume explosive, souvenez-vous toujours d’une chose : votre paume n’est pas censée exploser pour de vrai.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed12=Videz votre esprit. Soyez informe. Informe comme le feu. Si vous mettez du feu dans une tasse, il consume la tasse, puis la table où elle repose, et même la maison qui l’entoure. Soyez le feu, mon ami. Pas la tasse.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed13=Je vois que vous servez Sovyat, le dieu de ceux qui cliquent intempestivement. Il doit être très fier de vous.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed14=Vous devez vaincre Shen-Long pour avoir une chance de survivre. Et il est mort depuis des millénaires, donc bonne chance.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed15=Si vous êtes venu pour combattre, vous êtes sûr de vous faire battre.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected00=Vous accomplissez l’œuvre des dieux, mon ami.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected01=Mon ami, notre sacerdoce continue.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive00=Les dieux me prient de persévérer !
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive01=Mon heure n’est pas encore venue.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive02=Je sers à nouveau.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec00=Mon entendement s’enrichit.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec01=Mon chemin s’illumine.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec04=Mon esprit devient plus fort.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt00=Seriez-vous un partisan de l’autodestruction ?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt01=Affrontez-moi, et vous connaîtrez l’échec.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt02=Les dieux réprouvent votre faiblesse.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/TeamKilled00=Ceci n’est qu’un test. Nous le réussirons.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExLocked00=Je suis le poing des dieux.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Je maintiendrai l’équilibre.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Gift00=Je vois que mon aide est requise ailleurs.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Lockin00=Ytar, guide-moi.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Purchase00=Les dieux vous ont gratifié de sagesse.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial00=Une épreuve ? Excellent.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial01=Ah, permettez-moi de vous montrer quelques techniques.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Ceux qui ne font rien n’arrivent à rien.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Le temps ne s’arrête jamais. Je devrais suivre son exemple.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=À vaincre sans péril, on triomphe sans gloire.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Les dieux ne récompensent pas ceux qui ne font rien.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used00=Les dieux frappent par ma main !
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used01=Subissez le courroux d’Ytar !

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_GoodJob01=Mmm. J’ai connu des combats plus difficiles.

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_GoodJob03=Oh, ça m’avait manqué.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Heal00=Tu sens la mort. Va laver cette puanteur à la fontaine de soins.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Heal01=Je me soignerais si j’étais toi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Retreat00=Je crois qu’il est temps de faire ma sortie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Retreat01=Je retourne en ville… euh, au hall des… enfin, peu importe son nom.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Uhoh00=<soupire>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Uhoh01=Je l’avais vu venir.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Uhoh02=Un autre allié entre les mains de la mort.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack00=Je vais te faire taire.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack01=Comme en a décidé l’équilibre.

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Healed00=Merci, guérisseur.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Healed01=De la magie de soins… Désuet, mais utile.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Healed02=C’est exquis.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroAgree00=Oh… Vous le promettez ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroAgree01=Je n’y vois pas d’inconvénient.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroAgree02=Je crois que ça va me plaire.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroBoast00=Gare à ceux qui s’opposent à moi…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroBoast01=Ceux qui perturbent l’équilibre seront défaits.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion00=Êtes-vous prêts ? La bataille va commencer.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion01=Hmm… Vous êtes certains d’être prêts pour ça ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Un boucher. Content que tu sois de notre côté.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Vous venez de Sanctuaire… Vous pourrez peut-être me dire pourquoi mon portail de retour en ville ne fonctionne pas.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Ainsi, vous faites partie de la nouvelle génération. Vous croyez que vous arriverez à suivre le rythme d’un vieil homme ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Une fois ce combat terminé, le nôtre pourra commencer, démon.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Penses-tu pouvoir mettre nos différends de côté le temps d’une bataille, Diablo ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Dismissive00=Oh, c’est toi… Et dire que tout se passait bien…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Dryad00=Une aura de magie naturelle t’enveloppe… Intéressant.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=<Do not record. Reuses introboast.>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Par les Enfers, qu’est-ce que tu es ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Essaie de ne pas mourir. Je n’aimerais pas devoir invoquer un squelette à partir de ton cadavre.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Bien. Un allié puissant.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Archange Tyraël, quel plaisir de vous voir continuer le combat pour l’équilibre.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Wizard00=Fais attention, mage… Ceux de ton espèce ont déjà perturbé l’équilibre par le passé. 
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond00=La mort est une vieille amie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond01=Ne doutez jamais de mes talents.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond02=Je le suis.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Tu te moques d’un prêtre de Rathma à tes risques et périls.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Ah, oui… Ce qui explique ta présence. Très bien.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Charmant.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Ça fait longtemps pour toi uniquement…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Hmm… Un Nephalem… Donc la légende dit vrai. Ça devrait être intéressant.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Je n’ai jamais frayé avec des démons. Et je n’ai nulle intention de commencer aujourd’hui.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Je sais… Dommage que tu ne puisses pas. Aurais-tu oublié notre dernier affrontement ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Garde ton vitriol pour quelqu’un que ça intéresse.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=Allons… La mort a toujours été là.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Ah… C’est puéril, non ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=J’en ai froid dans le dos.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Seules les actions nous permettront d’en finir. Pas les paroles.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Viens, nous maintiendrons l’équilibre ensemble.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Tyraël… Heureux de voir que vous avez survécu à la destruction de la Pierre-Monde.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Wizard00=Tu connais mon apprenti ? Comme c’est étrange.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill00=Un cadavre de plus.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill01=Ta fin est proche.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill02=Ne doutez jamais de mes talents.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill03=Il en faut plus pour m’arrêter.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill04=L’équilibre a été instauré.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill05=Ha ! Une oreille de plus pour ma collection…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillArthas00=Ce n’est qu’un enfant se prenant pour le dieu de la mort.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillAzmodan00=Pff. Duriel était plus résistant… Et c’était un asticot géant.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillD3Hero00=Et je ne suis même pas un Nephalem.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDeath00=Eh bien, ça fait un « maître de la mort » de moins dans le Nexus.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDemon00=L’équilibre sera maintenu, démon.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDiablo00=Seigneur Diablo, quelle médiocrité !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillLeoric00=Un mort-vivant qui refuse d’obéir ne m’est d’aucune utilité.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillMephisto00=Bon voyage, Méphisto. Mes amitiés aux abîmes.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillSpreeEnd00=La puissance de la mort est à mon service.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillTyrael00=Mes excuses, ange. Mais ceux qui perturbent l’équilibre doivent disparaître.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillUndead00=Quel gâchis de chair vivante.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillWitchDoctor00=Les morts doivent nous servir, féticheur, pas l’inverse.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillZeratul00=Tu as raison… Les faux, c’est vraiment génial.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh00=<ricane>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh01=<rire modéré>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh02=<rire franc>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh03=<rire agressif - après avoir tué un ennemi>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh04=<rire agressif - après avoir tué un ennemi>

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ah, c’est bien meilleur que ces potions répugnantes.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal01=L’étreinte glacée de la mort se relâche.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal02=Beau travail, soigneur… Excellent, même.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana00=J’ai besoin de… mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana01=Pas assez de mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana02=Je donnerais cher pour une potion de mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No00=Ha. Non.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No01=Je ne peux pas.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No02=Impossible.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No03=Pourquoi ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Notre allié est en danger.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe00=J'ai besoin d'aide !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Venez m’aider !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Détruisez leur idole !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Capturez ce camp de mercenaires.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Réduisons ce fort à néant.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Hmm… cette tour de guet nous serait utile.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Défendons notre idole !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Notre fort doit être défendu.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Ne les laissons pas s’emparer de cette tour de guet !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_KillHero00=La mort appelle ce héros.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed00=Quoi encore ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed01=Vous avez besoin de me déranger ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed02=Hmm ? Oh oui, la faux. C’est nouveau pour moi aussi, mais je dois admettre… que je commence à l’apprécier.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed03=Il n’y a que deux choses auxquelles on ne peut échapper… la mort et… Hmm. Vous savez quoi ? J’ai oublié la deuxième… Oh, bon, on n’a qu’à dire la mort et… la mort.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed04=Oh... La mort vous irait si bien…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed05=Nous, les prêtres de Rathma, sommes chargés de maintenir l’équilibre, mais il semble que beaucoup ne savent pas ce que c’est.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed06=L’équilibre est comme un filet… Un filet de sécurité mystérieux qui empêche les êtres insignifiants roses et mous tels que vous d’être consumés par l’oubli. Mon travail est de préserver ce filet. Maintenant, dites-moi merci !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed07=Le chef des nécromanciens est surnommé le nécrorateur. Je vous laisse deviner son sujet de conversation préféré…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed08=À mon époque, personne ne vous croyait si vous disiez que les Nephalem existaient… et pourtant, les voilà… et ils sont six, en plus ! C’est un peu excessif… vous ne trouvez pas ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed09=Vous trouvez ça difficile ? Ha ! Vous ne jouez même pas en mode Extrême !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed10=On récolte ce que l’on sème… et j’ai semé la mort.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed11=Oui, je ramène les morts à la vie, mais c’est pas beau à voir…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed12=Pour la dernière fois, un nécromancien n’est pas amoureux des morts… ça c’est un nécroph… Bref, peu importe.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed13=Un jour, je vais devoir trouver quoi faire de toutes les oreilles que j’ai collectées. Une ceinture peut-être…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed14=Sortez vos morts, qu’ils disaient ? Ça me va…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed15=Maintenir l’équilibre est difficile. Mais en aidant un ange par-ci, et en battant un démon par-là, on obtient des résultats.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected00=Je reviens… mais pas sous forme de cadavre. Il va falloir m’apprendre à faire ça.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected01=Une véritable résurrection ? Cette prouesse ne devrait pas être possible…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive00=Alors voilà à quoi ressemble la mort… Ça me manque déjà.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive01=Le grand cycle des réincarnations reprend une nouvelle fois.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive02=On dirait qu’il y a encore beaucoup à faire.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive03=Hmm ? Pas de cadavre à retrouver ? Oh, ça me plaît.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec00=Intéressant…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec01=Voilà qui me sera profitable.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec02=Comme il se doit.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec03=C’est intelligent de votre part…
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec04=Aaah. Un choix logique.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt00=Tu as rendez-vous... avec la mort.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt01=Tu as raison de me craindre, mais ça ne te servira à rien.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt02=Je sens… la vie… en toi. Permets-moi de t’en débarrasser.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/TeamKilled00=Ne laissez pas la mort vous abattre. Utilisez-la pour vous venger.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExLocked00=La mort est à ma solde.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah… un visage familier.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Gift00=Une belle preuve de générosité.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Lockin00=Le moment est venu.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Purchase00=Me revoilà.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial00=Voilà qui devient intéressant.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial01=Je vois, un peu d’entraînement ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked00=On y va ?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Venez éprouver mes pouvoirs… J’aspire à retourner sur le champ de bataille.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=<Brrr> J’aurais dû prendre une petite laine.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hmm. Battle.net est bien plus beau qu’avant.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used00=Nova de poison !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used01=Corruption fétide !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used02=Souffle souillé des morts.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used03=Essence nocive.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used00=Goûtez à la froideur de la mort.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used01=L’étreinte de la mort se rapproche de vous.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used02=Levez-vous et servez-moi !
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used03=Il est temps de freiner vos ardeurs !

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Hum, je déteste rester sur le banc de touche.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Comment fait Thrall pour toujours rester en place comme ça ?

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_Capture01=Seize this!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_Collect00=Gather these, quickly!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_Collect01=We should collect these.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_Danger00=Be careful.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_Danger01=Watch yourselves.

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_DestroyThing01=Kill this fool.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Our cowardly foes are missing.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_EnemyMissing01=The enemy evades us.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_KillHero00=Slaughter this "hero"!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_OnMyWay00=On my way.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_OnMyWay01=Heading to you.

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed00=We are the Forsaken.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed01=My will is my own.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed02=Fast is fine, but accurate is final.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed03=You have no idea how tough it is to do this in heels.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed04=I have no time for games.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed05=Being undead isn’t all bad. You get to eat whatever or whoever you want and not gain a pound. Although keeping your jaw from falling off, does take some practice... And a little string.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed06=Night elf? I don't know what you're talking about.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed07=<Handheld Game Noises> Okay, maybe I've got SOME time for games.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed08=Time flies like an arrow. Flesh flies like carrion.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed09=<sings> Shoot that poison arrow through my heart...
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed10=What are we, if not slaves to this torment?
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed11=I'm no different from any other girl... I still dream of a Death Knight in shining armor who rides up on a Phantom steed and sweeps me off my feet with the blade of his evil sword! Turns me undead, and... Oh right... that's my nightmare.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed12=And let me tell you, torment is a very picky master. "Fold the towels like this, set the table like that..."
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed13=No I was never in Night Ranger... but I have an all-dead girl group called band-she.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed14=Just keep poking me and see what happens, savage.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed_Evo00=We are... Forsaken.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed_Evo01=My will... my own.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Resurrected00=My undeath continues.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Resurrected01=I've returned.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeEnd00=Hardly worth the effort.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeEnd01=Cur.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeEnd02=You underestimate me, cretin.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeStart00=I'll never stop hunting you.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeStart01=I have plans for you, dog!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeStart02=You dare attack the Banshee Queen?
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Revive00=What joy is there in this curse?
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Revive01=Death cannot hold me.

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_WellPlayed00=Very clever of you.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_WellPlayed01=I couldn't have done it better.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec00=That will serve me well.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec01=Interesting.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec02=A wise selection.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec03=Good.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec04=Our victory is assured.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt03=Your presence offends me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt04=You will die first.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt05=I will spare no one.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt_Evo00=You... offend.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt_Evo01=You die.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt_Evo02=Sapre... no one.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/TeamKilled00=Do not fear, I have been through worse.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_ExLocked00=My only interest is vengeance.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_ExPurchased00=Our enemies will beg for death's release.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Gift00=How... noble.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Lockin00=Our foes may as well surrender now.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Purchase00=Your enemies are mine.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Trial00=A test then? So be it.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Trial01=You will not be disappointed.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitLocked00=Do it.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitLocked01=Unleash me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitPurchased00=I am not accustomed to waiting.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitPurchased01=Do not toy with me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate1Used00=Fly, banshee. Your queen commands you!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Fly... queen commands...
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate2Used00=Lights out!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate2Used01=Pay with your blood!

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes01=We shall be victorious!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes02=I will do so.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes03=Spare no one.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes04=They won't know what hit them.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes05=Yes.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes06=It will be done.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes07=Slaughter them all.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes08=So be it.

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo02=I do so.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Uhoh01=Ils sont en train de percer nos défenses !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Uhoh02=Davantage de recrues pour les Réprouvés…
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack00=La vengeance est proche…
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack01=Ne montrez aucune pitié.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack02=Continuez l’attaque !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack03=Le combat continue.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Healed01=Tu as ma gratitude… pour l’instant.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Healed02=Tout va bien maintenant.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroAgree00=Je n’en attends pas moins.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroAgree01=Assurément.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroAgree02=Déchaînons notre fureur.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion00=Vous êtes prêts à causer la perte de nos ennemis ?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion01=Vous avez intérêt à être prêts.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_BloodElf00=Sinu a’manore.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Forsaken00=La Dame noire a besoin de toi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Plus dure a été ta chute…
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_GennGreymane00=On dirait que ton peuple a perdu son dirigeant, en fin de compte.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Kaelthas00=Et revoilà notre petit prince de bac à sable.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Qu’est-ce que vous regardez, tous les trois ?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Tu serais parfait en mur’goule.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillArthas00=Tu transmettras mes hommages à la Ténèbre de l’au-delà…
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillBloodElf00=Shorel’aran, sindorei.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillGarrosh00=Pas d’avorton pour te sauver cette fois, Garrosh.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillKaelthas00=Une mauviette, tout comme ton père…
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillKerrigan00=Il n’y a qu’une reine ici. Tu n’es qu’un pion sur mon échiquier.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillSkeletonKing00=Je dirige les morts-vivants !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Je n’arrêterai jamais de me battre… Jamais.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillStitches00=Aucune créature du Fléau n’échappe à ma colère !

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal00=Des compliments sont de rigueur.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal01=La mort m’a épargnée !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ton service est satisfaisant, soigneur.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana00=Je n’ai plus beaucoup de mana.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana01=Il me faut plus de mana.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana02=Pas assez de mana pour ça.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No00=Abandonnez cette idée.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No01=<scoff> Non.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No02=Je diverge.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistHero00=J’imagine que tu dois aider notre allié.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistMe00=J’ai besoin d'aide !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Venez m’aider immédiatement !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Frappez-les où ils auront le plus mal : l’idole.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Nous devons « recruter » ces mercenaires.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Réduisez ce fort en charpie !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Prenez cette tour de guet !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Nous sommes condamnés si l’idole tombe. Défendez-la !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Protégez ce fort au péril de vos misérables existences !

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed01=Nous sommes les Réprouvés.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed02=Recommence et tu récupéreras un moignon.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed03=Le temps file comme une flèche, les mouches aiment la viande fraîche.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed04=La rapidité, c’est bien, mais pas autant que la précision.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed05=Tu n’imagines même pas le mal que j’ai à faire tout ça sur des talons hauts. Heureusement, la putréfaction a détruit mes terminaisons nerveuses.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed06=Je n’ai pas le temps de jouer ! Mais j’ai tout le temps d’apparaître dans des jeux… hmmm…
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed07=C’est à Fossoyeuse qu’il y a les meilleures fêtes de la Sanssaint. Tout le monde sait ça.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed08=Le courroux du roi-liche, c'était mignon mais attendez de voir le courroux de la reine banshee.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed09=Non, je ne vais pas chanter pour vous. Je suis une reine morte-vivante sans pitié, pas une boîte à musique.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed10=Je pensais être la seule à avoir été tuée par un homme cruel, ressuscitée sous la forme d’une créature horrible mais puissante, puis à m’être autoproclamée reine et à avoir employé mes sujets à assouvir ma vengeance. Et puis, j’ai rencontré Kerrigan !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed11=Écoutez, j’ai été une haute-elfe, une banshee, une haute-elfe morte-vivante, mais JAMAIS une elfe de la nuit. Alors arrêtez de croire que je vais me trémousser !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed12=Non, je n’ai jamais chanté avec le Forestier… mais je fais partie d’un groupe de death metal : les Réprouvées.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed13=Je suis la seule à entendre un bourdonnement ?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed14=Tourne, tourne, petit moulin. Crève, crève, petit malin…
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed15=Beurk ! C’est quoi, cette odeur ? C’est moi qui sens comme ça ?

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Revive00=Quelle joie trouve-t-on dans cette malédiction ?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Revive01=Il n’y a pas de repos pour moi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Revive02=Je n’ai pas le temps de jouer.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec00=Cela devrait suffire.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec01=Intéressant.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec02=Bien sûr.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec03=Excellent.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec04=La victoire est proche.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt00=Je vais t’apprendre à rester à ta place.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt01=Insulte-moi dans la vie et tu me serviras dans la mort.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt02=Je cherchais une cible à abattre… et te voilà.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/TeamKilled00=Rassurez-vous. J’ai survécu à bien pire que ça.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_ExLocked00=Soumettez-vous ou mourez.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_ExPurchased00=La Dame noire veille sur vous.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Gift00=Un geste… plein de noblesse.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Lockin00=Victoire aux Réprouvés !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Purchase00=Vous êtes un petit malin, à ce que je vois !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Trial00=N’ai-je pas déjà subi assez de mises à l’épreuve ?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Trial01=Tu badines avec une puissance qui te dépasse.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Vous savez ce qu’il vous reste à faire.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Déchaînez-moi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Je n’ai pas l’habitude d’attendre.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ma patience est à bout.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate1Used00=Que ma visée soit ajustée.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate1Used01=Il est temps d’équilibrer la marque !
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used00=Tu es à moi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used01=Entendez la reine banshee.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used02=Écoute et obéis.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used03=Que ton esprit est malléable.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used04=Sois à moi, serviteur.

VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed02=Je n’ai pas le temps de m’amuser… Bon d’accord, juste un match...
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed03=Et vous trouviez que les orcs avaient de grandes épaulières…
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed04=Je n’ai jamais goûté la mort… Sans bouche, ça ne risque pas de m’arriver.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed05=Il nous faut des renforts ! Exécuteur, déployez nos ravageurs !
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed06=Comment ça, nous n’avons plus de ravageurs ? Alors envoyez les Dragons !
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed07=Alors, que suggérez-vous ? C’est quoi, un Disloqueur ?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed08=Les jeux vidéo ont tellement évolué depuis le premier StarCraft… On ne peux quasiment plus distinguer les pixels, de nos jours.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed09=Une fois que vous avez goûté au côté obscur des templiers noirs, vous ne pouvez plus vous en passer.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed10=Maintenant que j’y repense, j’aurais peut-être dû purifier Mar Sara.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed11=En Taro… moi.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed12=Si vous voulez me parler, il n’y a Khala dire.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed13=Ne sous-estimez jamais la volonté d’un templier. Vous pourriez mal finir...
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed14=N’écoutez pas les mauvaises langues, les pouvoirs psi ne sont pas du tout « de la magie dans l’espace ». C’est COMPLÈTEMENT différent.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Resurrected00=Je revis.

VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec03=J’approuve.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec04=Un choix évident.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Taunt00=Les ennemis des Premiers-Nés tomberont.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Taunt01=Qui êtes-vous pour vous dresser contre moi ?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Taunt02=Tremblez devant la gloire du Khala.

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion01=La guerre est sur nous, j’espère que vous êtes prêts…
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Falstad00=Es-tu prêt à voir le Marteau du destin en action, nain ?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Garrosh…
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Hearthstone00=<Reuses Attack03 - For Doomhammer!>

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal01=Un soin parfaitement minuté.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal02=Mon esprit est ragaillardi.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana00=Je suis presque à cours de mana.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana01=Il me faut plus de mana.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana02=Mon mana est bas.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No00=Impossible.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No01=Non, mon ami.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No02=Ne me faites pas perdre mon temps.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Notre allié a besoin d’aide.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Aidez-moi, vite !
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Il me faut des renforts !
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Détruisez leur idole ! Lok’tar !
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Nous devrions enrôler ces mercenaires.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Guerriers, attaquez leur fort.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Défendons cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Défendons notre idole !
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Nous devons défendre notre fort, tout de suite.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Guerriers, défendez cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_KillHero00=Débarrassez-vous de ce héros !
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed00=Je suis le chef de guerre.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed01=Les esprits sont agités.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed02=Hein ? Quoi ? Ah oui… C’est là que je dois dire quelque chose de drôle. Désolé, ça fait tellement longtemps.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed03=<inhales> Ah, comme la stratégie en temps réel peut me manquer.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed04=La perspective isométrique, les grandes batailles épiques...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed05=Par contre, qu’on me clique dessus sans arrêt, ça ne me manquait pas…
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed06=Toi, enfant de la Terre, écoute moi.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed07=Vous vouliez un chef de guerre, mais pas pour le laisser en paix… évidemment.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed08=Quand on me pompe l’air, je suis colère, je deviens tout vert.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed09=Écoutez bien ce qu’en dit un chef de guerre... Il ne faut pas courir partout et faire n’importe quoi dès que quelqu’un hurle « pour la Horde ! »
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed10=Qu’est-ce qui était là en premier ? Le Marteau du destin ou les Marteau-du-Destin ? Réfléchissez bien.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed11=Alors, il m’ont donné quoi cette fois... Chaîne d’éclairs... ça marche à tous les coups. Esprit farouche... Furie-des-vents... Bon, désolé pour toi, Rehgar... C’est moi qui ai tous les bons sorts.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed12=Dans quelques extensions, Blizzard me remplacera par Garrosh ici aussi.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed13=Le coup qui a abattu Orgrim a laissé un accroc irréparable dans le dos de son plastron d’armure. Il est un rappel permanent du fait que l’ennemi peut frapper là où on l’attend le moins.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed14=Hein ? Vous voulez dire qu’il y a une « histoire » dans ce jeu ? Sérieusement, vous avez payé quelqu’un pour scénariser la rencontre entre Raynor et Diablo ? C’est pas précisément à ça que sert la fan fiction ? <soupir> Mais comment je me suis laissé entraîné là-dedans ?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Resurrected00=Merci.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Resurrected01=Je suis content de vous avoir avec moi.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive00=La Horde ne mourra jamais.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive01=Lok'tar ogar !
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive02=Que les ancêtres me bénissent.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec00=Ah. Bon choix.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec01=Hmm. Ça ira très bien.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec02=La puissance coule dans mes veines.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed13=Le coup qui a abattu Orgrim a laissé un accroc irréparable dans le dos de son plastron d’armure. Il est un rappel permanent du fait que l’ennemi peut frapper là où on l’attend le moins.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed14=Hein ? Vous voulez dire qu’il y a une « histoire » dans ce jeu ? Sérieusement, vous avez payé quelqu’un pour scénariser la rencontre entre Raynor et Diablo ?

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed02=Vous êtes dans la lune ou quoi ?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed03=Ça y est ? La lune de miel est déjà terminée ?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed04=Ça, c’est ma chouette. Y en a beaucoup comme ça, mais elle, elle démasque les ennemis.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed05=Je célèbre mon vingt-neuvième anniversaire la semaine prochaine… pour la dix-millième fois.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed06=Personne n’a vu mon tigre ? J’ai l’impression de ne pas l’avoir vu depuis des années. Minou, minou, par ici !
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed07=Quand les femmes géraient tout en Kalimdor, nous avons connu la paix… Maintenant que les hommes se sont réveillés, une nouvelle crise éclate tous les ans.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed08=<doorbell sound> Bonjour, je m’appelle Tyrande et voici sœur Shandris. Avez-vous un moment à nous consacrer pour parler d’Élune ? Tenez, prenez ce dépliant. <doors slam> Oh !  Les rustres...
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed09=Qu’est-ce que… Depuis combien de temps ai-je ces feuilles dans les cheveux ? Et pourquoi personne ne m’a rien dit ?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed10=Je m’appelle Tyrande, grande prêtresse de l’amour et de la justice, et au nom d’Élune, je te punirai !
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed11=Fut un temps où j’aurais décroché la lune pour toi. Mais cette époque est bien révolue…
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed12=J’aimerais bien avoir du temps pour m’occuper de moi. Un millénaire ou deux devraient suffire.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed13=Avec Malfurion, nous n’avons qu’une seule règle. Pas de changement de forme. Ce n’est pas mon truc…
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed14=Adieu la forêt, adieu les tortues, adieu les grottes et les glaives. Adieu Pennelune, adieu Élune.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Resurrected00=Il y a beaucoup à faire.

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec04=Ça devrait faire l’affaire.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt00=Priez pour que la déesse fasse preuve de pitié, car ce ne sera pas mon cas !
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt01=Tu vas regretter ton impudence.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt02=Si tu espérais me faire peur, c’est raté.

VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree02=Voilà ce que je veux entendre !
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroBoast00=La Lumière nous guidera vers la victoire.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroBoast01=Nous combattrons avec honneur !
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion00=Vous êtes prêt à leur botter le train ?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion01=Vous êtes prêts ?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=Toujours fier de servir aux côtés d’un autre soldat de l’Alliance.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Pourquoi devrais-je te faire confiance ?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=J’imagine que la fameuse « croisée » dont tout le monde parle tant c’est toi.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Greymane00=Genn Grisetête en personne. Il était temps que Gilnéas rejoigne le combat.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Oh. La Horde… La journée s’annonçait pourtant si belle.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Impressed00=Ho ho, l’expérience du champ de bataille semble t’avoir fait du bien.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Dame Jaina, quel plaisir de combattre de nouveau ensemble.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Le roi squelette, hein ? Tu aurais pu te creuser un peu la tête.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Light00=<Do not record. Reuses Pissed01>
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_LightVictory00=<Do not record. Reuses Boast00>
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Medic00=Ha ! Salutations, soldat !
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Qu’est-ce que tu veux exactement ?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Un nécromancien, hein ? Je ne peux pas dire que j’apprécie les personnes dans ton genre.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Negative00=<scoff> Alors c’est toi…
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Salutation, l’ami ! Alors, prêt à rendre la justice ?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Stitches00=Par la Lumière, quelle sorte d’abomination es-tu ?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Sylvanas ? Tu as une mine affreuse. On dirait une revenante.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Varian, la dernière fois que je t’ai vu, tu n’étais encore qu’un enfant !
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=C’est moi ou vous autres Zergs devenez de plus en plus bizarres ?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zuljin00=Alors c’est ça le puissant Zul’jin. Je m’attendais à plus impressionnant.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond00=Toujours prêt.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond01=Avec plaisir.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond02=Par la Lumière !
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Gloire à l’Alliance !
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Angry00=Tu viens de perdre un soin. Juste au moment où tu en aurais eu besoin. Quel dommage…
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Ferme ton clapet, ou je m’en charge moi-même.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Je me demande si je ne préférerais pas être sourd…
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Cranky00=À mon époque, on respectait ses aînés. SURTOUT lorsque c’est eux qui se chargeaient de vous soigner !
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Allons… Je maniais la Lumière alors que tu portais encore des couches.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Oui, on a compris, rien ne t’effraie. Félicitations. On peut continuer ?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Excited00=Hah ! Ça c'est un combat qui fera date.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Greymane00=Content de te l’entendre dire, vieux loup solitaire. Euh… désolé.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Horde00=Rajouter « nouvelle » devant Horde ne vous absout pas de vos pêchés, vous savez.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Impressed00=Très bien, voyons de quoi tu es capable.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Jaina00=La culpabilité me ronge, et je devrai vivre avec jusqu’à mon dernier souffle.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Pas étonnant que ton peuple t’ait tué.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Medic00=Qu… Quelle partie ? Les épaulières en forme d’aigle géant ? Ou mon marteau de premiers soins magiques ?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Toi, un héros ? Hah. La boue qui macule mes bottes est plus héroïque que toi.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Murky00=Tu veux bien répéter la question ?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=La Lumière ne doit pas souvent briller là d’où tu viens.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Negative00=Tais-toi un peu ! Nous avons un combat à gagner.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NewRace00=Tu viens d’Azeroth ? Pff, on quitte la planète pendant quelques années à peine et tout part à vau-l’eau.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NightElf00=Et moi qui trouvais les hauts-elfes imbus d’eux-même.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ha ! Montrons à ces pourris de quel bois on se chauffe.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Stitches00=Cela ne mérite même pas de réponse.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Et moi qui pensais que la mort rendait les gens MOINS agressifs.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Uncaring00=Oh, tu penses que j’en ai quelque chose à faire ? Ha. Elle est bien bonne.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Varian00=Pour l'Alliance !
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Tu as plutôt intérêt à ne pas oublier pour camp tu te bats, sale bestiole.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zuljin00=Oui. C’est tout à fait le genre de commentaire auquel on s’attend de la part d’un troll.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill00=Justice a été rendue.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill01=Allez dans la Lumière... maintenant !
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill02=C’est la fin pour vous.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill03=C’est fait.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill04=Tu ne fais aucun effort !
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAlliance00=Je te prie de me pardonner, mon ami.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAngel00=Hmm. Je crois que je viens de tuer un gardien des âmes !
VoiceOver/Uther/KillArthas00=Va brûler en enfer !
VoiceOver/Uther/KillChogall00=On dirait bien que les ogres-magi ne sont pas les égaux des paladins, finalement.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillCrusader00=Eh bien… tu n’es plus dans la « cour des grands », on dirait ?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDemon00=Retourne dans le Néant ! Ou bien d’où que tu viennes !
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDiablo00=Ce monde est enfin libéré de ta présence, démon !
VoiceOver/Uther/KillGuldan00=Même les « ténèbres incarnées » pâlissent devant la Lumière.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillHorde00=Nouvelle Horde peut-être, mais toujours aussi abominable.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillJaina00=<sigh> Comme c’est dommage…
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKaelthas00=Tu as encore beaucoup à apprendre, Kael’thas.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKerrigan00=Ce n’est que justice, Kerrigan !
VoiceOver/Uther/KillMedivh00=Que mon marteau finisse ce que la lame de Lothar a commencé.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillPaladin00=Que la Lumière aie pitié de mon âme.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillRaynor00=On dirait que tu as encore besoin d’entraînement, Raynor.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillScourge00=Tant que je vivrai, Lordaeron ne tombera pas entre les mains de ton maudit Fléau. 
VoiceOver/Uther/KillSpreeEnd00=Bien essayé.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillVarian00=C’est quoi, le texte ?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillWar200=Ahh, ça me rappelle des souvenirs.
VoiceOver/Uther/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal00=Content de vous savoir à mes côtés.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal01=Je vous dois la vie.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal02=Tu as ma gratitude éternelle, l’ami.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana00=Je n’ai plus beaucoup de mana.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana01=Mon mana est bas.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana02=Je commence à manquer de mana.
VoiceOver/Uther/No00=Non.
VoiceOver/Uther/No01=C’est impensable.
VoiceOver/Uther/No02=Impossible.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistHero00=Notre allié a besoin d’aide.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe00=Un coup de main serait le bienvenu.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe01=Une âme charitable pour m’aider ?
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackCastle00=Attaquez l’idole de l’ennemi.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackMerc00=Nous devrions capturer ce camp de mercenaires.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Attaquons ce fort !
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackTower00=Attaquons cette tour de guet !
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendCastle00=Défendons notre idole !

VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendTower00=Nous devrions défendre notre tour de guet.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_KillHero00=Nous devons abattre cet ennemi.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed00=Nous sommes bénis par la Lumière.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed01=La Lumière nous illumine tous.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed02=Je suis trop vieux pour ces bêtises.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed03=Parfois, la lumière au bout du tunnel n’est qu’un train.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed04=Aujourd’hui, vous pouvez m’appeler Uther le Cogneur de Lumière.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed05=C’est dans les nuits les plus obscures que les lumières que nous sommes brillent le plus.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed06=Sérieusement, l’ordre du triangle spatial étrange, ça ne sonne pas aussi bien.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed07=À mon époque, il n’y avait qu’un type de paladins, et nous étions bien contents de les avoir.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed08=Dire qu’on ne pouvait être que de niveau 10 maximum. Quel est votre niveau actuel, 100 ? Plus ? <soupir> Les jeunes de nos jours…
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed09=<sneeze> Que la Lumière exauce vos souhaits.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed10=Vous pourriez refaire la même chose, mais un peu plus à gauche cette fois ?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed11=Ahh, comme ça.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed12=Que le juste connaisse la paix, et le malin le dos de ma main.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed13=Mon église, c’est le champ de bataille. Pourquoi vous croyez que je transporte ce livre partout ? Pour m’amuser ?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed14=Au fait, un petit dragon de bronze m’a dit ce que vous autres elfes de sang prévoyiez pour mon tombeau… Je dois dire que ça ne m’enchante pas.
VoiceOver/Uther/Resurrected00=Heureux de vous avoir à mes côtés.
VoiceOver/Uther/Resurrected01=Merci de m’avoir sauvé.
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive00=Pour l'Alliance !
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive01=Justice a été rendue.
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive02=Bon, reprenons plus lentement…
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec00=Une décision pleine de sagesse.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec01=La foi est une récompense en soi.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec02=Cela peut m’être utile.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec03=Un choix excellent.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec04=Quoi qu'il en coûte !
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt00=Montrez-moi de quoi vous êtes capable.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt01=La lâcheté n’est pas une vertu.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt02=Du cran, que diantre !
VoiceOver/Uther/TeamKilled00=Je suis trop vieux pour tout ça.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_ExLocked00=Salutations, étranger.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_ExPurchased00=Bien le bonjour, l’ami.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Gift00=Un autre front ? Je suis prêt.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Lockin00=La Lumière n’abandonne jamais personne.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Purchase00=Pour Lordaeron !
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Trial00=Admirez un paladin en action.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Trial01=Ne mettez jamais la Lumière à l’épreuve.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitLocked00=Je suis le marteau de la justice.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitLocked01=Les paladins sont la clé de voûte de l’Alliance. Vous avez certainement besoin de mon expertise.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitPurchased00=Je ne suis plus si jeune, l’ami. On peut y aller ?
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitPurchased01=Il faut laisser le temps au temps, mais ma patience a des limites.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ultimate1Used00=N’ayez crainte ! La Lumière est à vos côtés !
VoiceOver/Uther/Ultimate1Used01=La Lumière est notre bouclier !

VoiceOver/WitchDoctorA/TripleKill02=En voilà une troisième.
VoiceOver/WitchDoctorMadAxe/MatchEnd00=C’est quoi, le texte ?
VoiceOver/WitchDoctorMadAxe/MatchEnd01=C’est quoi, le texte ?
VoiceOver/WitchDoctorMadAxe/MatchEnd02=C’est quoi, le texte ?
VoiceOver/WizardA/DoubleKill00=Ha ! Et de deux !
VoiceOver/WizardA/DoubleKill01=Coup double !
VoiceOver/WizardA/DoubleKill02=Deux pour le prix d’un.

VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Caution00=Attention, notre ennemi prépare quelque chose.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_GoodJob00=Impressionnant !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_GoodJob01=Je ne suis peut-être pas le seul prodige ici, après tout.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_GoodJob02=Tu atteins des sommets !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Heal00=Tu m’as tout l’air d’avoir besoin d’une fontaine de soins.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Heal01=Il y a des fontaines de soins ici. Va te soigner.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Retreat00=Retraite !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Retreat01=Repliez-vous !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Uhoh00=Oh non.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Uhoh01=Ce n’est pas ce qui était prévu.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Uhoh02=C’est d’un triste.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack00=Alors, ça fait quel effet ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack01=Tu as un pied dans la tombe !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack02=Tu oses ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack03=Tu ne t’attendais pas à ça, hein ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack04=Tu vas regretter ça, crois-moi.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack05=Est-ce que tu vaux vraiment la peine que je me fatigue ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack06=Je me demande pourquoi je m’embête avec toi.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Celebrate00=Je savais qu’on pouvait y arriver !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Celebrate01=Oui ! La victoire est proche !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Comeback00=Soyez forts, mes amis. Nous n’échouerons pas !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Healed00=Je n’ai plus mal.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Healed01=Je me sens mieux.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Healed02=Ça va mieux.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree00=Ça va être intéressant.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree01=Je vais en donner la preuve.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree02=Attendez de voir ce que je sais faire...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroBoast00=Ça va mal finir pour l’équipe d’en face.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroBoast01=J’ai passé beaucoup trop de temps à étudier pour me faire battre par cinq types sortis de nulle part.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion00=Prêts à décrocher la victoire ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion01=J’espère que vous êtes prêts pour cette bataille.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Alors Asmodan, on vient essuyer une autre défaite humiliante ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Voilà un visage que j’aurais préféré ne jamais revoir.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Les ennemis qui nous attendent sont peut-être les plus puissants que nous ayons jamais affronté ensemble.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Deckard00=Cain ! Je vous retrouve une fois encore.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Nous deux, dans le même camp ? Ça n’a aucun sens.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_LordofHell00=Il me restera bien assez d’énergie pour t’affronter quand nous en aurons fini.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_MagicUser00=Je n’aurais jamais pensé que quelqu’un utilisait encore ces vieux sorts !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=L’ange de la Mort ? Ici ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Quel genre de monstre es-tu ? Est-ce que tu as des affixes ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Un nécromancien... Est-ce que tu connais Mehtan ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Je dois me battre à tes côtés ? C’est pas vrai...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Cette bataille promet d’être amusante !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_SpaceLordLeoric00=Ta puissance maléfique ne triomphera pas, seigneur de l’espace !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Je suis si heureuse que tu m’accompagnes, Tyraël.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond00=Naturellement !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond01=Ce ne sera pas un problème.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond02=J’ai tellement hâte !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=On pourrait quitter cette bataille et s’affronter en duel, tu sais.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Je ne peux donc aller nulle part sans subir tes railleries ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Hmm. Bon, d’accord.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Tu as toujours été si éloquent.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Quoi qu’il en soit, ils ne sont pas plus malins pour autant.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Comment ai-je fait pour savoir que vous alliez dire ça ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Est-ce qu’on est obligés de faire ça ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=Tu as dû ouvrir un dictionnaire pour chercher tous ces mots ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Mieux que mon alliance avec toi, en tout cas.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_LordofHell00=Inquiète-toi plutôt de ton cas.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_MagicUser00=Regarde-moi bien, et tu apprendras peut-être deux-trois choses au passage.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=J’espère que quelqu’un finira par t’arracher les ailes.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Si tu n’as rien d’intelligent à dire, contente-toi de te taire.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Je suis une sorcière, en vérité. Et pour tout dire, c’est toi qui m’as l’air déséquilibré.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Ne réfléchis pas trop, tu pourrais te fouler les neurones.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Je suis tellement soulagée de ne pas avoir à tout faire moi-même !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Oh, ça va être merveilleux, je le sens.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_SpaceLordLeoric00=Au nom des étoiles, je vais te punir !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Je n’aurais pas pu rêver mieux.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=Hum. J’aurais peut-être dû poursuivre mes études, en fin de compte...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill00=Plus rien ne m’arrête !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill01=Mais comment je fais pour être si forte ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill02=Je vais leur montrer à tous !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill03=Tu peux toujours essayer de te défendre !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill04=Et c’est juste l’échauffement !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillAngel00=Ne jamais sous-estimer un Nephalem.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillButcher00=Et maintenant, c’est qui la viande fraîche ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDeckard00=Dans quelle galère vous êtes-vous encore fourré, Cain ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDemon00=Tu ne me laisseras donc jamais tranquille ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiablo00=Ça, c’était pour Léah !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiabloHero00=Hmm... Rappelle-moi, tu étais quelqu’un d’important ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillJaina00=Mieux vaut être sorcière que mage.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillKaelthas00=Les mages elfes ne font pas le poids contre moi...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillLeoric00=Combien de fois faudra-t-il que je te tue ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMalthael00=C’est beaucoup plus rapide de te tuer, la deuxième fois.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMedivh00=Ce duel de magie est terminé. Tu as perdu.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillNephalem00=Je ne voulais vraiment pas en arriver là... Promis !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillSpreeEnd00=C’était amusant.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillTyrael00=Pardon, mon ami...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillWeird00=C’est fini pour toi... Mais comment as-tu pu seulement exister ? Beurk.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh00=<petit rire>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh01=<petit rire>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh02=<rire modéré>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh03=<rire modéré>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh04=<grand rire>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal00=Merci pour cette attention, soigneur.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal01=Je dois avoir un nouvel ange gardien.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal02=Décidément, tu arrives au bon moment !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana00=J’ai besoin de mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana01=Je n’ai pas assez de mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana02=Plus assez de mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No00=Mais quelle drôle d’idée !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No01=Jamais de la vie.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No02=Je refuse de faire ça.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Notre allié aurait besoin d’un coup de main.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Je pourrais avoir un petit coup de main ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe01=J’ai... besoin d’un peu d’aide.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=C’est le moment d’attaquer leur idole !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Je devrais m’emparer de ce camp de mercenaires.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Attaquons ce fort !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackTower00=On devrait prendre cette tour de guet !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Notre idole ne doit pas tomber ! Nous allons perdre !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Ce fort a besoin d’aide. Maintenant !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendTower00=On ferait mieux de protéger cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_KillHero00=Nous devons abattre ce héros.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed00=J’accomplirai ma destinée.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed01=La magie a toujours coulé de source pour moi.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed02=Oui, c’est moi qui ai détruit le sanctuaire des Ysharis. Je n’avais pas le choix.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed03=Youhou, il y a quelqu’un ? Non, personne ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed04=J’ai étudié les secrets de la magie antique, et je dois dire que c’était barbant. Mais vous, vous arrivez quand même à m’agacer. Comment vous faites ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed05=Je crois que c’est le moment idéal pour m’entraîner à lancer ce sort de silence.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed06=Qu’est-ce que vous dites de ça ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed07=(Bruits étouffés et confus, tandis que la sorcière se rend compte qu’elle est victime de son propre sort de silence.)
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed08=Hum. Heu... Ça ne m’était jamais arrivé avant.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed09=Un mot de ceci à qui que ce soit, et je vous envoie dans un autre plan de l’existence.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed10=Mes professeurs disaient toujours que j’étais une élève à problèmes… jusqu’à ce que je leur lance un sort de silence.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed11=C’est amusant qu’Eirena utilise des catalyseurs pour concentrer ses sorts. Vu qu’elle est encore, vous savez... Hum. Disons qu’elle est « distraite ».
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed12=Un jour, j’ai envoyé un projectile magique dans les ténèbres... Le moins qu’on puisse dire, c’est que ça en a contrarié certains.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed13=C’est pas moi qui ai cassé la pendule !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed14=Isendra était un excellent professeur, mais elle a toujours tenu à garder un ou deux secrets pour elle. Je me demande encore comment elle pouvait se téléporter aussi vite... et sans temps de recharge !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed15=La magie, c’est pas sorcier !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected00=Tu es mon guérisseur préféré, maintenant !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected01=C’est encore mieux que les prêtres de Zakarum !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive00=On dirait que ma mort n’est pas pour aujourd’hui.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive01=Oh, ce n’est pas ce que j’avais prévu...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive02=Je devrais faire plus attention. Ou pas.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec00=Toujours plus de puissance !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec01=Quel succès !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec02=Ah, si les maîtres me voyaient…
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec03=Mon savoir s’étend.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec04=Je suis encore plus puissante qu’avant.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt00=C’est le moment de faire tes prières.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt01=La mort ne te fait pas peur ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt02=Un adversaire à ma mesure !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/TeamKilled00=Cette bataille est difficile, mais on ne doit pas perdre espoir.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_ExLocked00=Besoin d’une sorcière ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Je suis là pour aider.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Gift00=J’irai là où le besoin s’en fait sentir.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Lockin00=Ce royaume a besoin de moi.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Purchase00=Je savais que je vous aimais bien.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial00=Vous voulez vraiment une démonstration ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial01=On ne joue pas avec la magie. Mais pour une fois...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Vous n’avez qu’un mot à dire.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Je ne fais pas que causer des problèmes, je sais aussi les résoudre.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Quand vous voudrez.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Alors, on se bouge, un peu ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used00=Je suis bien trop forte pour vous.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used01=C’est la fin !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used02=Tremblez devant la puissance des arcanes !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used03=<rire>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate2Used00=Arrière !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate2Used01=C’en est assez !
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Cheer00=<acclamation>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Cheer01=<acclamation>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled00=<exclamation de surprise>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled01=<exclamation de surprise>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled02=<exclamation de surprise>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled03=<exclamation de surprise>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled04=<exclamation de surprise>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineFive00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineFour00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineOne00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineThree00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineTwo00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/WorthIt00=Haha, je t’ai eu ! Et tant pis pour le reste.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/WorthIt01=J’ai vu pire, comme résultat.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes00=Hmph, d’accord.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes01=Ça marche.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes02=C’est parti.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes03=Où va-t-on ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes04=On dirait bien que mon voyage n'est pas terminé.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes05=Est-ce que je suis censée être là ?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes06=Caldeum me manque vraiment.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes07=Si c’était si facile, tout le monde le ferait.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes08=Mes sorts sont prêts.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes09=Pourquoi pas ?
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack00=À l’attaque ! L’ennemi est affaibli !
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack01=L’ennemi dévoile son point faible. Frappez maintenant !
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack02=Oui, je vois. Le temps est venu de frapper !
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Caution00=Prenez garde, nos ennemis mijotent quelque chose.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob00=Très beau travail.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob01=Personne ne peut nous arrêter.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob02=Bon travail.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Heal00=Va te soigner. Maintenant.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Heal01=Va à une fontaine de soins tant que tu le peux encore.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Retreat00=Je dois reculer.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Retreat01=Je vais battre en retraite, provisoirement.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh00=Un coup malhabile.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh01=<Sharp angry growl.>
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh02=Une fâcheuse évolution.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack00=Nous dévorons.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack01=Ma proie approche.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack02=Sens la fureur de l’Essaim !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack03=Je suis ta perte !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack04=<angry growl>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack05=L’Essaim va t’écraser !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack06=Et maintenant tu vas payer !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Celebrate00=Pour l’Essaim !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Celebrate01=Nous sommes triomphants !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Comeback00=Nous rattrapons nos ennemis ! Ne vous relâchez pas.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death00=<râle de mort>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death01=<râle de mort>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death02=<râle de mort>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death03=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death04=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death05=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death06=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death07=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed00=Beau travail, serviteur.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed01=Mes blessures ont été soignées.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed02=Je me remets.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree00=<chuckle> Bien.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree01=Tous ceux qui nous feront face mourront.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree02=L’Essaim envahira tout l’univers !
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroBoast00=Nous allons arracher chacun de leurs membres !
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroBoast01=Nos ennemis vont connaître la fureur de l’Essaim !
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion00=Prêts, serviteurs ?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion01=Vous êtes prêts à les tailler en pièces ?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Abathur00=Ne me déçois pas, maître des évolutions.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Anubarak00=Tu sais, t’ajouter à mon Essaim le rendrait plus puissant.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=Ma reine...
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Quelle étrange créature tu es.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Hummm... Toi.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Enfin un renfort utile !
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Sonya00=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroQuestion00>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Sonya01=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroQuestion00>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_SonyaDK00=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroQuestion00>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_SonyaDK01=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroQuestion01>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond00=L’Essaim est prêt.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond01=Quelle question stupide.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond02=Nous allons évoluer, et nous allons vaincre.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Abathur00=Notre heure est venue, Abathur ! Pour l’Essaim !
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Anubarak00=Bête à manger du mucus…
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Sans aucun doute.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Murky00=Qu’est-ce que tu viens de dire ?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Negative00=Silence. Nous avons une bataille à gagner.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Positive00=Allons montrer à ces imbéciles la fureur de l’Essaim !
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Sonya00=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroRespond00>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Sonya01=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroRespond01>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Sonya02=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroRespond02>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_SonyaDK00=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroRespond00>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_SonyaDK01=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroRespond01>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_SonyaDK02=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroRespond02>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill00=Succombe face à l’Essaim !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill01=Piètre créature.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill02=Flasque et faible.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill03=Tu n’avais aucun espoir.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill04=Je suis triomphante.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillAbathur00=Ta place est dans la fosse d’évolution, pas sur le champ de bataille.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillDemon00=Humm, quelle puissante essence. Abathur devrait l’examiner.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillKerrigan00=Désormais, je suis le cœur de l’Essaim !
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillProtoss00=Que j’aime entendre craquer les os des Protoss.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillSpreeEnd00=Ton temps est révolu !
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillTerran00=Terran inutile.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillZagara00=Je suis la première des mères des couvées !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Laugh01=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal00=Je vais à nouveau bien ! Merci.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal01=Tu m’as sauvée...
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal02=Juste à temps, serviteur.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana00=Je risque de manquer de mana.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana01=Je n’ai plus beaucoup de mana.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana02=Il me faut plus de mana.
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd00=C’est quoi, le texte ?
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd01=C’est quoi, le texte ?
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd02=C’est quoi, le texte ?
VoiceOver/Zagara/No00=Il m’est impossible d’obéir.
VoiceOver/Zagara/No01=Impossible.
VoiceOver/Zagara/No02=Non, je ne peux pas.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistHero00=Aidez notre allié !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistMe00=Ma couvée est attaquée !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistMe01=L’ennemi s’oppose à moi !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackCastle00=Allons détruire l’idole ennemie !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackMerc00=Je suggère la capture de ce camp de mercenaires.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Allons détruire ce fort !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackTower00=Nous devrions nous assurer de cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendCastle00=Défendons notre idole.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Nous devrions défendre ce fort.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendTower00=Nous devrions défendre cette tour de guet.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_KillHero00=Cet ennemi doit mourir.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed00=Ma progéniture est prête.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed01=L’Essaim est affamé.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed02=Vous ne deviez pas créer plus de dominants ?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed03=Je suis une reine mortelle.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed04=Mon Zerg, ma bataille.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed05=Ce n’est pas une tumeur ! Euh, une minute, c’est une tumeur muqueuse en fait, au temps pour moi.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed06=Que Dieu sauve la reine ! Les autres peuvent mourir…
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed07=Être mère célibataire d’une couvée de 4 millions et demi de Zergs, ça me file le cafard.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed08=J'en ai assez de tenir la chandelle !
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed09=Quand je serai enfin reine des Lames, je n’aurai plus à supporter ces sarcasmes.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed10=Seulement quatre ans et déjà mère... des couvées. Que le temps passe vite.
