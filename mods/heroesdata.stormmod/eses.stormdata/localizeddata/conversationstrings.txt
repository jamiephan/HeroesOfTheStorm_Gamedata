Conversation/CreepVO/Line00247=¿Qué tenemos aquí? No dejan de llegar granujas a la Bahía de Almanegra, ¿eh?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00248=Bien, marineros de agua dulce, todos deben presentar sus respetos al capitán. Y este capitán solo respeta una cosa: ¡el oro! ¡Jaja!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00249=No me importa cómo lo consigáis, bribones.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00250=Robando...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00251=Matando... ¡lo que sea!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00252=¡Vosotros venid a verme al barco y dadme los doblones! A cambio, saludaré a vuestros enemigos a cañonazos, ¡ja, ja, ja!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00254=Este reino está bajo mi protección. Responde a cada uno de mis caprichos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00255=Si deseáis la victoria, tendréis que reunir tributo en mi nombre.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00256=Los primeros en lograrlo recibirán mi bendición.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00257=Vuestros enemigos caerán... Sus defensas serán desactivadas y debilitadas.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00258=Será mejor que aprovechéis la ventaja. Mi favor no durará eternamente. Ja, ja, ja.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00259=¿Y bien? ¿Estáis listos para empezar?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00260=¿Osáis entrar en la Cuenca Maldita? Interesante.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00261=Las minas se abrirán en nada... Pronto los no-muertos despertarán.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00262=La muerte acecha en las minas... ¿Os enfrentaréis a la oscuridad?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00263=¿Estáis preparados para los no-muertos? Pronto se abrirán las minas.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00264=Los muertos vuelven a alzarse, héroes. ¿Osaréis entrar a las minas?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00265=Ya no hay vuelta atrás...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00266=Entrad, héroes. Los condenados os esperan.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00267=¿Oís ese estrépito? Creo que tienen hambre...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00268=¡Alzaos, gólems! ¡Alzaos y desatad vuestra ira!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00269=¡Que se alcen mis gólems!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00270=Esta es la hora en que regresan mis gólems.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00271=¡Bien hecho! Vuestro gólem es más fuerte que el de vuestros enemigos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00272=Vuestro gólem está listo. Pero es más débil que el de vuestros enemigos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00273=Parece que ambos gólems tienen una fuerza similar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00274=Los gólems vuelven... Y el vuestro es mucho más fuerte.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00275=¡Bien hecho! Vuestro gólem es mucho más fuerte que el del enemigo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00276=Los gólems se alzan, pero advertid que el vuestro es mucho más débil.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00277=Si queréis un gólem más fuerte, tendréis que reunir más calaveras.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00278=Los gólems han resucitado. Tienen una fuerza similar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00279=Mmm. Parece que el poder de ambos gólems es similar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00280=Mis gólems regresan... Esto va a ser entretenido.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00281=¡Desatad vuestra furia irrefrenable!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00282=Cuidado... ¡Os podéis llevar un susto de muerte!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00283=<Risa siniestra>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00284=Bien, la atracción principal está a punto de comenzar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00285=Bueno, va a ser un espectáculo muy macabro.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00286=Bienvenidos, héroes insensatos, a las Minas Encantadas. Aquí reina la muerte...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00287=Pronto las minas se abrirán... Y los horrores de su interior despertarán.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00288=A lo mejor podemos llegar a un acuerdo mutuamente beneficioso.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00289=Matad a los no-muertos y arrancadles las calaveras.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00290=A cambio, invocaré a mis poderosos gólems de hueso.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00291=Destruirán las defensas de vuestros enemigos. ¿Trato hecho?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00292=Los santuarios despiertan. ¡Controladlos y liberad al caballero dragón!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00293=Los santuarios concentran poder. El caballero dragón llama desde la piedra.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00294=Héroes, pronto despertarán los santuarios...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00295=El poder se concentra en los santuarios. ¡Desatad la cólera del dragón!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00296=Rápido, activad los santuarios y el poder del dragón será vuestro.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00297=El dragón no descansará más... ¡Desatad su poder!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00298=Activad los santuarios. ¡Tomad el poder del caballero dragón!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00299=¡Liberad al caballero dragón y masacrad a vuestros enemigos!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00300=¡Ahora! ¡Liberad al caballero dragón!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00301=¡El poder del dragón es vuestro, héroes!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00302=¡Destrozad a vuestros enemigos!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00303=Héroes, vuestro enemigo controla los santuarios...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00304=Ahora os enfrentaréis a la cólera del dragón.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00305=Se os agota el tiempo, héroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00306=¡Vuestros enemigos arderán!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00307=¡Reduciré a vuestros enemigos a cenizas!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00308=¡Regreso a la vida!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00309=Arderéis.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00310=Las llamas lo purifican todo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00311=Os reduciré a cenizas.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00312=¡No volveré a esa prisión! ¡No!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00313=No... ¡No he acabado!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00314=¡Los dragones volverán a gobernar!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00315=¡Los dragones reclaman este reino!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00316=Los jardines del Condado del Dragón... Son radiantes, ¿verdad? Y aun así están construidos sobre una mentira...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00317=El pueblo ha olvidado mi linaje, que este reino lo gobernaban los dragones.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00318=Activad el santuario del sol y el de la luna, y la magia que aprisiona a mi caballero dragón se debilitará.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00319=Os cederé su poder. Quemad a vuestros enemigos y arrasad sus fortificaciones. Recordadle a este mundo su verdadera herencia.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00320=El dragón renacerá. Controlad su poder, o sucumbid ante él... La elección es vuestra.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00321=Vuestro gólem es más débil que el de vuestro enemigo. Preparad las defensas.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00322=Los gólems tienen una fuerza similar. Preparaos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00323=La invocación ha concluido. Vuestro gólem es más fuerte que el del enemigo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00324=Vuestro gólem es más fuerte que el del enemigo. Aprovechadlo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00325=Un gólem débil. Recoged más calaveras, héroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00326=Listo. Vuestro gólem es igual al de vuestros enemigos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00327=¡Libérate y destruye a tus enemigos!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00328=Matad a los no-muertos y tomad sus calaveras.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00329=¡Recoged calaveras y potenciad vuestro gólem!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00330=Los malditos volverán pronto. Preparaos, héroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00331=Escuchad, héroes... Los no-muertos se levantarán pronto en las minas.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00332=¡Levantaos, gólems míos, y desatad vuestra cólera infinita!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00333=Los santuarios vuelven a despertar. ¿Quién controlará el poder del caballero dragón?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00334=¡Héroes, el dragón espera! Liberadlo y destruid a vuestro enemigo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00335=¡Es el momento! ¡Desatad el poder del dragón!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00336=El fin se acerca. Vuestro enemigo despertará al dragón.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00337=¡Vuestro enemigo caerá!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00338=¡El fuego viene a por vosotros!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00339=El tiempo... vuela...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00340=¡Héroes, la noche caerá dentro de poco! Espero que estéis preparados.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00341=Cae la noche, héroes. Adoro ver mi jardín a la luz de la luna.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00342=La noche cae una vez más, y pronto los espantajos despertarán.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00343=Llega la noche, héroes. Recordad: matad a los espantajos y reclamad sus semillas.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00344=Anochecerá en 30 segundos. ¿Estáis listos para un poco de diversión?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00345=¡Los espantajos despiertan! Matadlos... Reclamad sus semillas.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00346=Los espantajos despiertan... Matadlos y reunid las semillas.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00347=Es la hora... Haced lo que debe hacerse.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00348=Los espantajos vuelven a despertar. Liberad mis semillas, héroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00349=Matadlos a todos. ¡Recuperad mis semillas!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00350=La luz del alba... Aprisa, héroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00351=Amanece... Se nos acaba el tiempo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00352=La luz. El día se acerca.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00353=El sol mezquino... Ahora, reclamad mis semillas...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00358=Tenéis semillas suficientes. Traédmelas y mejoraré vuestras carnes endebles.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00359=Por fin, tenéis semillas suficientes... Venid... Convertíos en el orgullo de mi jardín.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00360=Traed esas semillas a mi tierra... y alimentaos del terror de vuestros enemigos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00361=Plantad las semillas, héroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00362=Venid a plantar las semillas. Ya.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00363=Me impaciento. Plantad las semillas... tomad mi poder.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00364=Venid a la tierra fértil... plantad las semillas.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00365=Plantad las semillas, criaturas de carne.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00366=¡Vuestro terror vive! ¡Adelante! ¡Cosechad los cadáveres de vuestros enemigos!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00367=Excelente. Avanzad. ¡Arrancad de raíz los fuertes del enemigo!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00368=¡Levántate, terror! ¡Absorbe la vida de tus enemigos!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00369=Vuestro enemigo engendra un terror.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00370=El terror de vuestro enemigo brota.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00371=Los enemigos cultivan un terror.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00372=Vuestro terror vive.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00373=Al fin, vuestro terror vive.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00374=Vuestro terror brota. Que sea más fuerte que el de vuestros enemigos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00375=Vuestro enemigo ha engendrado un terror.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00376=¡Parece que vuestros enemigos también tienen su propio terror!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00377=¡Héroes, vuestro enemigo ha engendrado un terror!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00378=¡No! Mi precioso terror ha caído.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00379=Vuestro terror ha caído. Volvéis a ser solo carne y huesos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00380=Vuestro terror, mi vástago, ha caído.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00381=El terror de vuestro enemigo ya es abono.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00382=Habéis destruido el terror de vuestros enemigos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00383=El terror de los enemigos es solo corteza.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00384=Vuestro terror ha caído, pero el de vuestro enemigo vive.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00385=¡Héroes, el terror de vuestros enemigos está vivo!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00386=Ahora estáis solos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00387=Nadie puede deteneros. ¡Destruidlos!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00388=Sí... Guiad a mi terror. Matadlos a todos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00389=Su terror cae... Cosechad sus cadáveres.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00394=¡Habéis recogido suficientes semillas! Plantadlas y sus vástagos mejorarán vuestra débil carne...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00395=Por fin, tenéis semillas suficientes. Plantadlas aquí, convertíos en el orgullo de mi jardín.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00396=Bien hecho, héroes. Traed aquí esas semillas y os alimentaréis del terror de vuestros enemigos.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00397=¡Ha brotado un terror!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00398=Un terror vive.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00399=¡Ha brotado un terror!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00400=Un terror vive.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00401=El sol asoma... Mis pequeñas deben dormir, por ahora.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00402=Veo que habéis sobrevivido a otra noche. Qué buena noticia.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00403=Héroes, el alba ha llegado y, con ella, mis pequeñas deben descansar.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00404=Por ahora ha acabado... Pero no os relajéis. Los terrores volverán.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00405=Ah, héroes. Habéis llegado justo a tiempo para ver cómo mi jardín florece.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00406=Por la noche, nos transformamos. El Jardín del Terror florece.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00407=Matad a los espantajos y tomad sus semillas.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00408=Cuando tengáis bastantes, os otorgaré el poder de la naturaleza.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00004=Salve, héroe... Soy Uther el Iluminado. Has sido escogido por el Nexo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00005=¿El Nexo? ¿Entonces esto es una movida protoss?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00006=¿Qué? No, es... Mira...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00007=El Nexo es una tormenta cósmica en la que los mundos chocan a nivel temporal, espacial y hasta dimensional.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00008=Has sido invocado aquí para ser puesto a prueba en la forja del combate y para alcanzar la gloria.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00009=La gloria, ¿eh? Ya me habías convencido con el "salve".
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00010=La puerta de la tormenta nos llevará a la Corte del Cuervo, un reino del Nexo. Haz clic derecho para ir allí.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00013=Eh, este no es mi primer rodeo, Uther. Ya sé andar...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00014=No lo dudo, amigo, pero aquí las cosas son distintas. ¡Es mejor aprenderlo bien ahora!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00015=¿Un esbirro enemigo tan pronto? Acabamos de llegar... Bah, pulsa la tecla "A" y luego haz clic izquierdo para atacar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00016=¿Un esbirro enemigo tan pronto? Acabamos de llegar... Bah, pulsa la tecla "A" y luego haz clic derecho para atacar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00017=¿Un esbirro enemigo, ya? Acabamos de llegar... Bah, pulsa la tecla Atacar y haz clic para acabar con él.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00019=¿Piensas echar una mano, Uther?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00020=Ya he completado mi tutorial, muchacho. Tendrás que buscarte la vida. Además, creo que podrás con unos pocos esbirros.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00021=¿Acabo de ver una esfera brillante salir de esa cosa?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00022=Una esfera de regeneración. Desplázate hacia ella y os regenerará salud y maná a ti y a los aliados cercanos.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00023=¡Siento cómo recupero la salud!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00024=Eso era una esfera de regeneración. Regenera salud y maná para ti y para los aliados cercanos.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00028=Bien hecho. Parece que hemos llegado a la ciudad.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00029=Echa el freno, amigo. Antes de ir a ninguna parte, quiero saber adónde voy... ¿Qué es ese "Nexo" exactamente?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00030=El Nexo es una tormenta cósmica en la que los mundos chocan a nivel temporal, espacial y hasta dimensional.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00031=Cada vez llaman a más de los nuestros a este reino enigmático, para probarnos en la forja del combate contra otros de méritos similares.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00032=Entonces, estoy aquí para matar cosas.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00033=Y alcanzar la gloria.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00034=Perfecto. Sin complicaciones. Vamos.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00035=¿Diablo?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00036=¿Osas plantarle cara al Señor del Terror?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00037=¿A qué sabe tu miedo, mortal?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00038=Ni idea. Te lo diría, pero es que nunca tengo, ¿sabes?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00039=¡Te devoraré!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00040=Vaya, no le preocupa dar una buena primera impresión... Será mejor que le enseñe modales.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00041=¿Te importaría decirme qué está pasando aquí?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00042=Este reino se conoce como la Corte del Cuervo… y parece que está siendo asediado por el señor demoníaco Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00043=Las habilidades están en la barra de la parte inferior de la pantalla.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00044=Para enfrentarte a Diablo tendrás que exprimir tus habilidades.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00045=Primero, prueba el Proyectil penetrante contra los soldados no-muertos de Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00046=Primero, probemos tu Proyectil penetrante contra los esbirros de Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00047=Ten paciencia. Apunta con cuidado y vuelve a intentarlo.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00049=Pulsa la tecla Q y apunta tu flecha hacia los esqueletos. Cuando estés listo, haz clic derecho para disparar.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00051=Hacer clic derecho cancela una habilidad. Cuando la flecha se active, haz clic izquierdo para disparar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00052=Hacer clic izquierdo cancela una habilidad. Cuando la flecha se active, haz clic derecho para disparar.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00055=Activa Proyectil penetrante y apunta tu flecha hacia los enemigos. Cuando estés listo, haz clic para disparar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00056=Una vez que hayas pulsado la tecla Q, apunta tu flecha hacia los enemigos y haz clic izquierdo para disparar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00057=Una vez que hayas pulsado la tecla Q, apunta tu flecha hacia los enemigos y haz clic derecho para disparar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00058=Una vez que hayas activado Proyectil penetrante, apunta tu flecha hacia los enemigos y haz clic para disparar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00059=Pulsa la tecla Q, apunta tu flecha hacia los enemigos y haz clic izquierdo para disparar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00060=Pulsa la tecla Q, apunta tu flecha hacia los enemigos y haz clic derecho para disparar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00061=Activa Proyectil penetrante, apunta tu flecha hacia los enemigos y haz clic para disparar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00062=¡Eso es! Si usas tus habilidades, infligirás más daño que con tus ataques normales.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00063=Ahí delante hay más esqueletos. Usa tu Proyectil Penetrante para acabar con ellos.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00064=Hay más esbirros delante. Utiliza tu Proyectil penetrante para derrotarlos.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00065=¡Buen disparo!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00066=Te recomiendo que lo pruebes alguna vez, Uther. Es mucho más efectivo que golpear cosas con ese maldito martillo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00067=Recuerda: puedes utilizar Proyectil penetrante para matar a varios esbirros a la vez.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00068=Hay demasiados esqueletos... Tenemos que retirarnos.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00069=Esto no es bueno. Los chicos están perdiendo las ganas de luchar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00070=Tu habilidad Inspirar os anima a tus aliados y a ti.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00071=¡Debes inspirar a estos lacayos y continuar la lucha!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00072=¡Siento que puedo dominar el mundo! ¡Cargad!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00073=No te pongas gallito, chaval...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00074=Tu habilidad Inspirar aumenta tu velocidad de ataque y la de tus aliados cercanos. Úsala siempre que puedas.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00075=Tu habilidad Inspirar os anima a tus aliados cercanos y a ti. Úsala siempre que puedas.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00076=Recuerda: tu proyectil penetrante puede matar a grupos de esqueletos mientras tus esbirros luchan.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00077=Inspirar a tus esbirros te ayudará a derrotar a los esqueletos con mayor eficacia.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00078=Vuestro renovado coraje no os salvará. Este es vuestro fin.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00079=Nuestros lacayos se enfrentan a Diablo ahí delante. Desbloquea la cámara y echa un vistazo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00080=Eso es. Ahora desplaza el mapa y veamos qué trama Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00081=¡Arded en el infierno!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00082=¡Está herido! ¡Es el momento de atacar!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00083=Pulsa la barra espaciadora para que la cámara vuelva a tu héroe.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00084=¡Haz que la cámara vuelva a enfocar a tu héroe y sigamos adelante!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00085=Si quieres, puedes volver a bloquear la cámara pulsando la tecla "L".
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00086=Si quieres, puedes volver a bloquear la cámara.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00087=¡Este reino y todas sus almas impuras me pertenecen!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00088=No en mi turno.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00089=Diablo juega duro. Utiliza Proyectil penetrante para repelerlo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00090=Perseguiré tu alma hasta el fin de los tiempos, James Raynor.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00091=¡Bien hecho, muchacho! Pero esto aún no ha terminado.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00092=Usa la piedra de hogar para alcanzarme.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00093=No te muevas mientras la magia de la piedra de hogar hace su trabajo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00094=Esto sí que mola...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00095=Esto es la Cámara de las Tormentas. Aquí se invocan los héroes al comenzar una batalla.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00096=Nuestro objetivo es destruir el núcleo del enemigo y proteger el nuestro de sus ataques.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00097=Los núcleos invocan esbirros que se desplazan por el terreno y luchan entre sí oleada tras oleada.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00098=Vale. Si me cargo el núcleo de Diablo, fin de la batalla... Coser y cantar. Pero, dime, ¿por qué hacemos todo esto?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00099=¿Sabes? No deberías pensar mucho en estas cosas...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00100=Primero, dirígete al frente.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00101=¡Puntos querer jugar!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00102=Eso no ha sido muy inteligente... Atacar un fuerte sin ayuda es prácticamente un suicidio.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00103=Nuestros esbirros te ayudarán a avanzar hasta el núcleo del enemigo. Quédate detrás de ellos y déjalos que absorban daño.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00104=¡Cuidado! Ataca las torres solo cuando estén centradas en disparar a otros.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00105=¡Bien hecho! Has demostrado tu valía.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00106=¿Qué puedo decir? Se me da bien hacer que exploten las cosas.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00107=¡Los esbirros y la piedra no son ningún desafío! ¡Ahora me alimentaré de tu terror!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00108=¿"Alimentarte de mi terror"? Pues te vas a quedar con hambre… Como no intentes alimentarte de la lección que te voy a dar...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00109=¡Mmmm! Chico tener razón. Terror no saciar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00110=¿Lo ves? El gordito lo entiende.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00111=¡Ya es suficiente!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00112=Un momento. ¿No acabo de morir?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00113=No te preocupes. En el Nexo, la muerte es solo un contratiempo. Tras una breve pausa revivirás listo para la pelea.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00114=Espero que no te moleste si esta vez me uno. Eso debería equilibrar la balanza.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00115=Para nada... ¡Vamos, colega!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00116=Monta y volvamos a la batalla.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00117=Si montas, podremos llegar más rápido al frente.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00118=Puedes desmontar pulsando otra vez el botón de montar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00119=Ten cuidado. No siempre estaré ahí para salvarte.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00120=Cuidado, muchacho. Te he vuelto a salvar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00121=Recoge esferas para regenerar salud y maná.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00122=Las torres enemigas son mortíferas, pero atacarán antes a los esbirros que a un héroe.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00123=Asalta las torres cuando nuestros esbirros estén cerca.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00124=¡Rápido! ¡Escapemos hasta que haya esbirros para protegernos!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00125=Permanece detrás de nuestros esbirros y deja que absorban daño.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00126=No olvides utilizar Proyectil penetrante e Inspirar para librarte más fácilmente de los enemigos.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00127=Si se te olvida un comando, puedes encontrarlo aquí, arriba a la izquierda.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00128=¡Eso es! ¡Solo queda el núcleo del enemigo!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00129=Eh, ¿tienes algo más que decir, demoniete?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00130=Me vengaré, James Raynor. ¡Esto no ha acabado!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00131=¡Esta lucha no es justa!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00132=¡No lucharás solo!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00133=Vaya, mira qué ha arrastrado el Nexo hasta aquí. Me alegro de verte, vaquero.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00134=¿Nova? Empiezo a sentirme como en casa por aquí.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00135=No te pongas cómodo... te espera un camino movidito.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00136=Je, je. Esos son los que me gustan...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00137=¡Vamos, equipo rojo! ¡A ver de qué estáis hechos! Estoy listo para la segunda parte.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00138=¡Grrraaar!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00139=Espero que estés listo, Raynor. ¡Esto se pone serio!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00140=Nací listo, Uther...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00141=Recuerda, si recibes daño puedes volver a la Cámara de las Tormentas y tus heridas se curarán en el tiempo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00142=Como antes, nuestro objetivo es luchar contra el equipo enemigo y destruir su núcleo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00143=Según lo veo yo, hay tres caminos hacia la base del enemigo, así que será mejor asegurarnos de que cada uno cubra uno.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00144=Ya estás listo, muchacho. Al comenzar la batalla, sígueme y prepárate para la lucha.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00145=Cada vez que destruyes estructuras, esbirros o héroes enemigos, nuestro equipo gana experiencia.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00146=Ganamos experiencia juntos, y todo lo que haces contribuye al éxito de nuestro equipo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00147=Esta barra muestra la experiencia de ambos equipos.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00148=Cuando la barra azul se llena del todo, nuestro equipo sube de nivel y todos nos volvemos más fuertes.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00149=Pues vayamos a por un nivel.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00150=¡Bien hecho, hemos subido de nivel!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00151=Tus estadísticas y habilidades se han vuelto más poderosas.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00152=Eso suena bastante útil. ¿Tienes más cosas divertidas para mí?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00153=Subir de nivel desbloquea talentos y te permite personalizar tus habilidades y tu forma de luchar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00154=¡Eh! ¡No está mal! Ya me siento más fuerte.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00155=Has desbloqueado tu habilidad heroica, es increíblemente poderosa y podría cambiar el curso de la batalla. Ten cuidado cuando la uses.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00156=Habilidad heroica, ¿eh? Tengo ganas de probar eso.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00157=Maldita sea. No me siento bien.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00158=Acude a una fuente de sanación. Haz clic derecho en ella para recuperar salud.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00159=Ve a una fuente de sanación. Haz clic izquierdo en ella para recuperar salud.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00160=Acude a una fuente de sanación. Haz clic en ella para recuperar salud.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00161=Bien hecho. Al beber de una fuente, tu salud y tu maná se regenerarán poco a poco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00162=Pero tendrás que esperar a que se llene la fuente para poder volver a beber de ella.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00163=¡Raynor, retírate ahora!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00164=Tengo que replegarme.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00165=Raynor, nos vendría bien tu ayuda aquí. Vamos a "animar" a alguno de estos gigantes de asedio a que se unan a nuestro bando.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00166=¿Animar?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00167=Oh, es más divertido de lo que suena. Créeme...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00168=¿Puedes quedarte en la baliza un momento?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00169=Ya está. Cuando un campamento de mercenarios es derrotado, se unirán a nosotros y atacarán por el camino más cercano.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00170=Bueno, sigamos a estas alimañas de asedio hasta el fuerte del enemigo y reventemos esa cosa.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00171=Los gigantes de asedio son eficaces para destruir fuertes a distancia.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00172=Raynor, necesitamos refuerzos. Intenta tomar tú solo el campamento de mercenarios.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00173=No olvides usar tus habilidades para derrotarlos.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00174=Bueno, esas rocas van bastante despacio. Seguro que puedo esquivarlas.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00175=Raynor, ve a esa torre de vigilancia. Si la consigues para nuestro equipo, nos otorgará visión en esa zona.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00176=Quédate ahí un momento y la torre de vigilancia se activará.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00177=Retírate, muchacho. Es peligroso atacar una torre sin nuestros esbirros.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00178=Ten cuidado, no hay esbirros para protegerte de esa torre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00179=Aprisa, muchacho. Necesitamos tu ayuda con estos gigantes de asedio.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00180=Debería ayudar a Uther antes de que el abuelo se ponga gruñón... aún más.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00181=Raynor, necesito tu ayuda en este camino.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00182=Nota a mí mismo: usar las habilidades con más frecuencia.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00183=Tu salud se agota: ve a una fuente de sanación.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00184=Te has quedado sin maná. Bebe de una fuente de sanación o vuelve a la base con la piedra de hogar para recuperar salud y maná en el tiempo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00185=Igual habría que tomar un campamento de mercenarios.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00186=Poca salud, y la fuente está seca. Mejor utilizar la piedra de hogar y sanarme en la base.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00187=Monta y podrás llegar más rápido al frente.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00188=Sobre montura te desplazas mucho más rápido. La tecla por defecto para la montura es la Z.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00189=No hay tiempo que perder, marshal. Elige un camino y prepárate para luchar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00190=¡Menos mal, una esfera de regeneración! Falta me hacía.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00191=No olvides elegir un talento, muchacho.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00192=El enemigo ha tomado nuestra torre de vigilancia. Si podemos, deberíamos recuperarla.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00193=Un proyectil penetrante mataría rápidamente a estos enemigos.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00194=¡Raynor, utiliza tu habilidad Inspirar para reforzar nuestros ataques!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00195=Haz clic derecho para cancelar una habilidad. Si quieres utilizar una habilidad, haz clic izquierdo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00196=Haz clic izquierdo para cancelar una habilidad. Si quieres utilizar una habilidad, haz clic derecho.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00197=Acabas de cancelar una habilidad. Asegúrate de usar el botón del ratón correcto para disparar tu Proyectil penetrante.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00198=Haz clic derecho para cancelar una habilidad. Haz clic izquierdo para llamar al Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00199=Haz clic izquierdo para cancelar una habilidad. Haz clic derecho para llamar al Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00200=Acabas de cancelar una habilidad. Asegúrate de utilizar el botón correcto del ratón para invocar el Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00201=Cuando te quede poca salud, cúrate bebiendo de una fuente de sanación o regresando a tu base con la piedra de hogar.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00202=No te precipites. Morir cargando con poca salud otorga experiencia a los enemigos y nos deja con un hombre menos.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00203=Utiliza la piedra de hogar para regresar a nuestro núcleo, pero asegúrate de estar oculto o lejos de los enemigos al utilizarla.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00204=¡Eh! ¡Has interrumpido mi piedra de hogar!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00205=La piedra de hogar tarda un rato y los enemigos pueden interrumpirla. Úsala solo en zonas seguras.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00206=Diría que es el momento perfecto para llamar al Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00207=Seguro que, si pudiese llamar al Hyperion, podríamos acabar con esos tipos.

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed01=Fuerza en la unidad.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed02=Este reino plantea muchas preguntas y ofrece pocas respuestas...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed03=¿Participaron los Xel'Naga en la creación del Nexo? Si fue así, no han dejado templos... ni nuevas formas de vida...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed04=Salvo que esas formas de vida estén ocultas... y nos controlen con algún complejo mecanismo digital. Una red de redes...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed05=¡Incluso puede que estas formas de vida estén manipulándonos a la vez! Argh... Ya vale, me está dando dolor de cabeza.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed06=Me pregunto qué harán los daelaam en mi ausencia. Espero que no hayan reordenado el mobiliario de mi cámara del consejo. Odio cuando hacen eso.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed07=¿Así que la Lanza de Adun está ahí arriba... pero no hay ni rastro del forjador de fase Karax? Típico.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed08=¿Puedes dejar de darme toquecitos? ¡Redirige tu agresión a uno de los orcos! ¡A ver cómo se lo toman!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed09=Por cierto, lo que dije es que StarCraft no era Warcraft en el espacio... Sea lo que sea Heroes of the Storm, no cuenta.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed10=Sí, mi nave me sigue a todas partes. Es como lo que los humanos llamáis mascota, solo que más útil.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed11=No llevo mucho tiempo como Jerarca, pero ya pienso en progresar en mi carrera. Con un poco de suerte, pronto seré... Jerarconte.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed12=¿Qué te parece la nueva armadura? La anterior no dejaba mucho espacio a la imaginación.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed13=Soy joven para ser un protoss, pero he vivido dos siglos más que la mayoría de humanos, así que un respeto a la edad.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed14=Viví la intensidad y no encontré más que constelaciones y estrellas.... Puedo llegar hasta el final, a mi manera.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected00=He sido indultado.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected01=Te lo agradezco.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive00=Debemos permanecer unidos.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive01=No puedo fracasar.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec00=Inteligente.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec01=Estoy intrigado.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec02=Ah, así que ese es el plan.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec03=Buena estrategia.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec04=Me será de ayuda.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt00=Te comportas como si fueses de una civilización menos... avanzada.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt01=Si tu estupidez no te mata, mis cuchillas lo harán.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt02=Mi meditación ha concluido. ¿La tuya ha empezado?

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked00=En este reino debemos asumir responsabilidad por nuestras acciones.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Veo que no actúas de forma impulsiva. Te admiro por ello.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=El tiempo de reflexión ha expirado.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hay batallas en curso. ¡No debemos retrasarnos!

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/IntroQuestion_Murky00=¿Qué clase de abominación zerg es esta?
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/IntroQuestion_Negative00=De todos los aliados posibles, ¿tenías que ser tú?
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Me complace luchar junto a un guerrero como tú.

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/IntroResponse_Negative00=No necesito el Khala para saber qué opinas.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/IntroResponse_Positive00=¡El enemigo caerá ante nuestro embate!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/IntroResponse_Raynor00=Perdido en el Nexo y a punto de entrar en combate, pero por lo demás... aceptable.

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/LowLifeHeal02=Tu apoyo es vital.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/LowMana00=Me falta maná.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/LowMana01=Tengo poco maná.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/LowMana02=Necesito más maná.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/No00=No.

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed00=El amanecer vendrá.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed01=Fuerza en la unidad.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed02=Este reino plantea muchas preguntas y ofrece pocas respuestas...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed03=¿Participaron los Xel'Naga en la creación del Nexo? Si fue así, no han dejado templos... ni nuevas formas de vida...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed04=Salvo que esas formas de vida estén ocultas... y nos controlen con algún complejo mecanismo digital. Una red de redes...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed05=¡Incluso puede que estas formas de vida estén manipulándonos a la vez! Argh... Ya vale, me está dando dolor de cabeza.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed06=Me pregunto qué harán los daelaam en mi ausencia. Espero que no hayan reordenado el mobiliario de mi cámara del consejo. Odio cuando hacen eso.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed07=¿Así que la Lanza de Adun está ahí arriba... pero no hay ni rastro del forjador de fase Karax? Típico. Al menos no está dando guerra con la solarita.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed08=¿Así que la Lanza de Adun está ahí arriba... pero no hay ni rastro del forjador de fase Karax? Típico.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed09=¿Puedes dejar de darme toquecitos? ¡Redirige tu agresión a uno de los orcos! ¡A ver cómo se lo toman!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed10=Por cierto, lo que dije es que StarCraft no era Warcraft en el espacio... Sea lo que sea Heroes of the Storm, no cuenta.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed11=Sí, mi nave me sigue a todas partes. Es como lo que los humanos llamáis mascota, solo que más útil.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed12=No llevo mucho como Jerarca, pero ya pienso en progresar en mi carrera. Con un poco de suerte, pronto seré... Jerarconte.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed13=¿Qué te parece la nueva armadura? La anterior no dejaba mucho espacio a la imaginación.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed14=Soy joven para ser un protoss, pero he vivido dos siglos más que la mayoría de humanos, así que un respeto a la edad.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed15=Viví la intensidad y no encontré más que constelaciones y estrellas.... Puedo llegar hasta el final, a mi manera.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected00=He sido indultado.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected01=Te lo agradezco.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Revive00=Debemos permanecer unidos.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Revive01=No puedo fracasar.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec00=Inteligente.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec01=Estoy intrigado.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec02=Ah, así que ese es el plan.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec03=Buena estrategia.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec04=Me será de ayuda.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt00=Te comportas como si fueses de una civilización menos... avanzada.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt01=Si tu estupidez no te mata, mis cuchillas lo harán.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt02=Mi meditación ha concluido. ¿La tuya ha empezado?
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/TeamKilled00=Esto es solo la oscuridad previa al amanecer.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_ExLocked00=Para triunfar, debemos permanecer unidos.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_ExPurchased00=Harak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Gift00=Ofrezco mi ayuda con gusto.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Lockin00=Nuestro momento ha llegado.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Purchase00=¡Luchamos por una causa!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial00=Un templario nunca acaba su entrenamiento.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial01=Aprecio los desafíos.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked00=En este reino debemos asumir responsabilidad por nuestras acciones.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked01=Veo que no actúas de forma impulsiva. Te admiro por ello.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased00=El tiempo de reflexión ha expirado.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hay batallas en curso. ¡No debemos retrasarnos!

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed03=Calla y juega.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed04=Solo hay una regla en la Cancha Abrasadora: si no juegas con los mejores, mueres con los demás.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed05=La Cancha Abrasadora y el Alto Estadio llevan eones enfrentándose en las Finales Eternas. Cuando acabe la temporada, habrá que quitar eso de "ganar con dos de ventaja".
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed06=Vigila tus espaldas, Diablo. ¡Este año el título de jugador más valioso será mío!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed07=El juicio ha comenzado, mortales, y aquí yo soy juez, jurado y verdugo.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed09=Mis fans saben que vengo de los barrios bajos, pero no se imaginan lo bajos que son.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed10=Primero reviento el tablero y luego tu mundo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed11=¿Por qué nos peleamos por Santuario? Porque allí se juegan las finales y el que tenga Santuario contará con la ventaja de jugar en casa.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed12=Estoy harto de los nephalem y de sus concursos de mates. ¡Cuando yo era un novato me centraba en lo básico!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed13=Malthael era de lo mejorcito que tenían en el Alto Estadio. Fue una suerte para la Cancha Abrasadora que decidiera ir por libre.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed14=Te contaré un secreto: nunca es cosa de los zapatos... De hecho, ni siquiera me valen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed15=Una vez pusieron mi cara en una caja de cereales, pero a los críos se les quitaban las ganas de desayunar, vete a saber por qué.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB00=Marcadlos.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Mm... ¿De qué parte del infierno vienes tú?

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed04=Si mi forma actual te impresiona... ¡espera a ver las amenazas de mi cabeza flotante!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed05=Liderar a los tenientes del pecado no es fácil. Pereza llega tarde, Cólera es agresivo, y Orgullo cree que Codicia nos roba. Envidia tiene celos de que Codicia se salga con la suya, y Gula intenta comerse a todos. En cuanto a Lujuria... es una GRAN distracción.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed09=Dicen que Azmodan es pecado y es mortal, y al infierno me condenan.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed10=¿No te gusta tu familia? Yo crecí con los Señores del Infierno. Nuestras peleas de hermanos devastaban reinos.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed11=A los que creen que solo hay siete pecados capitales les falta imaginación.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed12=Esto empieza a doler más que mis piercings.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed13=¿Podéis parar todos un momento? ¡Tengo que preparar unos cuantos documentos sobre la historia de esta batalla y pasar un rato escondiéndolos por ahí!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed14=¿Qué? ¿Cómo osas referirte a mí como demonio "menor"? Prefiero el término "demonio mayor en potencia".
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed15=Te vas a llevar un zas-modan en toda la boca.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/TeamKilled00=Una victoria inútil. ¡Al final triunfaremos!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExLocked00=¡Soy el verdadero Señor del Infierno!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExPurchased00=¿Dónde se esconden nuestros enemigos?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Gift00=Los haré mis sirvientes.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Lockin00=¡Así comienza!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Purchase00=Sabia elección.

VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed01=Escoge bien cada palabra.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed02=El próximo que me ponga de nombre "Barbie" en Battle.net se lleva un hacha en la frente de regalo.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed03=Bul-Kathos, jamás te había rezado antes, no sirvo para ello. Nadie recordará por qué luchamos o por qué morimos. Lo único que importa es que cinco se enfrentan a cinco. Concédeme, pues, una petición: ¡mejora mi índice de asignación de partidas! Y si no me escuchas, ¡vete al INFIERNO!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed04=Veamos... Aplastar enemigos... hecho. Verlos destrozados... vale. Oír el lamento de sus mujeres... Bueno, eso creo que me lo salto.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed05=¡Tú! ¡Muerte por kiki!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed06=Las rubias se lo pasan mejor, pero con las pelirrojas TE lo pasas mejor.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed07=¡Los pelirrojos sí que tienen alma! ¿Vale?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed08=No paro de matar y no sale botín. Este juego no tiene sentido.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed09=¿Has soñado alguna vez que vas a trabajar en ropa interior? Ese es mi día a día.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed10=Si encuentro al que inventó el bikini de cota de malla le arranco la cabeza a puñetazos.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed11=En uno de mis viajes, un cerdo me pidió que le hiciera un bocadillo... así que lo corté en lonchas muy finas.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed12=¿Sabes? Llevaba años esperando el modo jugador-contra-jugador.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed13=Espera, a ver que me aclare. Clic derecho para moverme... Clic derecho para atacar... ¿Y el clic izquierdo? Ugh, odio tener que aprender controles nuevos.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed14=En mi país hay un proverbio que dice: "Cuando nieve, ponte el taparrabos largo".
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed15=Mis espadas son más grandes que las tuyas. Oh, vamos, no te preocupes. Le pasa a muchos hombres.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Resurrected00=Te debo la vida.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Resurrected01=Estoy en deuda contigo.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Revive00=Ancestros, otorgadme fortaleza.

VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Purchase00=Oro bien gastado.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Trial00=Mi voz es mi acero.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Trial01=Estoy deseando ponerme a prueba.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitLocked00=Me canso de esperar. Bañemos nuestras armas con sangre enemiga.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitLocked01=Vamos, nuestros enemigos ansían ser empalados.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitPurchased00=Sigamos, me estoy quedando sin furia.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitPurchased01=Sigue mirando, te voy a sacar los ojos.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ultimate1Used00=¡Allá voy!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ultimate1Used01=Hora de morir.

VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed05=El brebaje casero es el mejor... ¡porque no tienes que salir para beberlo!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed06=Si pasas por la zona, visita la Cervecería del Trueno. Parece que siempre hay cosas que hacer.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed07=Un hombre sabio me dijo una vez: "Una jarra vacía es solo una que aún no se ha vuelto a llenar". Ejem.

VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed09=Ah, y beber mucha agua. Eso también es importante.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed10=No todo el que vaga está perdido... Pero sí, yo sí que lo estoy.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed11=Para algunos, el viaje ES el destino.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed12=La vida del vagabundo es observar... beber de la cultura de otros y aprovechar ese conocimiento para llevar una vida satisfactoria. Sin embargo, la vida del vagabundo oscuro... eh... digamos que acaba mal.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed13=Preguntar por qué luchamos es preguntar por qué juegas a Heroes of the Storm. Es por la experiencia. Tal vez no sea la pregunta adecuada.

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack00=¡Temblad ante Zakarum!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack01=¡Por la Luz!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack02=¡Como el tamo delante del viento!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack03=¡Que la Luz os maldiga!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack04=¡La cruzada sigue adelante!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack05=¡Arded bajo la Luz!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack06=Resignaos. Rápido.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Celebrate00=¡Lo conseguimos!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Celebrate01=Una gran victoria. ¡Pero aún no hemos acabado!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Comeback00=Pronto superaremos al enemigo. ¡Seguid luchando!

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Healed01=Mis heridas se cierran.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Healed02=Te lo agradezco.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroAgree00=Akarat nos acompaña.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroAgree01=Entonces, comencemos.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroAgree02=Por supuesto.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroBoast00=Casi siento pena por nuestro enemigo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroBoast01=Esto no debería durar mucho.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion00=¿Listos para la batalla que comienza?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion01=Prepárate.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=No reveles nuestros planes al enemigo. En serio. Ni una palabra.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Intenta no quedarte atascado en alguna puerta.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=¡Más nephalem! Supongo que los esbirros del infierno se hacen más fuertes.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=¿Hasta los demonios han acabado en este conflicto?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_DiabloHero00=Hace mucho que no luchas. ¿Estás en forma?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Tu maldad no debería poder vagar libremente.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Vale, otra alianza temporal.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil02=Tus días de maldad están contados.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good00=Me alegra poder luchar junto a aliados en los que puedo confiar.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good01=Ah, eres tú. Eso hará las cosas más sencillas.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good02=Hagamos triunfar el bien en el campo de batalla.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Imperius00=¿Imperius, soportarás luchar al lado de una mortal?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Leoric, ¿qué se siente al estar en el bando correcto por una vez?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Lord00=¿Un Señor del Infierno luchando a mi lado? El fin de los tiempos está cerca.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=¿No te he matado unas cuantas veces, Malthael?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Mephisto00=El Señor del Odio. Muy impresionante, estoy segura.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=¿Has pensado en mi oferta, Murky? Me vendría bien un aprendiz.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=¿De verdad crees que mereces luchar a mi lado?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Estando en el mismo equipo... ¿Acaso nuestro enemigo tiene alguna oportunidad?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Tyrael, es un honor luchar a tu lado.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=¿Crees que estarás a la altura, paladín?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond00=Siempre estoy lista.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond01=La cruzada me ha traído aquí.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond02=Siempre.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Es peligroso provocar a una cruzada.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=¿Eso es todo? Esperaba un discurso sobre cómo nunca podría derrotarte. Otra vez.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Qué miedo. Igual deberías probar eso con los enemigos.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=Perdona... ¿qué?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=De todas formas podremos con ellos.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Bueno, ¿me lo cuentas todo después de la batalla?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=La opinión de un demonio nunca me ha importado.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_DiabloHero00=Derrotemos a nuestro enemigo y luego pensaremos en cómo volver a casa.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=<sigh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil00=Preferiría mil veces luchar contra ti que a tu lado.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil01=El mundo sería un lugar mucho mejor sin ti.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil02=¿Es tarde para pedir nuevos aliados?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=Esa es una causa que puedo apoyar.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good00=Como ordene Akarat, camarada.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good01=Yo seré vuestro escudo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good02=Juntos, ¡venceremos!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Imperius00=Vaya, Imperius, tú por aquí. Parece que no exigen mucho para entrar...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=He tenido peores compañías. ¿Has conocido a Lyndon?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Lord00=Lo mismo te digo, demonio.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=Luchamos juntos, Malthael, así que no voy a destruirte. Probablemente.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto00=Ja, ja, ja. Los halagos no te servirán de nada.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Tan sabio como siempre, mi elocuente amigo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=De momento seremos aliados. Centrémonos en los verdaderos enemigos.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_No00=No pienso darte la satisfacción de responderte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=¡Aquí estamos de nuevo! Seremos imparables.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Y yo, Tyrael.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=Yo sí. Paladín, sabes que nadie te juzgará si no estás a mi altura. Tengo mucha más clase.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=La cosa no funciona así.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill00=Que Akarat se apiade de ti; yo no lo haré.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill01=¡La cruzada viene a por ti!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill02=Al menos lo intentaste.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill03=Hasta la próxima.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill04=¡Hoy no es tu día!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillAngel00=¡Vuelve a los cielos!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillButcher00=He vengado a los espíritus de los muertos.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDeckard00=Lo siento, viejo amigo. A lo mejor deberías hablar menos.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDemon00=¡En este reino no puedes ocultarte de mí, demonio!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiablo00=¿Cuántas veces van, Diablo? Siempre pierdo la cuenta.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiabloHero00=Tu tiempo ha pasado, nephalem.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillImperius00=Te lo merecías desde hace tiempo, charlatán.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillLeoric00=Vuelve a tu mazmorra, Leoric.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillMephisto00=¿No se suponía que tú eras el inteligente?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillNephalem00=Lo siento, nephalem.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillSpreeEnd00=¡Ya basta!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillTyrael00=Es la era de los nephalem, viejo amigo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillUther00=Paladines... ¡Ja!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillWhitemane00=Una fanática menos.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh00=<laugh>

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal00=¡Ha estado cerca!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal01=Una curación excelente.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal02=Demasiado al límite.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana00=No tengo maná.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana01=Me quedo sin maná.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana02=Necesito más maná.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No01=No puedo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No02=Ahora no.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistHero00=¡Nuestro aliado necesita ayuda!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe00=¡Necesito ayuda!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe01=¡Me vendría bien vuestra ayuda!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=¡A por el núcleo del enemigo, ahora!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Convirtamos a estos mercenarios.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=¡Arrasemos este fuerte!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Tomad la torre de vigilancia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=¡Debemos defender el núcleo!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Debemos resistir en este fuerte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Defended esta torre de vigilancia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_KillHero00=Hay que eliminar a ese héroe... y pronto.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed00=Hola.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed01=¿Sí? ¿Qué necesitas?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed02=¿Por qué haces clic en mí y no en mis enemigos o en el botín? ¿Qué clase de juego es este?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed03=¿Bromas? ¿Quieres bromas? Vale, supongo que algo podré hacer.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed04=Un cruzado, un paladín y un templario entran en una taberna. Y van y se toman algo.... ¿No era así?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed05=... No todos pillan el humor de los cruzados.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed06=Algún día redimiré la fe Zakarum y la cruzada acabará. ¿Qué haré entonces? Bueno, seguro que encuentro cosas que fulminar.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed07=El "Nexo" me resulta bastante extraño. Algo sobre cómo la luz ilumina todo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed08=Lo más importante cuando llevas una armadura pesada es no pensar NUNCA en cuánto te pica... Oh, vaya... Va a ser un día largo...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed09=Oh, Akarat, bendice este mangual para que, armada con su luz, pueda fulminar a los enemigos en humildes pedazos. Alabado seas.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed10=Llevo el nombre de mi maestra, como su maestra hizo con la suya. Algún día mi aprendiza llevará el mío y encontrará a alguien que lo herede. En resumen, que todas nos llamamos igual.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed11=Nuestras armas son el miedo, la sorpresa, una eficiencia despiadada y una devoción casi fanática por Akarat. No, espera, vuelvo a empezar.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed12=Ayer alguien me preguntó si era una templaria. Le repliqué: ¿Acaso me has oído gritar "¡Glorioso!"?. Ahora sí, respondió. Era ingenioso... una pena que esté muerto.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed13=Haz clic en mí una vez más, y juro por Akarat que te corto el dedo, o lo que sea que utilices con el ratón.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected00=Te estoy agradecida.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected01=Te lo agradezco.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive00=¡Regreso!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive01=De vuelta a la batalla.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive02=Debería buscarme pronto una aprendiza.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec00=Buena elección.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec01=Excelente.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec02=La Luz me hace más fuerte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec03=Como debe ser.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec04=Me parece bien.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt00=Si hay héroes de verdad en vuestro bando, que vengan.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt01=No duraríais mucho en la cruzada.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt02=Mi aprendiza podría contigo... ¡y ni siquiera tengo una!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/TeamKilled00=He salido de situaciones peores. No perdáis la esperanza.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExLocked00=Saludos.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Me alegro de verte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Gift00=Tu espíritu es generoso.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Lockin00=La cruzada llama.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Purchase00=Has elegido sabiamente.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial00=¡Vamos a probar!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial01=¿Quieres unirte a la cruzada?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Piensas antes de actuar. Una decisión sabia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Te gusta darle vueltas a las cosas.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=La cruzada nos llama.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hay cierta belleza en la quietud. Matémosla.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate1Used00=Que caiga la cólera de los cielos.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used00=La fe es mi escudo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used01=¡Hasta aquí habéis llegado!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used02=¡Alto!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used03=¡Ahí va!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used04=Esto acaba aquí.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_KillHero00=Deberíamos acabar con este héroe.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed00=Soy la primera dríade.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed01=El bosque no necesita protección, pero tú sí.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed02=Recuperaremos lo que los mortales robaron.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed03=Mi padre, Cenarius, tiene poder. Pero yo tengo determinación.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed04=No me malinterpretes: a los mortales se les da genial matarse entre ellos, pero a los bosques se les da aún mejor.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed05=Hay algo muy extraño en las plantas del Jardín del Terror... ¿Qué utilizarán como abono?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed06=Las dríades no pastan. Me ofende que pienses lo contrario.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed07=Confieso que solo como cosas orgánicas. Tú harías lo mismo si los goblins trabajaran las minas de tu tierra.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed08=Se podría decir que soy todo un fenómeno de la naturaleza.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed09=¿Recuerdas cuando te decían que salieras a jugar fuera, que era completamente seguro? Eso es porque no habían oído hablar de mí.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed10=Entonces dijo: "¡Qué poco aprovechada estoy!". Y yo le contesté que, si no cerraba el pico de inmediato, esas serían sus últimas palabras.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed11=No hay nada más hermoso que la naturaleza, con todos esos venenos, espinas, y esas pequeñas vides estranguladoras. Podría pasarme el día mirándolas.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed12=¡Me apunto! Tampoco es que tenga otra opción en esta guerra entre humanos y bosques, el bien contra el mal, azul contra rojo.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed13=Oye, yo no elegí llamarme Lunara. Mi padre me llamó así por mi abuela. Este anciano, siempre pensando en los viejos tiempos...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed14=Tú llámame mi Lunita y te demostraré la gravedad de tu error... a base de pezuña.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed15=Muchas dríades hablan ciervo, conejo y ave con fluidez, pero yo también hablo serpiente, oso y algún dialecto escorpión poco común.<hissing>Sssh. Ssh. ¡SSSH!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed16=Seguro que nunca has ido a una fiesta dríade. ¡Se bebe más zumo de baya lunar que en toda la Feria de la Luna Negra!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed17=(Mostrando a alguien cómo moverse como una dríade) Así es como se retoza: salto y brinco, salto y brinco, salto... y, por supuesto, brinco.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed18=Has arruinado tus tierras, ¡pero no arruinarás las mías!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected00=No está nada mal.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected01=Gracias. Esto no ha acabado.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive00=Soy eterna.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive01=La vida se abre camino.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive02=Mi lucha no ha acabado.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt00=¿Qué pasa? ¿Tienes alergia? <laughs>
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt01=Quizás hayas conocido dríades encantadoras... pero yo no soy una de ellas.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt02=Vas a ser un abono excelente.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/TeamKilled00=Si nos cortas, ¡volveremos a crecer!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExLocked00=Propicios días, ¿algún quebranto?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Los aliados del bosque son bienvenidos.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Lockin00=La caza ha empezado.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Purchase00=¡La bendición de la naturaleza cae sobre ti!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial00=Bueno, vale.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial01=Mientras no me lleve demasiado tiempo...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Añoro los prados de Kalimdor...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Las tierras salvajes me llaman.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Llevo mucho tiempo esperando.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=¡Deja de mirarme! No voy a hacer nada adorable, ¿sabes?

VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelectPlayer00=¡Mira, estoy ahí abajo! ¡Hola, yo! ¿Quién es el goblin más guapo? ¡Tú!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelectPlayer01=¿Quieres que luche y hable a la vez? Por mí vale, pero te costará el doble.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelectPlayer02=¿Alguna vez has tenido una experiencia extracorpórea? ¿No? Pues es raro, créeme.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelect_Observer00=Muy bien, los dos equipos se preparan. Oh, esta va a ser grande.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain00=Bueno, has muerto. Lo superarás.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain01=¿Qué me he perdido? Estaba mirando para otro lado.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain02=Oh, has muerto... ¿Me puedo quedar con tu radio?
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain03=Eso tiene que doler.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain04=Vale, vuelve a tu cadáver y... Ahí va, ya no está. Pues nada, a esperar.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain05=¿Te acuerdas de cuando te moriste? Ah, que ha sido ahora. Olvídalo.

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed_W02=Gracias por la curación.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree00=Esta es una alianza que puedo aceptar.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree01=Tu determinación es impresionante.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree02=Esta manada cazará bien.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroBoast00=Nuestros enemigos maldecirán este día.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroBoast01=Con espada o colmillo, prevaleceremos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion00=Será mejor que estéis listos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion01=¿Os habéis preparado para la batalla?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Traicionaste a tu gente, Arthas. No hay mayor crimen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Baelog00=Lucharía con garras y dientes para volver a mi hogar. ¿Y tú?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Erik00=Mi mayor deseo es restaurar Gilneas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Kael'thas00=Quel'Thalas no es aliada de Gilneas, pero supongo que tendremos que cooperar.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=No hay nada que más odie que un monarca no-muerto.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Lunara00=Tranquila, dríade. Tengo más afinidad con la naturaleza que otros humanos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=No acepto ayuda fácilmente, archidruida. Gracias por el ofrecimiento de todas formas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Tengo entendido que Ventormenta considera a los tuyos una amenaza.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Aliados como tú me hacen desear luchar solo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Si he de aceptar ayuda, me alegra que venga de ti.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_RehgarSW00=¿Eso que llevas en la cabeza es una piel de lobo?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=¿Crees que somos aliados? Cuando esto acabe, te mataré a ti también.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Puede que ambos seamos reyes, pero yo lidero a la manada.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond00=Un verdadero gilneano siempre está preparado.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond01=He visto muchas guerras, y esta no será distinta.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond02=Esto es lo que ocurre cuando me presionan demasiado.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Ana00=Esto es lo que ocurre cuando me presionan demasiado.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=¡No pongas a prueba mi paciencia!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Todo lo que hice fue por Gilneas. Tú solo actuaste en tu propio beneficio.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Baelog00=Calla o verás mis colmillos de cerca.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Esperaba tener aliados de confianza. Pero supongo que tendré que conformarme contigo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Erik00=¡Soy un HUARGEN! ¡H-U-A-R-G-E-N! ¡Huargen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Kael'thas00=Puede que los míos se hayan convertido en huargen, pero tú casi conviertes a los tuyos en demonios.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=¿Pericia en qué, exactamente? ¿En llevar a tu pueblo a la ruina o en ser asesinado por él?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Lunara00=Ah, la mujer que es casi un ciervo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=Hoy pago la deuda que mi gente te debía.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=¡Ja! Y pensar que una criatura como tú puede provocar semejante caos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Si dependiera de mí, tú estarías en el bando contrario.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=Nuestros destinos están unidos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Formas parte de los pocos individuos en los que puedo confiar, ¿sabes?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_RehgarSW00=Ah, Rehgar. El orco empeñado en ser un lobo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Y puede que tu gente pierda al suyo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Tú solo te comportas como un lobo, yo me convierto en uno.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill00=¡Cae ante mí!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill01=No tenías ninguna posibilidad.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill02=Muere como un perro.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill03=Disfruta de la hospitalidad gilneana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill04=<Ahem> ¿Siguiente?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas00=Terenas, que esto sirva de resarcimiento.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas_W00=He hecho lo que Terenas no pudo hacer.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh00=Y ahora a por el resto de tu despreciable Horda.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh_W00=Lo'Gosh no es el lobo que debería preocuparte.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKael'thas00=Vuelve a tu preciada Fuente del Sol.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKaelthas_W00=Agh, me has chamuscado el pelaje.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric00=Tal es el destino de los reyes indignos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric_W00=Tranquilo, Leoric, enterraré tus huesos... en cuanto acabe con ellos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara00=Parece que la naturaleza necesitaba protección de los humanos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara_W00=Parece que la naturaleza me ha favorecido a mí esta vez.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion00=Te pido perdón, archidruida, pero era necesario.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion_W00=Quizás tuvieras razón, Malfurion. Esta "forma de manada" es peligrosa.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Casi pierdo el control.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpree_W00=¡Soy el alfa!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas00=¡Justicia para Liam! ¡Para todos los gilneanos!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas_W00=¡Por fin derramo tu pútrida sangre!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther00=Eras un héroe de la Alianza... pero no de Gilneas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther_W00=Siempre supe que morirías antes que yo, Uther.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillVarian_W00=¿Cuál era mi frase?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W00=¡Esta presa es mía!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W01=Gracias por afilarme las garras.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W02=Qué presa tan fácil.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W03=Esto de matar da hambre.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W04=Soy el mejor en lo que hago.

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal01=Mientras yo viva, vivirá Gilneas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal02=Elegante incluso bajo presión. Gracias por curarme.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W00=<Gasps> Eso estuvo cerca. Gracias.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W01=Desde las fauces de la muerte...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W02=Tu sanación me ha salvado la vida.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana00=No tengo maná.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana01=Necesito más maná.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana02=Tengo poco maná.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W00=Me estoy quedando sin maná.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W01=Tengo poco maná.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W02=Necesito recuperar maná.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No00=Jamás.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No01=No.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No02=Denegado.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W00=No puedo hacer eso.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W01=Imposible.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W02=Me niego.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero00=¡Nuestro aliado necesita ayuda!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero_W00=¡Alguien de nuestra manada nos necesita!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe00=¡Ayudadme!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe01=¡Acudid a mi posición!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W00=¡Atacad conmigo!

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=¡Acabad con esto! ¡Destruid su núcleo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle_W00=¡El golpe de gracia! ¡Destruid el núcleo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=¡Tomad este campamento y reforzad nuestras filas!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc_W00=Enseñadles a esos mercenarios quién manda aquí.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Es hora de arrasar el fuerte enemigo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost_W00=¡Derribad ese fuerte!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower00=¡Reclamad esta torre para nuestro equipo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower_W00=¡Tomad esta torre de vigilancia!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=¡Defended el núcleo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle_W00=¡Apartadlos de nuestro núcleo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=¡El fuerte no debe caer!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost_W00=¡Defended nuestro territorio!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower00=¡Mantened el control de la torre de vigilancia!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower_W00=¡Que no se hagan con nuestra torre!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero00=¡Descuartizad al enemigo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero_W00=¡Matar!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed00=¿Sí? ¡Habla de una vez!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed01=¡Te dirigirás a mí con el debido respeto!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed02=Me estoy enfadando. No te gustaría verme enfadado.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed03=He mandado a bufones a la picota por menos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed04=Hace tiempo, construí un muro altísimo para proteger a mi gente del mundo exterior. Me estás recordando por qué.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed05=Cuando recupere Gilneas, habrá que reconstruirlo. Me pregunto si los Defias seguirán disponibles...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed06=¿Mmm? Claro que la espada está solo para decorar. Tengo una pistola, ignorante.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed07=Quería poner una cabeza de lobo en la bandera de Gilneas, pero mis abogados decían no sé qué de derechos de autor.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed08=La Muralla de Cringrís evitaba todo contacto con el mundo exterior... Porque, por suerte, en Azeroth no hay manera de sobrevolar grandes estructuras o teletransportarse a una ubicación conocida.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed09=Esta pistola es un producto de la industria gilneana. Nada la supera en calibre.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed10=¿Has estado en el Castillo de Colmillo Oscuro? De joven pasaba mucho tiempo allí, pero últimamente no recibe visitas con tantos cambios en la dirección.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed11=Gilneas permaneció aislada del mundo durante veinte años, así que tendrás que disculparme si no pillo todas vuestras referencias culturales.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed12=¿Luna llena? ¿Esta noche? ¡No, me convertiré en un monstruo! Nah, es broma. Puedo transformarme y arrancarte la yugular cuando me plazca.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed13=Una vez un Renegado aporreó la puerta norte y gritó: "¡Soplaré y soplaré y vuestra muralla derribaré!". Nos echamos unas risas antes de cubrirlo con brea ardiente. ¡Qué días aquellos!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed14=Por cierto, ¿sabías que la Muralla de Cringrís es una de las pocas cosas que se puede ver desde el Vacío abisal? ¡Es cierto!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W00=¿Qué quieres?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W01=Habla.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Medivh00=¡El profeta Medivh! ¡Es un honor luchar junto a un mago de tu talla!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Mmm. Si hay un múrloc... ¿habrá más cerca, verdad?

VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=¡Me alegro de verte! Vamos a ganar esta batalla.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Sonya00=Yo los congelo y tú los aplastas. ¿Te parece bien?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_SonyaDK00=Sonya, ¿qué te ha pasado? ¿Eso es una hojarruna?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Hacía mucho que no luchábamos juntos, Thrall.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Lord Uther... Siento lo de Arthas. Si hubiese logrado convencerlo...

VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=No es buena idea contrariar a una maga.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=No me hables. Puede que te parezcas a Arthas, pero no tienes nada que ver con él.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Si crees que es lo mejor...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Alguien debería probar los beneficios de la menta.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Sonya00=¿"Me alegro de verte"? Creo que pasas mucho tiempo con Uther.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_SonyaDK00=No, Sonya... Arthas pagará por esto.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Me alegra que estemos en el mismo bando por una vez.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=No te imaginas cuánto he echado de menos tus consejos, Uther.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_ZagaraCrypt00=¡A mí no me hables en ese tono, insecto!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill00=Conmigo no se juega.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill01=¡Por el Kirin Tor!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill02=Eso debería darnos algo de tiempo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill03=Vete con viento fresco.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill04=Me he hartado de ti.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillArthas00=Por la Luz... descansa en paz, Arthas.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillDemon00=Acabaremos con los de tu calaña, demonio.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillDreadJaina00=¡Jamás me convertiré en algo como tú!

VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillHorde00=Ojalá hubiéramos podido resolver nuestras diferencias.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillJaina00=El frío a mí nunca me molestó...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillKael00=Eso debería pararte los pies un rato.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillMuradin00=Un guerrero no debería meterse con una maga Escarcha.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed00=¿Cuál es el plan?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed01=¡Shht! Estoy intentando pensar.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed02=Lo único que quería era estudiar. Pero claro, un demonio gigante arrasó mi hogar... así que tuve que dejarlo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed03=Me pregunto si mis hechizos de teletransporte funcionarán aquí. A ver... Azeroth metrion zinthos. Espera, creo que no era eso...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed04=Olvida lo de antes... AHORA se están poniendo raras las cosas. ¡Creo que he visto un enano hecho de caramelo!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed05=Espera. ¿Eso es una cana? Espero que no sea una mala señal.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed06=Está bien salir por ahí de vez en cuando. Me siento como si llevase años encerrada en una torre.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed07=Me pregunto por qué lo llaman polimorfia si siempre te convierte en lo mismo. Deberían haberlo llamado "monomorfia" o "el hechizo que convierte a la gente en oveja".
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed08=Soy una maga; y una de las buenas, sin duda.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed09=Cuando la gente me dice que soy un poco fría, les respondo... ¿Quién es el frío ahora?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed10=¿Qué le dice un pez mago a uno que no es mago? Nada por aquí, nada por allá.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed11=Las cosas claras... Esto no son trucos de magia... Son ilusiones. Los trucos son lo que haces en Halloween a cambio de caramelos.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed12=¿Perdona? ¿Thrall y yo? ¿Quién sigue difundiendo ese horrible rumor? Además, todos saben que prefiero el azul al verde.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed13=Además, los dos últimos hombres que se interesaron por mí intentaron dominar el mundo. Sí, mejor sigo estudiando...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed14=La Horda y la Alianza pueden coexistir. Lo he visto. Un solo acontecimiento podría bastar para unirnos.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed15=Por cierto, si quieres que haga algún chiste sobre Frozen, suéltalo. Oh, no... ¿Qué he hecho?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed16=Cuando mataron a mi hermano Derek, mi padre juró acabar con todos los orcos de Azeroth... Siempre me pregunto cómo llevaría yo una pérdida como esa. Rezo por no descubrirlo nunca.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed_Evo00=¿Cuál es.... el plan?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed_Evo01=Intentando pensar...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Resurrected00=Gracias.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Resurrected01=¡Gracias por el apoyo!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd00=Venganza bien fría. Justo como me gusta.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd01=Igual la próxima vez atiendes a razones.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd02=Bueno, un problema menos.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart00=Me estás calentando...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart01=Ahora te toca a ti.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart02=Odio recurrir a la violencia. Pero contigo haré una excepción.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive00=No es tan fácil acabar conmigo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive01=Aprisa, nuestros aliados nos necesitan.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive02=Vale, volvamos a intentarlo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Dance00=Un poco de magia.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroAgree00=Estoy de acuerdo.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroAgree01=Lo apruebo.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroAgree02=Desde luego.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroBoast00=Pronto mis enemigos sufrirán tanto como yo.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroBoast01=Que comience la masacre.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion00=¿Estáis listos para cubrir a nuestros enemigos con el manto de la muerte?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion01=La guerra se avecina. ¿Estáis preparados?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Me recuerdas a alguien. Ah sí, a mí.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=¿Esta vez vas a luchar o te limitarás a seguir diciendo que eres indestructible?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Cruzada... Parece que el destino ha decidido que luchemos juntos.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Bueno, ¿cómo va tu alianza con los ángeles?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=¿El infierno no bastaba para retenerte, demonio?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Cuando esto termine, tenemos temas por zanjar, amigo.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Monk00=¿No deberías haber muerto ya en una de tus temerarias búsquedas?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Se te acusa de traición al reino de Khanduras. ¿Cómo te declaras?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=No te preocupes. Mi pericia debería compensar de sobra tus deficiencias.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Agradezco tus servicios.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_RainDeath00=<DO NOT RECORD. REUSES AN INTRO LINE>

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroRespond02=Sí, que nuestros enemigos sientan nuestra ira.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Ana00=Me levantaré de nuevo. ¿Y tú?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Yo no sirvo a nadie. Al menos, yo llegué a ser rey antes de sucumbir a la locura.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Más que tú.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Yo siempre estoy del lado de lo correcto. Ojalá pudiera decir lo mismo de mis "aliados".
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Esto tampoco es de mi agrado.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=¿Por qué debe seguirme el mal incluso hasta aquí?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=No hay descanso para mí, abominación. Pero mi mente es libre.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Junkrat00=¿Cómo? ¿Osas burlarte de un rey?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Monk00=Prefiero el Rey Negro. Resulta más ominoso.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=¿Cómo? ¿Osas burlarte de un rey?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=A mí no me hables en ese tono.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_No00=<Reuses No02>
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Juntos seremos imparables.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Ah, conque me conoces, ángel. Y aun así te quedaste de brazos cruzados cuando Diablo destruyó mi reino.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill00=Todos son leales en la muerte.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill01=¡Pondré fin a esta conspiración!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill02=¡Un traidor menos!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill03=Nadie llorará tu muerte.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill04=Sirve a tu rey...
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillArthas00=Aquí solo hay sitio para un rey corrupto.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillAzmodan00=Al final, eres un mal menor.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillBarbarian00=Ahora podrás reunirte con el resto de tu gente, salvaje.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillButcher00=Eso por dejarme las mazmorras pringadas de sangre.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillCrusader00=Puede que esto frene esa lengua tuya.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillDemonHunter00=Saluda a tu hermana de mi parte.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillDiablo00=¡Justicia por mis hijos! Ah, y por volverme loco...
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillMonk00=Mil y un dioses, y ninguno pudo salvarte.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillSpreeEnd00=No estás a la altura.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillTyrael00=La justicia es una mentira.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillUther00=Los paladines son... insufribles.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowLifeHeal02=Me has arrancado de la garras del abismo.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowMana00=Me quedo sin maná.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowMana01=No tengo suficiente maná.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowMana02=Necesito maná.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_KillHero00=¡Matad a este héroe!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed00=¡Cómo osas!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed01=¿Quién perturba al Rey de Khanduras?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed02=Ya estoy muerto. Entonces, ¿qué me pasa cuando me matan? ¿Estoy más muerto? ¿Muertísimo? ¿Vivo?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed03=No es nada fácil compaginar una familia, un reino y el alma de un demonio mayor.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed04=Los campesinos me llamaban loco... ¡paranoico! ¿Es paranoia pensar que todos quieren matarte? ¿Lo es? ¿Lo es? ¿Lo es? ¿Y qué pasa cuando lo hacen de verdad?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed05=Los huesos viejos solo temen una cosa: la osteoporosis.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed06=¿Alguien más oye las voces? ¿Qué? No... ¡Sí! ¡Sí, sí! Pronto TODOS las oirán.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed07=¡Tú! ¡Devuélveme mi tibia!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed08=Soy el Rey Esqueleto, no el Rey de los Esqueletos. Cuidado con el matiz.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed09=¿Héroes? ¿Te refieres a esos vagabundos que allanan mi morada, rompen mi colección de jarrones, me traen de vuelta a la vida solo para volver a matarme y me dejan el suelo perdido de trastos? Sí, claro, muy heroico.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed10=¿Sientes eso? Va a llover otra vez.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed11=Me sigue la oscuridad. Yo también la sigo a ella, pero no escribe mucho.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed12=No me mires así, mis chistes son para caerse de cóccix. ¿No te parecen lo maxilar? ¡Qué poco sentido del húmero!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed13=La pierna se conecta con el muslo. El muslo se conecta con la costilla. La costilla se conecta con el hombro.... Nunca debí desmontar esto.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed14=Bebe leche. Es bueno para los huesos.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Resurrected00=¿Quién me llama al mundo de los vivos?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Resurrected01=El descanso eterno tendrá que esperar.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive00=¡No hay tumba que pueda retenerme!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive01=¡Gobernaré eternamente!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive02=Lo que está muerto no puede morir.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec00=Sí. Justo lo que necesita un rey.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec01=¡Me corresponde por derecho!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec02=Un rey no merece menos.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec03=Una elección magnífica.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec04=Sabia elección.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion01=¿Estáis preparados?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Siento que te cuesta controlar la oscuridad. No eres digno de ella.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Siento la oscuridad en ti, demonio. Menos que en otros, pero suficiente como para servirme.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Interesante. Estás al lado de un señor de la oscuridad, pero no muestras temor...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Hm. La oscuridad y la luz luchan en tu interior... Ninguna criatura puede servir a dos amos eternamente.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Un ser de oscuridad pura. Sirve al Imperio Eterno y vivirás.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Tu poder servirá al Imperio Eterno, demonio. Si te resistes, lo tomaremos por la fuerza.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Una criatura de la luz... El Imperio Eterno se ha enfrentado antes a criaturas como tú. Estaban deliciosas.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond00=Tu carencia de fe resulta molesta.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond01=La pregunta es: ¿lo estás tú?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond02=Preocúpate de lo que te concierne.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Murky00=Si eso es lo que deseas, no seré un obstáculo para tu cólera.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Negative00=Basta.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Positive00=Basta de cortesías... Hay mucho que hacer.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Sí, criatura de luz... Abraza el miedo para que la oscuridad pueda consumirte.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill00=Demasiado fácil.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill01=Te falta convicción.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill02=El imperio no tolera a los traidores.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill03=Una demostración insignificante.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill04=Considera este asunto concluido.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillArthas00=La muerte te rodea, pero no eres su amo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillAzmodan00=¿Por qué te rebelas, demonio? Deseamos lo mismo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillBarbarian00=¿Has pensado en llevar armadura?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillButcher00=Tanta rabia... Tanto odio. Me servirás, bestia.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillCrusader00=Me parece que te gusta demasiado hablar, cruzada.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDemonHunter00=Tú solo has adoptado la oscuridad, yo nací en ella.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDiablo00=Al Imperio Eterno le vendría bien tu poder, Diablo. Únete a mí.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillMonk00=Reza a cuantos dioses quieras. No pueden salvarte de mí.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillSpreeEnd00=Ni los mejores de entre vosotros dan la talla frente a mí.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillTyrael00=Qué curioso. ¿Un ángel? ¿O solo un ser de luz que finge serlo?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillUther00=Todos los que blandan la luz serán extinguidos.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWitchDoctor00=Juegas con poderes que escapan a tu comprensión.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWizard00=Tú... no eres ella... Pero tu muerte me complace igual.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal01=Ah, mi muerte ha sido pospuesta.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal02=Ha estado muy cerca... esta vez.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana00=Me queda poco maná.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana01=No, me falta maná para eso.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana02=Necesito maná.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No00=Es imposible.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No01=No me obligues a acabar contigo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No02=Nunca.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistHero00=Nuestro aliado fracasa.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe00=Conmigo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe01=¡A mí, rápido!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackCastle00=El núcleo, ¡eliminadlo!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackMerc00="Motivad" a esos mercenario para que se unan a nosotros.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Destrozad sus fortificaciones.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackTower00=Esa torre de vigilancia resultaría muy útil.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendCastle00=¡Defended nuestro núcleo!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendOutpost00=No permitáis que caiga este fuerte.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendTower00=Defended esta torre de vigilancia.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_KillHero00=Mostradle a este héroe el poder de la oscuridad.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed00=¿Qué pasa?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed01=Estás poniendo a prueba mi paciencia. Yo que tú no lo haría.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed02=El Imperio Eterno ha consumido muchos mundos. Su poder está vinculado a mí a través de la oscuridad.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed03=Bajo mi atenta mirada, hemos aplastado a todos nuestros enemigos menos a uno. ¿Por qué son tan fuertes esas princesas de las estrellas? Y no me digas que es por el poder del amor. Deja de decir eso, es estúpido.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed04=Déjalo ya, sabes que nunca has ido al Nexo en un barco.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed05=Entonces, tenemos un trato. No, espera ¡lo cambio! Ah, mucho mejor. Hm, esta parte se puede cambiar más... Sí, ¡SÍ! Este trato mejora por momentos.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed06=Nunca subestimes el poder de la oscuridad. En serio, no lo hagas. Se pone toda pasiva agresiva y se dedica a dejar notas pegadas por ahí.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed07=Si construyes un arma gigantesca y nada práctica, no escatimes en control de calidad. Pasar por alto el más mínimo detalle puede conducir al desastre.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed08=Siempre hay dos señores del espacio. Un maestro y un aprendiz. Nuestros encuentros son solitarios... y unilaterales.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed09=Sí, el poder de la oscuridad parece una especie de holograma fluorescente. ¿Y qué?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed10=<angry exertion> Este visor siempre se empaña. <SFX: Squeegee sounds> Ah, mucho mejor.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed11=Hay quien dice que el nombre de Imperio Eterno es presuntuoso. Bueno, de hecho, "hubo quien dijo" que era presuntuoso. Usemos el tiempo verbal adecuado para hablar de los muertos.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed12=No, las lucecitas brillantes no sirven para nada. Pero, si vas a ir por ahí con un cuerpo robótico, te puedes dar un capricho y tunearlo aquí y allá.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed13=No es una ópera espacial de verdad hasta que canta un alien gordo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed14=No te haces una idea de la cantidad de pilas que gasto al año.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed15=A la gente se le olvida mencionar lo aburrido que es el espacio: es grande, está prácticamente vacío y en las partes habitadas solo hay cretinos.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected00=Servicio infinito. Lealtad eterna.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected01=Bien hecho, sirviente del imperio.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive00=Ya se ha cerrado el círculo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive01=Soy eterno, al igual que nuestro imperio.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive02=Ah... Que continúe la inquisición.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive03=¿Creíais que os habíais librado de mí?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive04=No estoy muerto. No estoy vivo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec00=La oscuridad se hace más fuerte.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec01=Nuestros enemigos conocerán el verdadero sufrimiento.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec02=Hm. Adecuado.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec03=No me decepcionas.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec04=Bien, algo útil.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt00=Eres insignificante.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt01=Ven, enfréntate a tu destino.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt02=Me ocuparé de ti yo mismo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/TeamKilled00=¡Nooooo!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExLocked00=Será mejor que esta perturbación sea importante.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah, una presencia familiar...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Gift00=Como desees.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Lockin00=La galaxia sufrirá.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Purchase00=Gloria al Imperio Eterno.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial00=Ah, un nuevo mundo que someter.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial01=¿Quieres ver una muestra de mi poder? Permíteme.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked00=Únete a mí y juntos dominaremos la galaxia.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked01=Mi paciencia tiene sus límites.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased00=Para cuando tú te canses de esperar, yo seguiré sin inmutarme.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased01=Tantas estrellas... Con el tiempo todas acabarán a mi servicio.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used00=Nadie puede escapar a su destino.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used01=Ja, ya te tengo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used02=Bienvenidos a la arena del destino.

VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed01=¿Tienes algo que decir?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed02=Mi tío me lleva a unos sitios muy raros... ¡Ni siquiera sé dónde estamos ahora!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed03=¿Has estado en Cima del Trueno? Los tauren construyeron toda una ciudad hecha de tiendas sobre una meseta. ¿Sabes? Me pregunto cómo harán para... ya sabes...
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed04=Ten cuidado de no beber mucho brebaje curativo. Puede volverte estúpido. ¡Y gordo! ¡Ah, y vago!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed05=¿Sabes? ¡Lo mejor de explorar el Nexo es que veo un nuevo mundo cada veinte minutos más o menos!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed06=Pues... Nací en el caparazón de una tortuga gigante que, eh, viaja por el océano... Pero, ¿y si el océano fuese el caparazón de una tortuga más grande? Y... (emocionada) ¡Increíble! ¡¿Y si hubiese cada vez una tortuga más grande?!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed07=Me aburrooooo. ¡Quiero hacer algo!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed08=Entonces, ¿nadie más se pregunta de dónde vienen todos esos esbirros? O sea, ni siquiera hablan... ¿Holaaaaa? ¿Hola?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed09=¿Vas por ahí molestando a toda la gente que conoces? Porque es... SÚPER raro.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed10=Pones a esta panda muyyyy triste.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed11=¡La vida es una aventura! A menos que no lo sea... No estoy segura de qué es exactamente... ¡pero es algo! ¡Eso, eso! ¡La vida es algo!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed12=Eh... ¿No deberíamos estar luchando? A ver, hablar está bien, pero seguro que nuestro equipo nos espera, ¿no crees?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed13=A ver... ¿Alguna vez piensas moverte y explorar un poco? ¡Hay todo un mundo ahí fuera!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Resurrected00=Eh, gracias. ¡Necesitaba que me echaran un cable!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Resurrected01=¡Eres mi salvavidas!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Revive00=Vaya, estos tipos no juegan limpio.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Revive01=¿Qué clase de cobarde le pega a una niña?

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed03=Cuando pienso en la Tierra, me doy cuenta de lo mucho que echo de menos... todo. Hasta los insectos. Allí eran mucho más pequeños, ¿sabes?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed04=Oh, no, esto es lo de los toquecitos esos, ¿verdad? Piensa algo, rápido... Maldita sea, ¡soy doctora, no humorista!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed05=Cuando la gente me pregunta, siempre digo que curar es fácil. Es como matar, pero al revés.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed06=El médico es siempre el primer objetivo... de ahí el escudo enorme de regeneración de vida.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed07=Un momento, ¿atacar a un médico no era un crimen de guerra? ¿O es que los Convenios de Ginebra no tienen validez en el Nexo?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed08=Si has suministrado neuroestimulantes a una Supermente en ciernes, lo demás te parece suturar y cantar... créeme.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed09=Vale, el próximo que me pregunte "¿Qué me pasa, doctor?" va a saber de primera mano lo que es una negligencia médica.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed10=Ah, admito que odio las agujas... ¡pero clavárselas a otra persona es muy divertido!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed11=Regla número uno del juramento hipocrático: no dañarás. Si eso no funciona, ya se pasa a lo de lanzar granadas.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed12=A los soldados les encanta cotillear. Siempre están difundiendo rumores, como aquel de que usamos grapadoras para cerrar las heridas. Idiotas... yo uso una pistola de clavos. Es más barata.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed13=Debo admitir que me gusta el nuevo equipo... Espera, ¿no tengo bengala óptica? ¿De verdad? Uff... El lanzagranadas está bien, pero echo de menos cegar a la gente.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed14=Ah, aquí pone algo... "Este haz de sanación no cuenta con la aprobación de la FDA. Evite manejar maquinaria pesada o criaturas míticas tras usar la sanación".
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed15="Entre los efectos secundarios se incluyen náuseas, desplazamiento dimensional, irritación del estómago y secreciones conscientes. Antes de usar el haz de sanación, consulte con su médico".
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed16=Mmm... creo que debería limitarme a usar esta cosa en OTRA gente.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Resurrected00=Ah, por un momento he visto la luz...
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Resurrected01=Gracias, no sé qué haría sin ti.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive00=Pulso, constante. Signos vitales, estables.

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec03=Uno de cada un médicos lo recomienda.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec04=Ah, ¡ese me encanta!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt00=¡Vas a probar tu propia medicina!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt01=Espera, ¿crees que eres rival para nosotros?

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond01=No pongas en duda mis habilidades.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond02=Estoy dispuesto.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Si te burlas de un sacerdote de Rathma, atente a las consecuencias.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Ah, sí... Eso explica tu presencia. Muy bien.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Encantador.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Solo ha pasado mucho tiempo para ti...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Mmm... Nephalem... Así que las leyendas son ciertas. Esto se pone interesante.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Nunca me he juntado con demonios. No tengo intención de empezar ahora.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Ya... Una pena que tú no puedas. ¿Acaso has olvidado la última vez?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Guárdate la bilis para alguien a quien le importe.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=Bueno... La muerte siempre ha estado aquí.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Ah... ¿Un tanto infantil, no crees?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ese sonido es bastante espeluznante.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Esto solo se resolverá con acciones, no con palabras.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Vamos, mantendremos el equilibrio juntos.

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill05=¡Ja! Tengo tu oreja...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillArthas00=No eres más que un niño, disfrazado de dios de la muerte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillAzmodan00=Pff. Duriel fue más duro que tú... y era un gusano gigante.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillD3Hero00=Y ni siquiera soy un nephalem.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDeath00=Bueno, un "maestro de la muerte" menos abarrotando el Nexo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDemon00=Mantendré el equilibrio, demonio.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDiablo00=¡Señor Diablo, te he vencido!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillLeoric00=No necesito a un no-muerto que no me obedece.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillMephisto00=Buen viaje, Mefisto. Dale recuerdos al abismo de mi parte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Controlo el poder de la muerte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillTyrael00=Mis disculpas, ángel. Pero los que perturben el equilibrio caerán.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillUndead00=Vaya desperdicio de carne.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillWitchDoctor00=Los muertos deben servirnos, médico brujo. No nosotros a ellos.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillZeratul00=Tienes razón... las guadañas son lo MÁS.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ah, mucho mejor que esas pociones nauseabundas.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal01=El toque helado de la muerte se disipa.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal02=Buena sanación...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana00=Necesito... maná.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana01=No tengo maná.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana02=Ojalá tuviese una poción de maná.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No00=Ja. No.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No01=No puedo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No02=Imposible.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No03=¿Qué sentido tendría?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Nuestro aliado está en peligro.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe00=¡Necesito ayuda!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe01=¡Ayudadme!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=¡Destruid su núcleo!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Capturemos este campamento de mercenarios.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Derribad esta fortaleza.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Mmm... Esta torre de vigilancia nos sería útil.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=¡Defended nuestro núcleo!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Defended nuestro fuerte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendTower00=¡Que no tomen esta torre de vigilancia!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_KillHero00=La muerte llama a este héroe.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed00=¿Qué deseas?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed01=¿Es esto necesario?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed02=¿Mmm? Sí, la guadaña también es nueva para mí, pero debo admitir que empieza a gustarme.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed03=Solo hay dos cosas de las que no se puede escapar: la muerte y... mmm. ¿Sabes qué? No recuerdo cuál era la otra... Bueno, me vale la muerte dos veces.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed04=Pero, pero... La muerte te domina...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed05=Los sacerdotes de Rathma tenemos la misión de mantener el equilibrio, pero parece que muchos no entienden lo que es.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed06=Imagina el equilibrio como una red... una red de protección invisible que evita que tu insignificancia acabe consumida por la nada. Mi tarea es mantener esa red. ¡Dame las gracias!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed07=Al líder de los nigromantes se le conoce como el Portavoz de la muerte. Adivina cuál es su tema de conversación favorito...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed08=En mi época, nadie te creería si le dijeses que los nephalem son de verdad... ¡y mira, aquí hay seis de ellos! Un poco excesivo, ¿no crees?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed09=¿Crees que esto es difícil? ¡Ja! Ni siquiera estás jugando en incondicional.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed10=Se recoge lo que se siembra... y yo siembro las semillas de la muerte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed11=Sí, traigo a la gente de vuelta de entre los muertos, pero no es algo bonito.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed12=Por última vez: los nigromantes no sienten atracción por los muertos. Esos son los necro... ¿Sabes qué? Déjalo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed13=Algún día tendré que hacer algo con todas las orejas que he ido coleccionando. Igual puedo hacerme un cinturón o algo así.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed14=¿Traed vuestros muertos? Pues ya que lo dices...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed15=Mantener el equilibrio es difícil, pero con subir un poco las estadísticas de un ángel por aquí y bajar las de un demonio por allá, listo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected00=Regreso... pero no como cadáver. Tienes que enseñarme cómo se hace.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected01=¿Una resurrección verdadera? Debería ser imposible...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive00=De modo que así es la muerte... Ya la echo de menos.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive01=El gran ciclo del ser comienza de nuevo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive02=Parece que aún quedan cosas por hacer.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive03=Me gusta no tener que volver hasta mi cadáver.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec00=Interesante...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec01=Seguro que lo disfrutaré.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec02=Como debe ser.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec03=Sabes lo que haces...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec04=Ah. Yo también le había echado el ojo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt00=Tienes... una cita con la muerte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt01=Haces bien en temerme, pero no creas que eso te salvará.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt02=Siento... vida... en ti. Permíteme que te libre de ella.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/TeamKilled00=No dejéis que la muerte os derrote. Usadla para vengaros.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExLocked00=La muerte me obedece.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah... Un rostro familiar.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Gift00=Cuánta generosidad.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Lockin00=Es la hora.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Purchase00=De nuevo en acción.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial00=Esto ya es otra cosa.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial01=¿Toca practicar, supongo?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked00=¿Qué tal si salimos de aquí?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Vamos, prueba mis habilidades... Ardo en deseos de volver al campo de batalla.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Debería haber venido más abrigado.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Mmm. Battle.net tiene mucha mejor pinta que antes.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used00=¡Nova de veneno!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used01=¡Corrupción fétida!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used02=El aliento pútrido de los inertes.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used03=Sentid la esencia nociva.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used00=Sentid el frío de la muerte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used01=La mano de la muerte se acerca.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used02=¡Alzaos y servidme!

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Healed00=Justo a tiempo.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Healed01=¡Sigue curando así!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Healed02=Una curación experta.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroAgree00=¡Masacraremos a esos patanes o moriremos en el intento!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroAgree01=¡Ja! ¡Ese es el espíritu!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroAgree02=¡Aprovechad vuestros talentos y la victoria será nuestra!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroBoast00=¡No tienen ninguna posibilidad contra nosotros!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroBoast01=¡Victoria o muerte! ¡Es la única alternativa!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroQuestion00=¿Listos para entrar en la arena?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroQuestion01=¿Estáis preparados para derramar sangre?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=¿Me han puesto un múrloc en el equipo? ¿Qué clase de broma es esta?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Genial... Tenías que ser tú.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=¡Lok'tar, camarada!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Es un honor luchar junto a mi Jefe de Guerra.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=¡Pero si es el rey cebo de crocolisco! Espero que el lujo de la corte no te haya ablandado.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroRespond00=Hace años que no disfruto de una buena lucha.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroRespond01=¡De vuelta a la arena!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroRespond02=Los espíritus nos concederán la victoria.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Bueno, al menos tienes un espíritu combativo.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Sí. Ahora acéptalo o calla. Tú eliges.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=¡Venga, tenemos una batalla que ganar! ¡Por la Horda!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=El honor es mío, Jefe de Guerra.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=El tiempo lo cambia todo, cebo de crocolisco. A mí también.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill00=¡Ja! ¡Todavía se me da bien!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill01=No te levantes. Te irá mejor.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill02=Le has hecho perder dinero a alguien.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill03=Debes entrenarte mucho más.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill04=Dime que puedes hacerlo mejor.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillBarbarian00=¡Por fin una pelea digna!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillHuman00=Ni de lejos, paliducho.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillMalfurion00=Todos los druidas son iguales.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillMarine00=Qué desperdicio de armadura.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Otra racha de victorias truncada...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillThrall00=Ha sido un honor, Jefe de Guerra.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillVarian00=¡Je! ¡Buen intento, cebo de crocolisco!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillZerg00=Letal e incansable, ¡como a mí me gustan los enemigos!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Laugh00=<risa>
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ha estado cerca... Gracias.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowLifeHeal01=Estás demostrando tu valía.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowLifeHeal02=Te debo la vida.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowMana00=Me queda poco maná.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowMana01=Me falta maná.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowMana02=Necesito más maná.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/No01=¿Estás de broma?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/No02=No me hagas perder el tiempo.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Un compañero necesita ayuda.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Que alguien venga a ayudarme.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AssistMe01=No puedo hacer esto solo.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=¡Destruid el núcleo enemigo!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=¡Estos mercenarios nos ayudarán o morirán!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=¡Hay que destruir este fuerte!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AttackTower00=¡Tomad esa torre de vigilancia!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defended el núcleo con vuestra vida.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=¡Defended este fuerte! ¡Ya!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Hay que defender esta torre de vigilancia.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_KillHero00=Eliminad a ese héroe del combate.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed00=¿Sí?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed01=¿Qué quieres de mí?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed02=Mi vida es como la de todos los orcos: una historia de salvajismo y redención. Algún día te la contaré.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed03=Cuidado, novato.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed04=Te he dicho que no me toques. No soy ese tipo de orco.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed05=Mi animal espiritual es el lobo. ¿No es evidente?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed06=Los mortales solo somos sombras y ceniza...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed07=¿Muln Furiatierra? No, no estoy emparentado con ese viejo buey. Aunque es verdad que mi abuela daba unas coces...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed08=¿Sabes? Años haciendo bandas, y nunca me ha caído el yelmo de este conjunto.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed09=Se dice que solo un chamán puede saber el equilibrio y el peso de su tótem.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed10=Piénsalo: una expansión de World of Warcraft sobre los chamanes. Se llamaría... "World of Shamcraft". ¡Se vende sola!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed11=Agh, ¿quién huele a perro mojado? Ah, vale...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed12=¿Cómo? ¡Yo no llevo falda! Esto son quijotes, en serio. Si no me crees, búscalos en Wowhead.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed13=¡Trueno! ¡Relámpagos! Uy, qué susto.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed14=No se lo digas a nadie, pero a veces me convierto en lobo fantasmal solo para hacer /bailar.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed15=Te propongo una cosa: si paras ahora, nos dividimos mis ganancias 60/40, a mi favor.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed16=Esto de los videojuegos no está mal. Debería probarlo más a menudo.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed17=Héroe de la tormenta, ¿eh? Creo que en esto juego con ventaja...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Resurrected00=¡Vuelvo al combate!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Resurrected01=Gracias por la resurrección en combate.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Revive00=¡Los espíritus me convocan para la batalla!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Revive01=¡Aún puedo luchar otra ronda!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Revive02=Siempre escuece un poco...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec00=¡Mi poder aumenta!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec01=Eso equilibrará la balanza.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec02=Me gusta tu forma de pensar.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec03=Eso no se lo esperarán.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec04=Los ancestros me bendicen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt00=¡Los más listos apuestan por mí, mequetrefe!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt01=¿Crees que sobrevivirás a un combate conmigo? Ya veremos.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt02=¿Otro enclenque? Venga, acabemos con esto.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/TeamKilled00=¡Centraos! Todavía podemos ganar.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_ExLocked00=¡Mok'ra!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Que los ancestros te protejan.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Gift00=¿Un nuevo compañero? Espero que sepa luchar.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Lockin00=¡Lucharé hasta mi último aliento!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Purchase00=¡De vuelta al combate!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Trial00=Escucha bien al viejo Rehgar y a lo mejor aprendes algo.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Trial01=Abre bien los ojos. Solo te lo enseñaré una vez.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Vale, esto se está haciendo aburrido. MUY aburrido.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Odio quedarme de brazos cruzados.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=¿Cómo se las arregla Thrall para estar tanto tiempo de pie?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=¿Sabes que podríamos estar luchando ahora mismo?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate1Used00=¡Contemplad el poder de la Horda!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate1Used01=¡Sentid la furia en vuestra sangre!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate2Used00=¡Que los ancestros os protejan!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate2Used01=¡Que los espíritus os salven!

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes06=Enseguida.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes07=Puedes apostar a que sí.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes08=Vamos.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Attack00=¡Son vulnerables! ¡Acabad con ellos!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Attack01=Hay que atacar ahora que son vulnerables.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Attack02=¡Al ataque!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Caution00=Cuidado, nos acecha el peligro.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_GoodJob00=Buen golpe.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_GoodJob01=¡Ja! Bien hecho.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_GoodJob02=Trabajamos bien juntos.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Heal00=Tus heridas son profundas. Ve a curarte.

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Retreat00=Debo retirarme.

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroAgree00=Va a ser divertido...
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroAgree01=Mmm, estoy de acuerdo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroAgree02=Mi hacha es tuya.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroBoast00=Cazad como uno solo y venceremos.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroBoast01=¡Que comience la caza!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion00=¿Estáis listos para que comience la caza?

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Estás un poco lejos de las Islas del Eco, ¿no crees?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Mmm. Tú.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Ah, me alegro de volver a verte, camarada.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Samuro00=Ah, ¡maestro de las espadas! Ha pasado mucho tiempo...
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Jefe de Guerra. Qué gran honor.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroRespond00=Por supuesto.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroRespond01=Mmm. Ven, Misha.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroRespond02=Mis acciones hablan por mí.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=¡Silencio! ¡O mi osa te convertirá en su cena!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Trabajar con demonios... ¡qué mundo más extraño!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Chen00=Y que lo digas, Chen. Venga, cacemos juntos una vez más.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_DemonHunter00=Por fin, alguien más con experiencia en la caza.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=<Scoff> Lo que tú digas.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Gazlowe00=Pasé unos años perdido por Desolace, pero, aparte de eso, no me puedo quejar.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=¡Por la Horda!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Mmm, centrémonos en la batalla que nos espera.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Mmm, este tiene agallas. Interesante.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Es por esto que prefiero la compañía de las bestias.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=Ah, tú... otra vez.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Normalmente prefiero trabajar con bestias, pero puedo hacer una excepción.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Samuro00=Me alegra ver que estás bien, hermano.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Jefe de Guerra... Es un placer luchar a tu lado una vez más.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Tired00=Uff, me estoy cansando de esto.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill00=Solo podía acabar de una manera.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill01=Un buen combate.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill02=¡Zas! ¡En toda la boca!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill03=Las bestias se alimentarán de tus restos.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill04=Misha, ¡a saber dónde ha estado eso antes!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillButcher00=Mira quién ha terminado hecho picadillo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillChen00=Te has esforzado, Chen. Pero no lo suficiente.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillChogall00=Es por debiluchos como tú que los ogros tienen mala reputación.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillDemonHunter00=Deberías dejar de ser la presa, cazadora.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillHorde00=Descansa en paz, héroe de la Horda.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillJaina00=Mmm, no eres la primera de los Valiente en caer.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Simple.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillThrall00=Perdóname, Jefe de Guerra.

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowLifeHeal02=Mucho mejor.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana00=Me quedo sin maná.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana01=No tengo suficiente maná.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana02=Me falta maná.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel00=Misha, ¡a mí!

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No00=No puedo hacerlo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No01=Pides lo imposible.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No02=No puedo hacer eso.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Nuestro aliado necesita ayuda.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Necesito ayuda.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Guerreros a mí, ¡rápido!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=¡Destruid su núcleo!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Vamos a "reclutar" a algunos mercenarios.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Deberíamos atacar este fuerte.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Sería prudente capturar su torre de vigilancia.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=¡Defended el núcleo! ¡Rápido!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Debemos defender este fuerte.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendTower00=¡Defended esta torre de vigilancia!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_KillHero00=Matad a este héroe.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed00=Listo para rastrear.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed01=Mi presa se acerca.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed02=Los animales son mi única familia. Bueno, mi padre... No, los animales son mi única familia.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed03=Hay quienes creen que no hay mayor desafío que cazar con un arco... Deberían intentarlo con un hacha.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed04=Me río en la cara del peligro.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed05=Que quede claro: todo el botín que consigamos es mío. Lo necesito. Son... cosas de cazadores.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed06=No todos los Mok'Nathal somos medio ogros. Yo solo tengo un cuarto de ogro... como mucho.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed07=Uff, no puedo aguantar tanto trote... Ay, eres más pesado que una vaca en brazos. ¡Vete a freír monas! Gorrino.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed08=Estos jóvenes... No, la máscara no representa un murciélago, sino un lobo. Uno oscuro.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed09=¿Yo? ¿Perdido? Por favor, conozco Desolace como la palma de mi... ¿Eh? ¿Qué es eso?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed10=Cuando estoy defendiendo el Bastión Señor del Trueno de esa escoria de la Alianza, necesito todas mis fuerzas. Para eso, no hay nada como desayunar un gran tazón de Talbukao: el desayuno de los campeones... de la Horda.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed11=¿Eh? Ah, lo que yo haga en mi tiempo libre es cosa mía.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed12=Ah, me encanta esta parte.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed13=Por cierto, ¿sabes todas las veces que te ha derrotado un cazador? Era yo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed14=Vale, se acabó el descanso... Hora de volver a esto de Heroes of the Storm.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Resurrected00=Gracias. A partir de ahora, yo me encargo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Resurrected01=Justo a tiempo, camarada.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive00=Recupero mi fuerza.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive01=Oigo la llamada de lo salvaje.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive02=¡Que comience la caza!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec00=Con esto bastará.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec01=Muy astuto.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec02=Sabia elección.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec03=Muy bien.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec04=¡Lok'tar ogar!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt00=¡Yo te daré caza!

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt02=¡No intentes huir!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/TeamKilled00=No dejéis que dobleguen vuestro espíritu. Ese es su objetivo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_ExLocked00=Fuerza y honor.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_ExPurchased00=¡Larga vida a Thrall!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Gift00=El lugar en el que reposo mi cabeza es mi hogar.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Lockin00=Oigo la llamada de lo salvaje.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Purchase00=Vamos, Misha. Comienza la caza.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Trial00=¿Una prueba de fuerza? Entiendo...
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Trial01=Superaré todas tus expectativas, te lo aseguro.

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed13=El golpe que mató a Orgrim marcó para siempre la parte trasera de su armadura. Sirve como recordatorio de que el enemigo puede golpear donde menos te lo esperas.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed14=Espera, espera, espera... A ver si te sabes esta: ¿cuántos orcos hacen falta para cambiar una bombilla? Cinco: uno que la sujete y cuatro que giren la habitación.

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Kill02=¡Acepta tu final!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Kill03=Que la diosa te lleve.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Kill04=Ve en paz.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillDemon00=Estas tierras están bajo mi protección, demonio.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillFairyDragon00=Me apena matar a un hijo de Ysera.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillIllidan00=Illidan... Espero que ahora encuentres la paz.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillKaelthas00=Eres una deshonra para la familia Caminante del Sol.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillMalfurion00=Perdóname, mi amor.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillSiegeTank00=Ni los gnomos construirían una abominación semejante.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillSpreeEnd00=Este es el castigo por tus crímenes.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillSylvanas00=Practica otros mil años y a lo mejor llegas a estar a mi altura.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowLifeHeal00=Me has salvado la vida.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowLifeHeal01=Siempre estaré en deuda contigo.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowLifeHeal02=Has disipado la oscuridad. Gracias.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowMana00=Me queda poco maná.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowMana01=Me queda poco maná.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowMana02=Necesito más maná.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/No00=No puedo hacer eso.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/No01=Me pides lo imposible.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/No02=No puede ser.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AssistHero00=¡Nuestro aliado necesita ayuda!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AssistMe00=Necesito ayuda.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AssistMe01=¡A mí, rápido!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AttackCastle00=¡Ataquemos el núcleo del enemigo!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AttackMerc00=Vamos a capturar este campamento de mercenarios.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AttackOutpost00=¡Este fuerte debe caer!

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed00=La diosa llama.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed01=Anu'therador mali.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed02=No creas que por ser sacerdotisa mi furia se ha apagado.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed03=Ponte una manzana en... ¡la cabeza! Perfecto. ¡Hace tiempo que no uso este arco!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed04=Este es mi búho. Hay muchos como él, pero este revela enemigos.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed05=La semana que viene cumplo 29 años. Por milésima vez.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed06=¿Alguien ha visto a mi gata? Tengo la impresión de que hace años que no la veo. ¡Gatita! ¡Gatita!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed07=No es por nada, pero cuando las mujeres gobernamos Kalimdor, vivimos una era de paz. Entonces se despertaron los hombres y ahora tenemos guerras todos los años.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed08=Hola, me llamo Tyrande y esta es la hermana Shandris. ¿Tienes un momento para hablar sobre Elune? Toma, un folleto. Eh... ¿Hola?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed09=¿Pero qué...? ¿Cuánto llevan estas hojas en mi pelo? ¿Por qué no me ha avisado nadie?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed10=Soy la suma sacerdotisa Tyrande, campeona de la justicia. En el nombre de Elune, ¡te castigaré!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed11=Diosa, hazme rápida y certera. Afina mi puntería, y si hoy es el día que eliges para llevarme a tu lado, deja que muera con la aljaba vacía.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed12=Echo de menos tener un milenio o dos para mí sola.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed13=Malfurion y yo tenemos una norma en nuestra relación: nada de cambios de forma. Por ahí no paso.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed14=Buenas noches, bosque. Buenas noches, tortuga. Buenas noches, elfos. Buenas noches, Plumaluna, y buenas noches, Elune.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Resurrected00=Queda mucho por hacer.

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec03=Una gran bendición.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec04=Me será de ayuda.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt00=Que la diosa te muestre piedad. Yo no lo haré.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt01=Te arrepentirás de tu insolencia.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt02=Si crees que me das miedo, siento decepcionarte.

VoiceOver/Uther/AI_GoodJob02=Una muestra de valentía.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Heal00=No tienes buen aspecto. Bebe de una fuente.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Heal01=Yo que tú buscaría una fuente de sanación.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Retreat00=Debo retirarme.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Retreat01=Me retiro... por ahora.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh00=Una pena.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh01=Por la Luz...
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh02=No desesperéis.
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack00=¡Por Lordaeron!

VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=Siempre me enorgullece servir junto a otros soldados de la Alianza.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=¿Por qué debería fiarme de ti, chico?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Supongo que tú eres esa "cruzada" de la que tanto he oído hablar.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Greymane00=El mismísimo Genn Cringrís. Ya era hora de que Gilneas volviese a la batalla.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Oh. La Horda... Con lo bien que pintaba el día.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Impressed00=Vaya, parece que tienes cierta experiencia en la batalla.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Lady Jaina, es un placer volver a luchar contigo.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Conque Rey Esqueleto, ¿no? El nombre te viene al pelo.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Light00=<Do not record. Reuses Pissed01>
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_LightVictory00=<Do not record. Reuses Boast00>
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Medic00=¡Ja! ¡Te saludo, camarada combatiente!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Murky00=¿Eres un múrloc? ¿Qué haces aquí?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=¿Un nigromante? No me emocionan los de tu clase.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Aquí estás...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Positive00=¡Saludos! ¿Qué me dices? ¿Vamos a repartir justicia?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Stitches00=¡Por la Luz! ¿Qué clase de abominación eres tú?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=¿Sylvanas? Da pena verte.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Varian, la última vez que te vi eras un crío.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=¿Soy yo, o los zerg os volvéis cada vez más raros?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zuljin00=Así que este es el poderoso Zul'jin. Mentiría si dijese que estoy impresionado.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond00=Siempre.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond01=Será un placer.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond02=¡Por la Luz!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Alliance00=¡Gloria a la Alianza!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Angry00=Eso te ha costado una sanación. Justo cuando más la necesites.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Arthas00=No me obligues a callarte de un puñetazo.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Me has dejado sordo...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Cranky00=En mis tiempos, respetábamos a los mayores. ¡ESPECIALMENTE cuando curaban!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Por favor... Yo blandía la Luz cuando aún gateabas.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Vale, nos ha quedado claro: te gusta provocar. Felicidades, ¿pasamos a otra cosa?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Excited00=¡Ja! Esto pasará a la posteridad.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Greymane00=Ja, ja, me alegro de oírlo, perro viejo. Esto... perdona.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Horde00=Añadir "nueva" al nombre de la Horda no os absuelve de vuestros pecados, ¿sabes?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Impressed00=Vale, veamos cómo te las gastas.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Jaina00=La culpa forma parte de mí, y viviré con ella hasta que muera.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Leoric00=No me extraña que los tuyos te matasen.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Medic00=Eh... ¿Qué parte? ¿Las hombreras de águila gigantes? ¿O mi martillo mágico de primeros auxilios?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Mocking00=¿Qué clase de héroe eres tú? Me he limpiado barro de las botas que tenía más heroísmo.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Murky00=¿Podrías repetirme eso?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=¿Luz y oscuridad combatiendo juntas? Vamos a ver qué sale de esto...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Negative00=Cállate, ¿quieres? Tenemos una batalla que ganar.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NewRace00=¿Eres de Azeroth? Te vas unos años del planeta y todo se vuelve una locura.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NightElf00=Y yo que pensaba que los elfos nobles se lo tenían creído.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Positive00=¡Ja! Ahora verán de qué somos capaces.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Stitches00=No voy a enaltecerte con una respuesta.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Y yo pensaba que los muertos eran MENOS agresivos.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Uncaring00=Oh, ¿debería importarme lo que dices? Ja. Esta sí que es buena.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Varian00=¡Por la Alianza!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Espero que recuerdes en qué bando estás, bichejo.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zuljin00=Sí. Ese es el tipo de comentarios que esperaría de un trol.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill00=Hemos impartido justicia.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill01=Ve hacia la Luz.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill02=Este es tu final.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill03=Así debía ser.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill04=¡Ni siquiera te esfuerzas!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAlliance00=Te pido disculpas, camarada.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAngel00=Mmm, ¡creo que he matado a un ángel de la resurrección!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillArthas00=Púdrete en el infierno, chico.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillChogall00=Parece que los paladines y los magi ogros no están a la misma altura.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillCrusader00=Vaya... ¿Qué ha pasado con toda esa clase que tenías?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDemon00=¡De vuelta al Vacío! ¡O de donde sea que vengas!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDiablo00=¡Los de tu calaña no arruinarán el mundo, demonio!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillGuldan00=Hasta la "oscuridad personificada" palidece ante la Luz.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillHorde00=Una nueva Horda... con el mismo olor.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillJaina00=Qué mala suerte...
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKaelthas00=Aún tienes mucho que aprender, Kael'thas.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKerrigan00=La justicia viene a por ti, Kerrigan.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillMedivh00=Que mi martillo de guerra acabe aquello que empezó la espada de Lothar.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillPaladin00=Que la Luz se apiade de mi alma.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillRaynor00=Parece que necesitas entrenarte más, Raynor.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillScourge00=Mientras viva, Lordaeron nunca caerá ante tu mísera Plaga.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillSpreeEnd00=Buen intento.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillVarian00=¿Cuál era mi frase?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillWar200=Ah, qué recuerdos.
VoiceOver/Uther/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal00=Menos mal que has venido.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal01=Te debo la vida.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal02=Eternamente agradecido.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana00=Me queda poco maná.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana01=Se me acaba el maná.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana02=Me estoy quedando sin maná.
VoiceOver/Uther/No00=No.
VoiceOver/Uther/No01=Imposible.
VoiceOver/Uther/No02=No puedo.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistHero00=Nuestro aliado nos necesita.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe00=Necesito apoyo.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe01=¿Hay alguien ahí?
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackCastle00=¡Atacad el núcleo del enemigo!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackMerc00=Debemos capturar este campamento.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackOutpost00=¡A por el fuerte!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackTower00=Capturemos esta torre de vigilancia.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendCastle00=¡Defended nuestro núcleo!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendOutpost00=¡Defended nuestro fuerte!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendTower00=Debemos defender nuestra torre de vigilancia.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_KillHero00=Debemos derrotar a este enemigo.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed00=La bendición de la Luz nos protege.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed01=La Luz nos ilumina a todos.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed02=Soy demasiado viejo para este disparate.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed03=A veces, la luz del final del túnel es un tren.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed04=Hoy soy Uther el Cabreado.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed05=¿Pero qué...? ¿Dónde está esa mano de plata que había en el cielo?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed06=Nuestra orden se iba a llamar "Marrano de Plata", pero no era lo bastante épico.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed07=En mis tiempos solo había un tipo de paladín, y nos alegrábamos de tenerlo.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed08=Y solo podíamos subir hasta el nivel 10. ¿Por qué nivel vais ahora? ¿100? ¿Más? Estos jóvenes de hoy en día...
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed09=Sa... Luz.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed10=¿Puedes hacer lo mismo pero un poquito más hacia la izquierda?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed11=Aaah, eso está mejor.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed12=Los justos conocerán la paz, y los pérfidos, el sabor de mis nudillos.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed13=Mi iglesia es el campo de batalla. ¿Qué te crees que es este libro que llevo encima? ¿Un manual?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed14=Por cierto, un dragón de bronce me ha contado lo que los elfos de sangre harán con mi tumba... Y no me parece bien.
VoiceOver/Uther/Resurrected00=Me alegra que seamos aliados.
VoiceOver/Uther/Resurrected01=Gracias por resucitarme.
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive00=¡Por la Alianza!
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive01=Ha llegado la hora de la justicia.
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive02=Bueno, intentémoslo de nuevo.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec00=Una sabia decisión.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec01=La fe es mi recompensa.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec02=Le daré un buen uso.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec03=Excelente elección.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec04=Lo que haga falta.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt00=Veamos de qué eres capaz.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt01=La cobardía no es una virtud.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt02=¡No tienes agallas!
VoiceOver/Uther/TeamKilled00=Soy demasiado viejo para esto...
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_ExLocked00=Saludos.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_ExPurchased00=A tu disposición.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Gift00=¿Otro frente de guerra? Cuenta conmigo.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Lockin00=La Luz no abandona a nadie.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Purchase00=¡Por Lordaeron!
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Trial00=Verás lo que es un paladín de verdad.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Trial01=La Luz no entiende de pruebas.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitLocked00=Soy el martillo de la justicia.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitLocked01=Los paladines son el alma de la Alianza. Seguro que necesitas mi maestría.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ya no soy el mozalbete que era antes. ¿Puedes aligerar?
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitPurchased01=El tiempo no espera. Y dentro de un minuto, yo tampoco.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ultimate1Used00=¡Sin miedo! ¡La Luz está con nosotros!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ultimate1Used01=¡La Luz es nuestro escudo!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ultimate2Used00=¡La Luz lo conquista todo!

VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Deckard00=¡Caín! Dichosos los ojos.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=¿Estamos en el mismo bando? ¿Qué sinsentido es este?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_LordofHell00=Cuando termine, todavía me quedará energía para enfrentarme a ti.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_MagicUser00=¡Nunca creí que vería a alguien usar hechizos tan antiguos!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=¿El Ángel de la Muerte? ¿Aquí?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=¿Qué clase de monstruo eres? ¿Tienes afijos?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Un nigromante… ¿Conoces a Mehtan?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=¿Lucho en el mismo equipo que tú? Ver para creer…
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Esta batalla será espectacular. ¡Lo presiento!

VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=¿Hay algún sitio en el que puedas NO hablarme?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Mmm, sí, lo que tú digas.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=(sarcástica) Tu elocuencia me ha dejado pasmada.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Puedo asegurarte que más listos, no.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=¿Cómo iba a saber que era tan importante?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=(suspiro) ¿De veras hay que hacer esto?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=¿Has tenido que buscar esas palabras en el diccionario?

VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_MagicUser00=Presta atención y tal vez aprendas algo de mí.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=Espero que alguien te corte las alas.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Si no eres capaz de decir algo inteligente, mejor no abras la boca.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Soy una maga, no una hechicera. Tú eres el que parece perturbado.

VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=No sabes cuánto me alivia ver que no tengo que hacerlo todo…

VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiablo00=Esa por Leah.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiabloHero00=Mmm… ¿Eras alguien importante?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillJaina00=Lo cortés no quita lo valiente, maga.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillKaelthas00=Tu especie no es rival para mi magia…
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillLeoric00=¿Cuántas veces tengo que matarte?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMalthael00=Esta segunda vez no me ha costado nada matarte.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMedivh00=El duelo de magos se acabó. Has perdido.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillNephalem00=No era mi intención hacerlo… ¡Lo juro!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillSpreeEnd00=(risa) Me lo he pasado bomba.

VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana01=No tengo suficiente maná.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana02=Necesito más maná.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No00=¿Por qué iba a hacer eso?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No01=Ni hablar.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No02=No pienso hacerlo.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Alguien nos necesita.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe00=¿Me echáis una mano?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Necesito… ayuda.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=¡Es hora de atacar el núcleo!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Estos mercenarios deben ser nuestros.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=¡Este fuerte debe caer!

VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed00=Cumpliré mi destino.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed01=Siempre he tenido un don para la magia.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed02=Sí, yo soy la maga que destruyó el Sagrario de los Yshari… pero porque no tuve elección.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed03=¿Hay alguien ahí? Venga, salid. ¿No queréis jugar conmigo?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed04=He estudiado los secretos ancestrales de la magia… ¿para que vengas a molestarme? Pf.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed05=(amenazadora) Qué buen momento para practicar mi hechizo silenciador...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed06=¡A ver cómo te sientes ahora! <SFX: Magic casting sound>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed07=(Murmullos apagados de confusión cuando la maga se da cuenta de que se ha silenciado a sí misma)
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed08=<SFX: Magic casting sound> Ejem, es la... primera vez que cometo un error así.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed09=Como se lo cuentes a alguien, te envío a otro plano existencial.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed10=Mis profesores siempre me decían que debía ser más humilde. ¡Pero si soy la persona más humilde del universo! <carcajada>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed11=Qué gracioso que Eirena se equipe "focos" para lanzar hechizos, ¿no? Seguro que es porque le falta… <ejem> enfoque en la vida.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed12=Una vez lancé un misil mágico al vacío… y aún me guarda rencor por ello.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed13=¡La magia de esta magnánima maga es magistral!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed14=Isendra fue una gran maestra, pero siempre tuvo secretos. Aún no sé cómo se las ideó para teletransportarse tan rápido… ¡Y sin tiempo de reutilización!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed15=Se está mejor en casa que en ningún sitio.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected00=¡Me encanta cómo sanas!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected01=¡Eres mejor que un sacerdote Zakarum!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive00=Parece que hoy no me toca morir.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive01=Vaya… Esa no era mi intención…
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive02=Debería ir con más cuidado... O no.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec00=Mi poder aumenta.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec01=Sublime.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec02=Si me vieran aquellos viejos maestros...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec03=Mi sabiduría aumenta.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec04=Me vuelvo más poderosa.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt00=Espero que tengas testamento.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt01=¿Tienes prisa por morir?

VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial00=¿Quieres una demostración? (risa)
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial01=Con la magia no se juega, pero, por una vez, no pasa nada…
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Solo di las palabras mágicas.
