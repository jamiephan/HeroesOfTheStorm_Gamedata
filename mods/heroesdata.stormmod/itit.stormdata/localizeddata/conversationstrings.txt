Conversation/CreepVO/Line00068=Chi riuscirà a ottenerlo?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00069=Credo che mi dobbiate qualche sorta di tributo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00070=Vi conviene darvi da fare.

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00074=Chi otterrà il mio favore?

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00077=Vediamo chi riesce a impadronirsene.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00078=Conquistate il tributo! Devo averlo!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00079=Se volete la mia benedizione, vi conviene sbrigarvi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00080=Vi siete guadagnati il mio favore, eroi! Che il vostro nemico conosca la mia ira!

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00083=Inaccettabile. Ora conoscerete la mia maledizione!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00084=Basta! La maledizione è finita. Spero che ne abbiate approfittato.

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00104=Penso che ne abbiano avute abbastanza! Ah ah!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00105=Uh, è tutto pagato? Bah, chi se ne frega! Pensiamo a spassarcela!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00106=Affare fatto! Diamo ai vostri nemici una bella ripassata!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00107=A quanto pare il nemico vi ha battuto! Che vi serva di lezione!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00108=Il nemico ce l'ha con voi! Ah ah!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00109=Pare che il vostro nemico abbia già saldato! Sparate, pendagli da forca!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00110=Cacciate fuori i dobloni e forse punterò i cannoni sui vostri nemici!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00111=Vogliamo vedere chi conquista il tributo stavolta?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00112=Recuperate il tributo, o subite la mia maledizione. La scelta è semplice.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00113=Che tedio le vostre futili scaramucce. Pagate il tributo! Ottenete il mio favore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00114=Continuate a sparare! È tutto pagato!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00115=I dobloni bastano per un'altra scarica!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00116=(laugh) Questi marinai d'acqua dolce mi stanno facendo ricco! Fuoco!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00117=Sembra che i vostri nemici abbiano modificato l'accordo! Ah ah!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00118=Il vento sta girando a favore del vostro nemico!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00119=I miei cannoni costano. E i vostri nemici pagano profumatamente!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00120=Non è la vostra giornata? Peccato! Sparate!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00121=È ora di un'altra salva!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00122=Spero che ne vogliate ancora! Ah ah!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00123=Arr! Il vento sta girando a vostro favore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00124=Bene, bene, bene... I miei cannoni sono vostri!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00125=Puntate i cannoni sui loro nemici! Diamogli quello per cui hanno pagato!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00183=Rendiamo le cose interessanti! Dobloni a chiunque apra questo forziere.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00184=Sapete una cosa? Tesori per tutti! Ma soprattutto per me!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00185=Pensate di poter aprire tutti e due i forzieri, marinai d'acqua dolce?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00186=A che serve un pirata senza un piccolo tesoro?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00187=Saltiamo la caccia al tesoro. Eccolo lì. Andate a prenderlo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00188=Vediamo come ve la cavate con due forzieri contemporaneamente!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00189=Spero che siate in vena di arraffare qualche tesoro, compari.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00190=Dieci eroi sulla cassa del morto. Yo ho ho... Ehi! Chi s'è fregato il mio rum?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00198=Ora conoscerete la mia ira.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00200=E adesso cadrete.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00202=Quanto basta per il mio disturbo, per ora! Caricate i cannoni!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00207=Arr! Qua la mano. Diamo a quei bastardi un salutino esplosivo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00234= Corre voce che ci sia un tesoro al porto... Correte a recuperarlo!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00235=Adesso basta! Noi non lavoriamo gratis!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00236=Bene, allora... Chi ha la grana per i miei servigi?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00237=Arg! Arg! Che c'è? Mi piace dirlo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00238=Fa cantare quel cannone o lo carico con il tuo cranio!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00239=Ecco un bel bottino!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00242=Chi prende per primo il mio bottino?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00247=Che cos'abbiamo qui? Altri bricconi in visita alla Baia di Cuornero, eh?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00248=Va bene, marinai d'acqua dolce! Qui tutti devono rispetto al capitano. E questo capitano rispetta una cosa sola: i soldi! Ah ah!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00249=Non m'importa come ve li procurate.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00250=Furto...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00251=Omicidio... che sarà mai!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00252=Basta che tornate alla mia nave e sganciate i dobloni! E io farò assaggiare i miei cannoni ai vostri nemici! Ah ah ah!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00254=Sappiate che questo regno è sotto la MIA protezione. Si piega a ogni MIO capriccio.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00255=Se vi preme vincere, conquistate il tributo in mio nome.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00256=Siate i primi e otterrete la mia benedizione.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00257=I vostri nemici cadranno... Le loro difese fiaccate e inservibili.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00258=Ma vi conviene sfruttare il vantaggio. Il mio favore non è eterno. Ah ah ah.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00259=Che ne dite? Siete pronti a iniziare?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00260=Osate avventurarvi nella Valle Maledetta? Ah ah ah. Divertente.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00261=Le miniere si apriranno fra poco, eroi... presto i non morti si risveglieranno.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00262=Nelle miniere si annida la morte... Riuscirete a dominare le tenebre?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00263=Siete pronti a combattere i non morti? Tra poco le miniere si apriranno.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00264=I morti risorgono, eroi. Avete l'ardire di entrare nelle miniere?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00265=Adesso non si torna più indietro...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00266=Entrate, eroi. I dannati vi attendono.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00267=Lo sentite questo sferragliare? (darkly) Credo che abbiano fame...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00268=Sorgete, golem, e scatenate la vostra furia!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00269=Che i miei golem risorgano!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00270=Questo è il momento del ritorno dei miei golem.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00271=Ben fatto, il vostro golem è più forte di quello dei nemici.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00272=Il vostro golem è completo... ma è più debole di quello dei vostri avversari.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00273=I golem sono equivalenti in termini di forza.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00274=I golem ritornano... Il vostro è molto più potente.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00275=Ben fatto. Il vostro golem è molto più forte di quello del nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00276=Si levano i golem... Ma, badate, il vostro è molto più debole di quello del nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00277=Dovrete recuperare molti più teschi di così, se volete un golem più forte.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00278=I golem si sono rianimati, e la loro forza si equivale.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00279=Sembra che la potenza dei due golem sia analoga.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00280=I miei golem fanno ritorno... Sarà divertente.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00281=Date sfogo alla vostra incontenibile rabbia!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00282=Tenetevi forte, sarà un spettacolo da brivido.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00283=<Dark laughter>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00284=Oh bene, l'attrazione principale sta per iniziare.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00285=Bene, si preannuncia davvero agghiacciante.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00286=Benvenuti, temerari eroi... nelle Miniere Infestate. Qui, la morte regna sovrana....
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00287=Presto le miniere si apriranno... e l'orrore che vi dimora si risveglierà.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00288=Forse, potremmo stabilire un accordo vantaggioso per tutti.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00289=Uccidete i non morti. Strappate loro quei teschi maledetti.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00290=In cambio, evocherò i miei potenti Golem d'Ossa.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00291=Essi abbatteranno le difese del vostro nemico. Dunque... affare fatto?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00292=Gli antichi altari si risvegliano. Controllateli per liberare il Drago Cavaliere!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00293=Gli altari stanno accumulando potere. Il Drago Cavaliere chiama dall'interno della pietra.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00294=Presto gli altari si risveglieranno, eroi...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00295=Il potere cresce negli altari. Scatenate la collera del drago!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00296=Presto, attivate gli altari e il potere del drago sarà vostro.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00297=Il drago si è risvegliato... Scatenate il suo potere!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00298=Attivate gli altari. Prendete il potere del Drago Cavaliere!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00299=Liberate il Drago Cavaliere, e abbattete i vostri nemici!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00300=È tempo! Liberate il Drago Cavaliere!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00301=Il potere del drago è vostro, eroi!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00302=Annientate i vostri nemici!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00303=Il vostro nemico controlla i santuari, eroi...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00304=Ora affronterete la collera del drago.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00305=Non resta molto tempo, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00306=Che i vostri nemici brucino!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00307=I vostri nemici diverranno cenere!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00308=Torno a vivere!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00309=Brucerete.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00310=La fiamma purifica tutto.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00311=Vi ridurrò in cenere. 
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00312=Non voglio tornare in quella prigione! No!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00313=No... non ho finito!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00314=I draghi torneranno al potere!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00315=I Draghi reclamano questo regno!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00316=I giardini della Contea del Drago... Meravigliosi, nevvero? Tuttavia, si fondano sull'inganno...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00317=La gente ha dimenticato la mia stirpe, ha dimenticato che i Draghi dominavano questi luoghi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00318=Attivate gli altari del sole e della luna, e la magia che tiene in scacco il mio Drago Cavaliere si indebolirà.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00319=Vi donerò il suo potere. Egli brucerà i vostri nemici. Spezzerà le loro fortificazioni. Ricorderà a questo mondo la sua vera appartenenza.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00320=Il Drago rinascerà. Controllatene i poteri, o ne verrete distrutti... La scelta sta a voi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00321=Il vostro golem è più debole di quello del nemico. Preparate le vostre difese.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00322=La forza dei golem si equivale. Preparatevi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00323=L'evocazione è completa. Il vostro golem è più forte di quello nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00324=Il vostro golem è più forte di quello dei nemici. Approfittatene.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00325=Un debole golem. Raccogliete più teschi, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00326=È fatto. Il vostro golem è forte tanto quanto quello del nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00327=Liberatevi e distruggete i nemici!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00328=Uccidete i non morti e reclamatene i teschi, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00329=Raccogliete i teschi per potenziare il vostro golem!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00330=Presto i dannati torneranno. Preparatevi eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00331=Ascoltate, eroi... Presto i non morti si leveranno nelle miniere.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00332=Risvegliatevi, miei golem, e liberate la vostra collera sconfinata!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00333=I santuari si risvegliano. Chi controllerà il potere del Drago Cavaliere?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00334=Il drago attende, eroi! Liberatelo, e annientate i vostri nemici.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00335=L'ora è giunta! Scatenate il potere del drago!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00336=La fine è vicina, il drago è rinato nelle mani dei vostri nemici.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00337=Il vostro nemico cadrà!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00338=Il fuoco vi consumerà!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00339=Il tempo... stringe...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00340=La notte calerà fra poco eroi... Spero che siate pronti.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00341=Cala la notte, eroi. Quanto amo guardare il mio giardino al chiaro di luna.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00342=La notte scende ancora una volta, e presto i mutanti risorgeranno.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00343=La notte è giunta, eroi. Ricordate: uccidete i mutanti e recuperatene i semi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00344=Farà notte fra 30 secondi. Siete pronti a divertirvi?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00345=I mutanti sorgono! Uccideteli... Impossessatevi dei loro semi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00346=I mutanti sorgono... Uccideteli e raccoglietene i semi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00347=È tempo... Fate ciò che va fatto.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00348=I mutanti tornano a levarsi. Liberate i miei semi, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00349=Massacrateli tutti. Riportatemi i semi!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00350=Il chiarore dell'alba... affrettatevi, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00351=L'alba è vicina... Il nostro tempo è quasi scaduto.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00352=La luce. Il giorno è sopraggiunto.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00353=Maledetto sole... Recuperate i miei semi, presto...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00358=Avete abbastanza semi. Portatemeli... Migliorerò la vostra debole carne...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00359=Finalmente, avete abbastanza semi. Venite... date lustro al mio giardino.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00360=Portate quei semi al mio terreno... e dissetatevi col terrore del nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00361=Piantate i semi, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00362=Ora venite a piantare i semi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00363=Non mi deludete. Piantate i semi... prendete il mio potere.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00364=Venite al terreno fertile... Piantate i semi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00365=Piantate i semi, creature di carne.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00366=Il vostro Terrore ha preso vita! Andate! Mietete i cadaveri dei nemici.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00367=Eccellente. Avanzate. Sradicate i forti del nemico!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00368=Alzati, mio Terrore! Sottrai linfa vitale ai tuoi nemici!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00369=Il vostro nemico ha generato un Terrore.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00370=Il Terrore del vostro nemico è sbocciato.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00371=È spuntato un Terrore per i vostri nemici.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00372=Il vostro Terrore ha preso vita.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00373=Finalmente, il vostro Terrore è vivo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00374=Il vostro Terrore è sbocciato. Pregate che sia più forte di quello del nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00375=Il vostro nemico ha generato un Terrore.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00376=Sembra che i nemici abbiano generato un Terrore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00377=Eroi, anche il vostro nemico ha generato un Terrore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00378=No, il mio bel Terrore è caduto.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00379=Il vostro Terrore è caduto. Siete tornati di carne e pelle.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00380=Il vostro Terrore, il mio bambino, è caduto.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00381=Il Terrore del nemico è concime.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00382=Il Terrore del nemico è caduto.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00383=Il Terrore del nemico non è che una buccia vuota.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00384=Il vostro Terrore è caduto, ma non quello del nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00385=Il Terrore del nemico è vivo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00386=Adesso siete soli.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00387=Nessuno può fermarvi. Annientateli!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00388=Sì... Guidate il mio Terrore. Massacrateli tutti.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00389=Il loro Terrore è caduto. Andate... Mietete i loro cadaveri.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00394=Avete raccolto semi a sufficienza! Piantateli nel terreno, e i germogli miglioreranno la vostra debole carne...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00395=Finalmente, avete abbastanza semi. Piantateli qui... date lustro al mio giardino.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00396=Ben fatto, eroi. Portate qui quei semi e potrete assaporare la paura del nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00397=È sbocciato un Terrore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00398=Un Terrore ha preso vita.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00399=È sbocciato un Terrore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00400=Un Terrore ha preso vita.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00401=Albeggia... I miei bambini devono dormire, per adesso.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00402=Vedo che siete sopravvissuti a un'altra notte. Complimenti.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00403=È giunta l'alba, eroi, e adesso i miei dolci bambini devono riposare.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00404=È finita, per adesso... Ma non rilassatevi troppo. Gli infestati faranno ritorno.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00405=Ah, eroi. Siete arrivati giusto in tempo per vedere i miei giardini animarsi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00406=Di notte, ci trasformiamo... il Giardino del Terrore fiorisce.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00407=Uccidete i mutanti decerebrati e prendete i loro semi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00408=Quando ne avrete abbastanza, vi concederò il potere della natura.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00411=Venite a piantare i semi della distruzione del vostro nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00412=Adesso dovreste piantare i vostri semi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00413=Che state aspettando? Avete i semi... Piantateli!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00414=Dirigetevi al terreno e piantate i semi, svelti.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00415=Piantate i semi... Anche se è giorno, posso comunque darvi potere.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00416=Ci siamo! Il vostro Terrore ha preso vita! Usatelo per schiacciare i cadaveri dei nemici.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00417=Ben fatto! il Terrore sradicherà i forti del vostro nemico!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00418=Splendido. Il Terrore sottrarrà linfa vitale al nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00419=Il vostro nemico ha generato un Terrore. Interessante.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00420=Mi dispiace tanto, ma i vostri nemici hanno generato un Terrore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00421=È spuntato un Terrore per i vostri nemici, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00422=Il vostro Terrore ha preso vita. Non è adorabile?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00423=Direi che quel Terrore potrebbe esservi utile.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00424=È sbocciato il vostro Terrore. Chissà se è più forte di quello del nemico?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00425=Eroi, anche il vostro nemico ha generato un Terrore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00426=Sembra che i nemici abbiano generato un Terrore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00427=Il vostro nemico ha generato un Terrore, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00428=Il vostro Terrore è avvizzito.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00429=Il vostro Terrore è concime.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00430=Il vostro Terrore è stato abbattuto.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00431=Ben fatto! Il Terrore dei vostri nemici è avvizzito.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00432=Avete distrutto il Terrore del nemico.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00433=Eccellente, il Terrore del nemico non è che una buccia vuota.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00434=Il vostro Terrore è caduto, ma non quello del nemico, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00435=Il Terrore del nemico è ancora in vita, eroi!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00436=Spero che riusciate a fermare il nemico anche senza il mio Terrore...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00437=Il Terrore del nemico è caduto. Avanzate, eroi!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00438=Avete distrutto il loro Terrore! Iniziate a impressionarmi, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00439=Il loro Terrore è stato falciato! Continuate a mietere, eroi!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00440=Che notte fantastica... per una maledizione.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00442=Diffondete la mia infestazione. La Regina delle Spore lo esige...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00443=Finalmente, avete abbastanza semi. Il Terrore cresce di nuovo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00444=Avete raccolto semi a sufficienza! Il vostro Terrore cresce.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00445=Ben fatto, eroi. Presto potrete controllare il Terrore Arboreo.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00446=Ora i semi dovrebbero bastare. Lasciate che il mio Terrore cresca!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00447=Il Terrore attende, eroi. Venite a reclamare il suo potere.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00448=Perché attendete? Il Terrore non dura per sempre.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00449=Il vostro Terrore inizia ad avvizzire. Fossi in voi, mi affretterei.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00450=Che cosa state aspettando? Risvegliate il mio Terrore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00452=Troppo tardi, eroi. Avete rifiutato il mio dono... ora soffrite.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00453=Avete lasciato avvizzire il mio Terrore? Stolti.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00454=Il vostro Terrore è avvizzito... Che spreco.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00455=Che peccato, il vostro Terrore è avvizzito. Il suo potere era forte...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00457=Raccogliete il risultato dei vostri sforzi, eroi. Portate in vita il mio Terrore.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00459=Accogliete il Terrore. Fidatevi, è divertente.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00460=Avete semi a sufficienza. Il terrore cresce!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00461=Finalmente, avete abbastanza semi! Potete sentire il Terrore crescere?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00462=Sì, ne avete abbastanza. Presto il Terrore Arboreo sarà vostro.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00463=Questi semi bastano. Ora, fate crescere il Terrore!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00464=Il Terrore attende. Forza, reclamatene il potere!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00465=Non tardate. Il Terrore è pronto per il suo ospite.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00468=Il Terrore avvizzisce. Non lasciate che i vostri sforzi vadano sprecati.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00469=Il Terrore non può attendere a lungo... Controllate il suo potere.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00470=È l'ora del raccolto. Portate in vita il mio Terrore.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00472=Accogliete il Terrore. Uccidete i vostri nemici!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00473=Avete rifiutato il mio dono? Allora soffrirete.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00474=Il mio Terrore avvizzisce? Stolti!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00475=Il Terrore è avvizzito... Hmph, che spreco.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00476=Come avete osato, lasciar avvizzire il mio Terrore...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00477=I miei golem sono caduti. Non importa, ci sono sempre altri teschi da recuperare.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00478=I golem sono stati sconfitti.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00479=Pare che i miei golem siano tornati alla terra. Per ora.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00480=I golem torneranno, eroi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00481=E così, i Golem d'Ossa cadono. Polvere alla polvere, come si dice.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00482=Che la maledizione abbia fine. Almeno finché qualcuno non ottiene di nuovo il mio favore.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00483=E così la maledizione finisce. Forse ora capirete il suo valore, giusto?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00484=Ben fatto. I vostri nemici verranno indeboliti. Che cadano ai vostri piedi.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00485=La maledizione si abbatte su di voi, eroi. Riuscirete a sopravviverle?

Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00008=Che gioco spassoso! Collaborate, e stavolta mi prenderete di sicuro.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00009=Ah, ci si rivede! Tu e i tuoi amici riuscirete a prendermi stavolta?
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00010=Dovete collaborare se volete starmi dietro, ragazzi! Ah ah!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00011=Mi sto davvero divertendo! Andiamo avanti? Sì?
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00012=Non abbiamo già giocato oggi? Non importa. Unisciti ai tuoi amici e provate a prendermi, se riuscite!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00014=Ben fatto, eroi. Che il futuro vi riservi speranza e fortuna!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00015=Ah ah! È stato fantastico! La mia benedizione è vostra, eroi.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00017=Ah, mi avete preso di nuovo! Ottimo!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00018=Non mi stanco mai di questo gioco! Ben fatto, eroi!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00019=Potrei andare avanti all'infinito! Grazie per avermi dato tanta gioia.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00020=Che inseguimento esilarante! Il futuro vi sarà benevolo.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00021=Le vostre abilità aumentano, eroi! Vedo che la mia benedizione vi favorisce.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00023=Quasi... ma non temete, ci rivedremo di nuovo.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00024=Potete sempre riprovare, eroi. Collaborate e non arrendetevi!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00025=Presto tornerò, eroi. Alla prossima!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00026=Vediamo se riuscite a prendermi. Solo i più abili otterranno la mia benedizione! Ah ah!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00027=Davvero notevole, eroi! Avete ottenuto la mia benedizione. Che la fortuna vi arrida!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00028=Bravissimi, mi avete preso! Che la mia benedizione vi sia di buon auspicio.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00029=Ah ah! Adoro questo gioco! Rispetto e fair play, eroi.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00003=Ahhhhh!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00004=Salute, eroe... Sono Uther l'Araldo della Luce, e tu sei stato scelto dal Nexus.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00005=Nexus? Questa roba ha a che fare coi protoss?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00006=Cosa? No, ecco vedi...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00007=Il Nexus è una tempesta cosmica in cui mondi appartenenti a dimensioni spazio-temporali differenti entrano in collisione.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00008=Sei stato evocato qui per essere messo alla prova in combattimento e per coprirti di gloria. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00009=Gloria, eh? Basta non coprirsi di altro...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00010=Questo portale ci condurrà alla Corte del Corvo, uno dei molti reami del Nexus. Clicca con il destro per raggiungerla.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00012=Questo portale ci condurrà alla Corte del Corvo, uno dei molti reami del Nexus. Clicca per raggiungerla.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00013=Ehi, non sono esattamente un novellino, Uther. So il fatto mio...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00014=Non ne dubito, amico, ma qui le cose sono diverse. È meglio impararlo fin da subito!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00015=Un servitore nemico? Di già? Siamo appena arrivati... Bah, premi il tasto A e clicca su di lui per attaccarlo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00016=Un servitore nemico? Di già? Siamo appena arrivati... Bah, premi il tasto A e clicca con il destro su di lui per attaccarlo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00017=Un servitore nemico? Di già? Siamo appena arrivati... Bah, premi il tasto d'attacco e clicca su di lui.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00018=Continua ad avanzare. Puoi vedere la posizione dei servitori qui sulla minimappa.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00019=Hai intenzione di darmi una mano, Uther?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00020=Io il tutorial l'ho già superato, figliolo. Devi cavartela da solo. E poi, credo che tu sia in grado di gestire qualche servitore.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00021=Quel coso ha appena espulso una specie di palla luminosa...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00022=Un globo rigenerante. Raggiungilo e ripristinerà Salute e Mana per te e per gli alleati circostanti.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00023=Oh, sento che le forze ritornano!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00024=Quello era un globo rigenerante. Ripristina Salute e Mana per te e per gli alleati circostanti.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00028=Ben fatto, sembra che abbiamo raggiunto la città.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00029=Ehi, frena un momento... Prima di andare da qualche altra parte, mi piacerebbe capire bene dove... Che cos'è esattamente questo Nexus?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00030=Il Nexus è una tempesta cosmica in cui mondi appartenenti a dimensioni spazio-temporali differenti entrano in collisione.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00031=Un numero sempre maggiore di noi viene convocato in questo regno enigmatico e messo a confronto con altri combattenti di pari valore.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00032=Quindi, sono qui per combattere.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00033=E per coprirti di gloria.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00034=OK. Questo mi basta... Andiamo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00035=Diablo?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00036=Osate opporvi al Signore del Terrore?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00037=Ah ah ah! Mi chiedo... Che gusto ha la tua paura, mortale?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00038=Non saprei. Non sono neanche sicuro che la paura abbia un gusto...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00039=Mmmgh! Ti divorerò!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00040=Be', non fa un'ottima impressione, sbaglio? Farei meglio a insegnargli le buone maniere. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00041=Ti spiace spiegarmi che sta succedendo qui?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00042=Questo reame è chiamato la Corte del Corvo... e sembra essere assediato dal signore dei demoni Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00043=Le abilità compaiono sulla barra delle azioni a fondo schermo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00044=Se vuoi affrontare Diablo dovrai sfruttare al meglio le tue abilità.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00045=Prima di tutto, usa il tuo Proiettile Perforante contro i soldati non morti di Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00046=Prima di tutto, usa il tuo Proiettile Perforante contro i servitori di Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00047=Calma, figliolo. Prendi bene la mira e riprova.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00048=Premi il tasto Q, poi prendi di mira gli scheletri con la freccia. Quando sei pronto, clicca per fare fuoco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00049=Premi il tasto Q, poi prendi di mira gli scheletri con la freccia. Quando sei pronto, clicca con il destro per sparare.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00050=Attiva l'abilità Proiettile Perforante, poi prendi di mira gli scheletri con la freccia. Quando sei pronto, clicca per fare fuoco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00051=Cliccare con il destro annulla un'abilità. Quando la freccia è attiva, clicca con il sinistro per fare fuoco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00052=Cliccare con il sinistro annulla un'abilità. Quando la freccia è attiva, clicca con il destro per fare fuoco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00053=Premi il tasto Q, poi prendi di mira i nemici con la freccia. Quando sei pronto, clicca per fare fuoco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00054=Premi il tasto Q, poi prendi di mira i nemici con la freccia. Quando sei pronto, clicca con il destro per sparare.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00055=Attiva Proiettile Perforante, poi prendi di mira i nemici con la freccia. Quando sei pronto, clicca per fare fuoco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00056=Dopo aver premuto il tasto Q, prendi di mira i nemici con la freccia e clicca per fare fuoco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00057=Dopo aver premuto il tasto Q, prendi di mira i nemici con la freccia e clicca con il destro per sparare.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00058=Una volta attivato Proiettile Perforante, prendi di mira i nemici con la freccia e clicca per fare fuoco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00059=Premi il tasto Q, prendi di mira i nemici con la freccia e clicca per fare fuoco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00060=Premi il tasto Q, prendi di mira i nemici con la freccia e clicca con il destro per sparare.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00061=Attiva Proiettile Perforante, prendi di mira i nemici con la freccia e clicca per fare fuoco.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00062=Così! Usando le abilità infliggerai più danni rispetto agli attacchi base con l'arma.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00063=Più avanti ci sono altri scheletri. Usa Proiettile Perforante per sconfiggerli.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00064=Più avanti ci sono altri servitori. Usa Proiettile Perforante per sconfiggerli.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00065=Bel tiro, figliolo!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00066=Ti consiglio di provarlo, Uther. È molto più efficace che colpire le cose con quel tuo martellone.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00067=Ricorda, puoi usare Proiettile Perforante per uccidere gruppi di servitori contemporaneamente.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00068=Ci sono troppi scheletri... dobbiamo ritirarci.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00069=Brutta faccenda. I nostri ragazzi stanno avendo la peggio.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00070=L'abilità Ispirazione rafforza sia te sia i tuoi alleati.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00071=Devi utilizzarla su quei fanti e proseguire il combattimento!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00072=Mi sento in grado di conquistare il mondo! Carica!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00073=Non esagerare, figliolo...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00074=L'abilità Ispirazione aumenta la tua velocità d'attacco e quella degli alleati circostanti. Usala il più spesso possibile.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00075=L'abilità Ispirazione rafforza sia te sia gli alleati vicini. Usala il più spesso possibile.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00076=Ricorda, Proiettile Perforante può uccidere gruppi di scheletri mentre i tuoi servitori combattono.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00077=Ispirare i servitori ti aiuterà a sconfiggere gli scheletri più rapidamente.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00078=Il vostro rinnovato coraggio non vi salverà. Le vostre futili vite finiscono ora.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00079=I nostri fanti stanno attaccando Diablo. Sblocca la visuale per dare un'occhiata.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00080=Bene. Ora fai scorrere la mappa e vediamo cosa combina Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00081=Bruciate nel fuoco infernale!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00082=È ferito! Adesso è il momento di colpire!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00083=Puoi premere la barra spaziatrice e riportare la visuale sul tuo eroe quando vuoi.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00084=Riporta la visuale sul tuo eroe e andiamo avanti!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00085=Se preferisci, puoi bloccare nuovamente la visuale premendo un'altra volta il tasto L.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00086=Se preferisci, puoi sempre tornare alla visuale bloccata.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00087=Questo reame e le scellerate anime che contiene appartengono a me!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00088=Non finché ci sono io.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00089=Diablo gioca sporco. Usa Proiettile Perforante per respingerlo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00090=Darò la caccia alla tua anima per l'eternità, James Raynor.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00091=Ben fatto, figliolo! Ma non è ancora finita.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00092=Usa la Pietra del Ritorno per raggiungermi. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00093=Sta' fermo mentre la Pietra del Ritorno ti riporta a casa.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00094=(whistles) Che sciccheria...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00095=Questa è la Sala delle Tempeste. È qui che gli eroi vengono convocati all'inizio di una battaglia.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00096=Lo scopo è distruggere il nucleo della squadra nemica e proteggere il nostro dagli attacchi.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00097=Entrambi i nuclei evocano dei servitori che seguono questo percorso affrontandosi in ondate infinite.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00098=Ricevuto. Eliminiamo il nucleo di Diablo ed è fatta, mi sembra lineare. Ma rinfrescami la memoria, perché lo facciamo?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00099=Sai... È meglio non arrovellarti troppo su queste cose...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00100=Per cominciare, raggiungi la prima linea.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00101=Tritacarne vuole giocare!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00102=Pessima idea, quella... Attaccare un forte da soli è praticamente un suicidio.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00103=I servitori ti aiuteranno nell'avanzata verso il nucleo nemico. Rimani dietro di loro e lascia che assorbano i danni.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00104=Attento! Attacca le torri solo quando sono concentrate su altri bersagli.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00105=Ben fatto, figliolo! Hai dimostrato il tuo valore. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00106=Che posso dire? Ho un discreto talento per far esplodere le cose.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00107=Servitori e pietra non mi fermeranno! Ora banchetterò con il vostro terrore!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00108="Banchettare con il mio terrore?" È la seconda volta... Adesso ti spiego. La paura o il terrore non si possono mangiare.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00109=Mmhmm! Lui ragione. Terrore no gusto.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00110=Vedi? Anche il puzzone qui lo capisce.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00111=Aaargh! Basta!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00112=Un attimo. Ma non ero morto?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00113=Tranquillo, la morte nel Nexus è solo un contrattempo. Dopo una breve pausa, sarai di nuovo vivo e pronto a combattere.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00114=Spero non ti dispiaccia se stavolta mi unisco a te. Giusto per ristabilire l'equilibrio.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00115=Al contrario... Diamoci dentro, socio!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00116=Monta in sella e torniamo a combattere.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00117=Se usi la cavalcatura, torneremo in prima linea molto più in fretta.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00118=Puoi smontare premendo di nuovo il tasto della cavalcatura.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00119=Fa' attenzione. Non ci sarò sempre io a salvarti.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00120=Attento, figliolo. Ti ho salvato di nuovo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00121=Raccogli i globi per rigenerare Salute e Mana.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00122=Le torri nemiche possono essere letali, ma attaccheranno sempre i servitori prima di far fuoco sugli eroi.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00123=Attacca una torre solo quando ci sono dei servitori nelle vicinanze.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00124=Scappa, presto! Torneremo quando ci saranno dei servitori ad aiutarci!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00125=Sta' dietro i nostri servitori e lascia che assorbano i danni.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00126=Ricorda di usare Proiettile Perforante e Ispirazione per eliminare più rapidamente i nemici.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00127=Se dimentichi un comando, lo puoi trovare qui in alto a sinistra.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00128=Benone! Non rimane altro che il nucleo nemico!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00129=Ehi, hai altro da aggiungere, alito di fuoco?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00130=Aaargh! Avrò la mia vendetta, James Raynor. Non finisce qui!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00131=Ehi! Così non vale!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00132=Non combatterai da solo!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00133=Ma bene, guarda chi ha recuperato il Nexus... Benvenuto, cowboy. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00134=Nova? Adesso inizio a sentirmi un po' a casa. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00135=Non rilassarti, la situazione qui è movimentata. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00136=Ah, ah. Proprio come piace a me...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00137=Forza, ragazzone, vediamo che sai fare. Sono pronto al secondo round.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00138=<Roar>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00139=Spero tu sia pronto, Raynor. Adesso il gioco si fa duro!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00140=Sono nato pronto, Uther...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00141=Ricorda, se sei ferito puoi tornare qui alla nostra Sala delle Tempeste, e le tue ferite guariranno automaticamente col tempo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00142=Come prima, lo scopo è battere la squadra nemica e distruggerne il nucleo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00143=OK, da quello che vedo ci sono tre corsie che portano alla base nemica. Meglio assicurarci che tutte siano coperte.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00144=Esatto, figliolo. Quando la battaglia inizia, seguimi e sta' pronto a combattere.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00145=Quando elimini servitori, eroi o strutture della squadra nemica, la nostra ottiene esperienza.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00146=L'esperienza ottenuta è comune, e tutto quel che fai contribuisce al successo della squadra.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00147=Qui sono mostrati l'esperienza e il livello attuale di entrambe le squadre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00148=Quando la barra blu si riempie del tutto, la nostra squadra avanza di livello e diventiamo tutti più forti.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00149=Vediamo di avanzare, allora.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00150=Ben fatto, siamo avanzati di livello!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00151=Le tue statistiche sono migliorate e le tue abilità sono più efficaci.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00152=Sembra parecchio utile. Hai qualche altro consiglio per me?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00153=Avanzare di livello sblocca anche dei talenti per personalizzare le tue abilità e modificare il tuo stile di combattimento.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00154=Ehi, mica male! Mi sento già più forte.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00155=Hai sbloccato la tua abilità eroica, un'abilità molto potente che può ribaltare le sorti della battaglia. Usala con giudizio.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00156=Abilità eroica, eh? Non vedo l'ora di provarla.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00157=Diavolo... Non mi sento molto bene.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00158=Raggiungi una fonte curativa. Puoi cliccarci con il destro per recuperare Salute.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00159=Raggiungi una fonte curativa. Puoi cliccarci sopra per recuperare Salute.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00160=Raggiungi una fonte curativa. Puoi cliccarci sopra per recuperare Salute.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00161=Ecco fatto. Dopo che avrai bevuto da una fonte, Salute e Mana si rigenereranno col tempo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00162=Ma prima di riutilizzare la fonte, dovrai aspettare che si riempia di nuovo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00163=Raynor, ritirati subito!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00164=Devo ripiegare.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00165=Raynor, potresti esserci d'aiuto qui. Stiamo per "incoraggiare" alcuni di questi giganti da assedio a unirsi alle nostre forze.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00166=Incoraggiare?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00167=Oh, è più divertente di quel che sembra. Fidati... <reload sound>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00168=Ti spiace restare per un po' su quel segnalatore?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00169=Ecco fatto. Dopo aver conquistato un campo di mercenari, i suoi occupanti si uniranno allo scontro nella corsia più vicina.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00170=OK, seguiamo questi cosi da assedio fino al forte nemico e buttiamo giù quel maledetto affare.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00171=I giganti da assedio sono molto efficaci nel distruggere i forti da lontano.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00172=Raynor, ci farebbe comodo altro aiuto. Prova a conquistare un campo di mercenari da solo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00173=Non dimenticare di usare le tue abilità per sconfiggerli.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00174=Be', quei massi sono abbastanza lenti. Magari li posso schivare.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00175=Raynor, raggiungi quella torre di guardia. Se riesci a conquistarla, ci garantirà la visuale sulla zona.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00176=Rimani qualche istante vicino alla torre per attivarla.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00177=Ritirati, figliolo. È pericoloso attaccare una torre senza servitori.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00178=Fa' attenzione, non ci sono servitori a proteggerti da quella torre.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00179=Sbrigati, figliolo. Abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto contro questi giganti.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00180=Sarà meglio che aiuti Uther prima che al vecchio gli venga un infarto.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00181=Raynor, mi servirebbe il tuo aiuto in questa corsia.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00182=Hmm... devo ricordarmi di usare queste abilità più spesso.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00183=La tua Salute scarseggia. Raggiungi una fonte curativa.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00184=Sei rimasto senza mana. Puoi bere da una fonte curativa o usare la Pietra del Ritorno per rientrare alla base e recuperare mana nel tempo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00185=Ora sarebbe il caso di prendere un campo di mercenari.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00186=Sono messo male, e la fonte è esaurita. Mi conviene usare la Pietra del Ritorno e curarmi alla base.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00187=Monta in sella e potrai tornare allo scontro più in fretta.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00188=Usando una cavalcatura, ti sposterai più velocemente. Il tasto predefinito della cavalcatura è Z.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00189=Bando alle ciance, sceriffo. Scegli una corsia e preparati allo scontro.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00190=Meno male, un globo rigenerante! Ne avevo proprio bisogno.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00191=Non dimenticare di scegliere un talento.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00192=Il nemico ha conquistato la nostra torre di guardia. Se possibile, dovremmo riprendercela.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00193=Con un Proiettile Perforante potrei ucciderli molto in fretta.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00194=Raynor, usa Ispirazione per rafforzare i nostri attacchi!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00195=Cliccare con il destro annulla le abilità. Quando devi usarne una, clicca con il sinistro per attivarla.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00196=Cliccare con il sinistro annulla le abilità. Quando devi usarne una, clicca con il destro per attivarla.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00197=Hai annullato un'abilità. Assicurati di cliccare il pulsante giusto per usare Proiettile Perforante.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00198=Cliccare con il destro annulla un'abilità. Clicca con il sinistro per richiamare l'Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00199=Cliccare con il sinistro annulla un'abilità. Clicca con il destro per richiamare l'Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00200=Hai annullato un'abilità. Assicurati di cliccare il pulsante giusto per richiamare l'Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00201=Quando la Salute scarseggia, puoi curarti usando una fonte curativa, oppure puoi teletrasportarti alla base e recuperare Salute nel tempo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00202=Non essere avventato. Farti ammazzare durante una carica con poca Salute fornisce esperienza al nemico e ci lascia con un uomo in meno.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00203=Usa la Pietra del Ritorno per tornare al nucleo, ma assicurati di essere nascosto o lontano dai nemici quando la attivi.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00204=Ehi! Mi hai interrotto il teletrasporto!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00205=L'uso della Pietra del Ritorno richiede del tempo, e può essere interrotto dagli attacchi nemici. Usala soltanto in zone sicure.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00206=Direi che è il momento perfetto per richiamare l'Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00207=Scommetto che se richiamo l'Hyperion ora possiamo eliminare quei nemici.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00208=E tu cosa saresti? Una specie di cavaliere?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00209=Un paladino, per l'esattezza.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00210=Be', è più o meno la stessa cosa, no?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00211=A dire il vero no, un paladino sfrutta il potere della...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00212=Ti fermo subito, amico. Non sono particolarmente interessato...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00213=Sei una vera gioia per gli occhi, Nova.

Conversation/Spooky18/Line00002=La Valle del Re cadrà. Che serva da lezione per chi si oppone al Signore dei Corvi.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00003=Il potere del Signore dei Corvi cala su questo patetico regno.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00004=Zarya, Cavaliere Fantasma, avvolgi questo reame nelle tue empie fiamme.

Conversation/Spooky18/Line00007=Uno dei miei generali è caduto. Fastidiosi moscerini.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00008=Il Dragone Spettrale Alexstrasza, Aspetto della Non Morte, avanza contro di voi.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00009=Aspetto della Non Morte, il Signore dei Corvi richiede il tuo servizio!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00010=Come avete potuto uccidere ciò che non ha vita?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00011=Il Dragone Spettrale è caduto? Non finisce qui.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00012=Strega della Valle, è il momento di condannare questo reame!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00013=La Valle del Re pagherà cara la sua insolenza.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00014=Ecco una maledizione per accogliere gli intrusi.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00015=Perché non muori?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00016=Custode dei Ragni, ho una nuova preda per te.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00017=Da' la caccia ai miei nemici, generale. Non avere pietà.

Conversation/Spooky18/Line00020=Pensavate che sarebbe finita così facilmente? 
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00021=Avete eliminato i miei generali. Molto bene, vediamo che cosa sapete fare contro il Drago Cavaliere.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00022=Godetevi le vostre inutili vittorie, eroi. La Valle del Re è condannata.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00023=Avete vinto, eroi. I campioni di un reame morente.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00024=Vi credete tanto furbi?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00025=Un cimelio del passato...
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00026=Uhm. Godetevi quel reperto da museo.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00027=Che spreco di energie.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00031=Ne ho avuto abbastanza.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00032=Come osi opporti al Signore dei Corvi?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00033=No...
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00034=Avete perso il mio favore.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00035=Le mie forze sono indebolite, è vero. Ma nessun potere può fermare la mia collera ora.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00036=La Valle del Re cadrà oggi. Parola del Signore dei Corvi.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00037=Eroi, imbracciate le armi e annientate i servitori del Signore dei Corvi!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00038=Oggi il Signore dei Corvi conoscerà la sconfitta. La Valle del Re trionferà!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00039=La perfidia del Signore dei Corvi finisce qui. Non tollererò più le sue azioni!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00040=Il Cavaliere Fantasma del Signore dei Corvi vuole ridurre il mio regno in cenere. Spegnete la sua empia fiamma.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00041=Questa armatura vuota è uno dei generali del Signore dei Corvi. Cadrà, proprio come il suo capo.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00042=Nessun fantasma può opporsi a un cavaliere della Valle del Re.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00043=Non temere, Signore dei Corvi. Presto raggiungerai il tuo Cavaliere Fantasma.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00044=Il Signore dei Corvi osa attaccare la Valle del Re con un drago? Che insolente.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00045=Il Dragone Spettrale un tempo era una nobile creatura, ora è costretta a servire un empio padrone. Liberate il suo spirito.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00046=Che la morte liberi l'anima di questo drago.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00047=La Valle del Re è un reame della vita. La Non Morte non ha spazio qui.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00048=Non sarà finita fino a che non sarai sconfitto, Signore dei Corvi.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00049=La Strega della Valle ha stretto un patto oscuro per ottenere il suo potere. Il nostro acciaio, tuttavia, è più forte.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00050=Quella strega vuole "punirci". Fatele capire il vero significato di quella parola.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00051=La sua vile magia non profanerà più il mio reame.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00052=La maledizione è spezzata, Signore dei Corvi. Come la tua strega.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00053=Il Signore dei Corvi ha inviato la Custode dei Ragni contro di noi. Non siamo la preda di nessuno.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00054=Presto il cacciatore capirà che è diventato la preda.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00055=Schiacciata, come un ragno qualunque.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00056=Tessi pure le tue tele, Signore dei Corvi. Le strapperò una a una.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00057=Il Drago Cavaliere è stato corrotto? Pagherai per questa blasfemia, Signore dei Corvi!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00058=No, mio amato! Eroi, fate ciò che dovete.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00059=È stato tutto inutile?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00060=Anche se io cadrò vittima della maledizione, la Valle del Re sopravvivrà.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00061=La Valle del Re trionferà contro il Nexus Oscuro!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00062=Attaccare il mio reame è stato un errore, Signore dei Corvi.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00063=Le vostre azioni diverranno leggenda, eroi.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00064=Le nostre nobili forze non saranno sconfitte da tali mostruosità.

Conversation/Toy18/Line00002=Questo è il tabellone. Quel pezzo sei tu. Poi ci sono i dadi... le carte... le stelline... Oh, non vedo l'ora!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00003=Allora, il gioco è fare il giro del tabellone, finire le missioni e raccogliere i premi fantastici! Dai, tira il dado!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00004=Wow, che fortuna. OK, quando arrivi su una casella, devi fare quello che dice la carta missione!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00005=OK, quando arrivi su una casella, devi fare quello che dice la carta missione!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00006=Hai completato una missione! Ti meriti una stellina! Ce ne vogliono tre per avere un forziere di "segreti". Nemmeno io so cosa c'è dentro...
Conversation/Toy18/Line00007=Questa è la missione di Mefisto... Eh? È Tritacarne? Davvero? Non vorrà mica essere ricucito? È un po'... strano, ma tu fallo lo stesso, OK?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00008=Mi è sempre piaciuto quello stupido orsacchiotto, ma... ma, qualcuno sa dov'è finito Mefisto?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00009=Oh oh. Qualcuno si è seduto su... Volevo dire, qualcosa ha distrutto la stalla degli unicorni. Eh eh. La tua missione è raccogliere materiali per costruirne una nuova.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00010=Missione compiuta! Ecco la tua ricompensa! Io prendo i materiali... Bene, dov'è la colla?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00011=Oh, una missione speciale! Il mio Dehaka si è... fatto male. Se raccogli pezzi di altri giocattoli lo puoi aiutare. Credo.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00012=Wow, ce l'hai fatta? L'hai sistemato? Impossibile! Cioè... ottimo lavoro. Ecco, prendi queste cose.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00013=Oh, le batterie del leone si sono scaricate e non so come ricaricarle. Forse possiamo fargli mangiare dei servitori. Dai, ci dev'essere un modo! Trova una soluzione, per favore.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00014=Oh, ha funzionato! Cioè... certo che ha funzionato! Siamo i migliori! Dammi il cinque!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00015=OK, ti dico cos'è successo. Mi sa che forse ho rotto le armi della bambola di Valeera di mia sorella. Se non la aggiusti sono fritto. Dai! Nuova missione! Sbrigati!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00016=Ce l'hai fatta! Grazie, mi hai salvato. Me la sono vista davvero brutta. Eccoti un premio, OK?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00017=Wow! Hai aggiustato le mie cose! Cioè, hai vinto. Adesso siamo amici per la pelle. Ecco, tieni. Non vedo l'ora di giocare di nuovo.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00018=Hai vinto di nuovo? Wow, ti stai davvero impegnando!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00019=Oh, stai ancora giocando. Non puoi passarci tutta la notte, prima o poi devi ridarmi il tabellone.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00020=Bene! Ecco un altro forziere misterioso. Spero che ci siano dei bei premi!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00021=Forse questo gioco è troppo facile. Dovevo farlo 200 volte più difficile...
Conversation/Toy18/Line00022=Un'altra vittoria! Un altro premio!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00023=Se vai avanti così, finisco i premi. Era meglio se ci pensavo prima...
Conversation/Toy18/Line00024=Ancora tu? Va bene, i premi sono qui, almeno credo.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00025=Congratulazioni, hai vinto! Oh, sei... sei ancora tu, non uno degli altri eroi. Ben fatto... complimenti.

Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00570=Gli eroi nascosti tra i cespugli sono invisibili ai nemici all'esterno. Diventano visibili se escono allo scoperto o se un nemico entra nel cespuglio in cui si nascondono.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00571=Il nucleo ha un potente scudo che si rigenera rapidamente quando non è sotto attacco.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00572=Sei morto, ma non preoccuparti. Resusciterai presto alla base.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00573=Cerca di mantenere alta la salute ed evita gli scontri se si abbassa troppo. Ogni volta che muori il nemico guadagna esperienza.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00574=La tua squadra non può superare il cancello del nemico. Dovrete distruggerlo per passare.

Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00580=Le squadre ottengono esperienza eliminando eroi, servitori e strutture avversarie. Gli eroi devono essere nelle vicinanze per ottenere esperienza.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00581=I forti dispongono di un attacco che riduce la velocità di movimento e d'attacco. Se ti hanno preso di mira, spostati rapidamente fuori portata.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00582=Bere da una fonte curativa rigenera progressivamente Salute e Mana.

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Non ho bisogno del Khala per sapere che cosa ne pensi.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Il nemico cadrà davanti al nostro assalto!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Raynor00=Perduto nel Nexus e in procinto di combattere, ma per il resto... non c'è male.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Tassadar00=Per la gloria di Aiur!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Zeratul00=Anon por-ghal!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Faremo i conti dopo la battaglia, abominio.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill00=Non hai onore.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill01=Che delusione.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill02=Roba da nulla per le lame di un Templare.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill03=Chi si divide, cade.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill04=Una forma di vita inferiore.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillAlarak00=Questa... è una rara soddisfazione.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillKerrigan00=Questo era per Raszagal!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillProtoss00=Avresti dovuto schierarti al mio fianco.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillRaynor00=Sono dolente, amico Raynor.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Mi sono stancato di te!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillTassadar00=A quanto pare ti ho superato, maestro.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillZeratul00=Che Adun ti nasconda la prossima volta.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillZerg00=Epurerò questa galassia dalla vostra specie.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Laugh00=<bemused laugh>
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal00=Proprio come i venti astrali...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal01=La tua cortesia ti fa onore.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal02=Il tuo ausilio è prezioso.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana00=Ho poco mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana01=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana02=Ho bisogno di più mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No01=Ne dubito.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No02=Impossibile.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Il nostro alleato ha bisogno di noi.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Prestatemi aiuto!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Il nemico mi minaccia.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Distruggiamo il nucleo nemico!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Conquistiamo questo campo di mercenari.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Abbattiamo questo forte!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Dobbiamo impadronirci di quella torre.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo prima che sia troppo tardi!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Il nostro forte ha bisogno di difese!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Tenete questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_KillHero00=Uccidete questo nemico, ora!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed00=L'alba verrà.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed01=Forza nell'unità.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed02=Questo reame fa sorgere molte domande, e offre poche risposte...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed03=Gli xel'naga furono coinvolti nella creazione del Nexus? Se è così, non hanno lasciato templi... né nuove forme di vita...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed04=A meno che quelle forme di vita non siano invisibili... e ci controllino grazie a qualche complicato meccanismo digitale. Scontrandosi fra loro...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed05=Forse addirittura migliaia di queste forme di vita, che... che manipolano le nostre vite contemporaneamente? Agh... Ecco, m'è venuta l'emicrania.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed06=Chissà che cosa stanno facendo i Daelaam in mia assenza. Spero che non abbiano spostato gli arredi della mia sala del Concilio. Detesto quando lo fanno.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed07=Dunque, la Lancia di Adun è proprio sopra di me... ma il Mastro di Fase Karax non si trova? <sigh> Tipico.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed08=La pianti di toccarmi? Va' a sfogarti su uno degli orchi! Vedrai quanto gli piace!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed09=A proposito, ho detto che StarCraft non era solo Warcraft nello spazio... Qualunque cosa sia questo Heroes of the Storm non conta.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed10=Sì, la mia astronave mi segue ovunque. Un po' come gli animali da compagnia di voi terran, solo che è utile.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed11=Mi hanno eletto Gerarca solo da poco, ma ho già un sacco di benefici. Pensate, l'assicurazione medica copre anche il dentista. Ora, se solo avessi una bocca...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed12=Che ne pensi della mia nuova armatura? L'ultima mi faceva sentire un po'... esposto.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed13=Sono giovane solo come protoss. Ho vissuto duecento anni più della maggior parte di voi, e ti sarei grato se mostrassi un po' di rispetto.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed14=Non pensate di aver visto tutto quello che so fare. Il meglio deve ancora venire.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected00=Mi è concessa un'altra occasione.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected01=Ti sono grato.

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec00=Saggia mossa.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec01=Molto intrigante.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec02=Dunque è questo il piano.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec03=Strategico.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec04=Ne farò buon uso.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt00=Ti comporti come se appartenessi a una civiltà... meno progredita.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt01=Se non ti uccide la tua stupidità, saranno le mie lame a farlo.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt02=La mia meditazione è conclusa. La tua è mai iniziata?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/TeamKilled00=Questa non è che l'oscurità che precede l'alba.

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Harak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Gift00=Presto volentieri il mio aiuto.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Lockin00=È giunto il nostro momento.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Purchase00=Combattiamo per una causa comune!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial00=Un Templare non si sottrae mai all'addestramento.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial01=Accetto la sfida.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Dobbiamo tutti valutare le nostre azioni in questo reame.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Vedo che non agisci avventatamente. È ammirevole.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Il tempo della contemplazione è finito.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=La battaglia infuria. Non indugiamo!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used00=Lancia di Adun, aprite il fuoco!

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Puntano al nostro forte. Intercettiamoli.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendTower00=Non lasciate che prendano questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_KillHero00=Dobbiamo abbattere quel fuoriclasse.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed00=Come butta?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed01=Yo, palla al balzo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed02=Ehi, mi stai facendo ammosciare.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed03=Giù la testa e pensa a giocare.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed04=C'è una sola regola nella Fulgor Infernale. Da' il meglio, o la sconfitta sarà... bruciante.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed05=I playoff tra la Fulgor Infernale e la Virtus Celeste durano da eoni. Al termine della stagione, faremo meglio a eliminare quella regola dei due punti.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed06=Ehi, Diablo. Questa volta sono io il demone partita! <evil laugh>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed07=La corte è riunita, mortali. E io sono il giudice, la giuria e il boia.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed08=E adesso chi è tutto un fuoco, Imperius? Ah ah ah.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed09=Mamma, butta la pasta!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed10=Prima, distruggo il tabellone. Poi, distruggo il tuo mondo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed11=Perché combattiamo per il controllo di Sanctuarium? È che là si tengono le finali, e tutti preferiscono giocare in casa.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed12=Sono stanco dei Nefilim e delle loro schiacciate arroganti. Ai miei tempi, toccava sudare sui fondamentali!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed13=Malthael era uno degli assi nella manica della Virtus Celeste. Per fortuna ha cambiato squadra.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed14=Ti confido un segreto. Il mio talento non dipende dalle scarpe. Io, ehm... non riesco a infilarle.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed15=Una volta hanno fatto una marca di cereali con la mia faccia. Poi i bambini non volevano più fare colazione. Chissà perché...
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB00=Teniamoli d'occhio.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB01=Non aspettarti dei passaggi. <chuckle>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB02=Ricorda lo schema.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Resurrected00=Sono di nuovo in partita.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Resurrected01=È solo un graffio. Ci sono.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Revive00=Di nuovo in partita.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Revive01=Mister, sono pronto.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Revive02=È il momento del contropiede.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting00=Dalla distanza!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting01=Da tre!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting02=Tiro...
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting03=Prova a stoppare questa!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting04=Partito.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec00=Fiiico.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec01=Come vuoi, mister.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec02=Questo ci darà una marcia in più.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec03=Nessuno se lo aspetterà.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec04=Ah, grande.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt00=Come fai a fermarmi, se non riesci a vedermi?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt01=Qui io gioco in casa.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt02=Chi ha portato questa spazzatura sul mio campo?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/TeamKilled00=La prossima volta voglio vedere delle mosse degne di questo nome.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_ExLocked00=Benvenuti sul campo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_ExPurchased00=Facciamo un'altra partita?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Gift00=Tu osi cedermi? Bah, tanto questa squadra non mi è mai piaciuta.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Lockin00=Diamoci dentro!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Purchase00=Prima scelta.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Trial00=Resta di stucco. È un azmotrucco.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ho studiato un nuovo schema mentre aspettavo. Si chiama "piantala di perdere tempo e fammi giocare".
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used00=Zona calda!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used01=Centro perfetto!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used02=Attenti al conto alla rovescia.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Yes06=Vado a canestro.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Yes07=Scatto in attacco.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/AI_Heal01=Rammenda la tua debole carne.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/AI_Retreat00=<angry exertion> Devo ripiegare.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/AI_Retreat01=Devo curarmi...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/AI_Uhoh00=Cosa?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/AI_Uhoh01=Adesso ci penso io!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/AI_Uhoh02=Che insolenza!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack00=Ribelle insignificante!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack01=Assaggiate la mia ira!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack02=La vostra fine è inevitabile!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack03=Sarà un bagno di sangue!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack04=Vi divorerò.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack05=Nessuno può opporsi a me!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack06=Io vi sfido!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Celebrate00=Spassoso...

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Healed02=Molto avveduto.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroAgree00=Mmm... 
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroAgree01=Concordo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroAgree02=Solo perché mi compiace.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroBoast00=Il Peccato dominerà su tutto!

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion00=Ti sei preparato per la guerra?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion01=Sei pronto ad assediare il nemico?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Angel00=Hmm, stanco di stare dalla parte dei perdenti?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Chen00=Che cos'è quel liquido che continui a ingurgitare?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Ma guarda chi c'è: il nefilim...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Hmm, da che girone dell'Inferno vieni tu?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Tu... Vedo che oggi partecipano cani e porci.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Sembri pronto per la guerra.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Prime00=Dobbiamo conquistare questo mondo e tenercelo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroRespond00=Non vedevo l'ora.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroRespond01=Io detengo il potere dell'Inferno.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroRespond02=Stai cercando di tentarmi?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Agree00=<reuses introresponse00_04>
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=Fatico a chiamare "combattere" quello che fai.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Che essere insignificante.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Annoyed00=Stai scherzando col fuoco!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Chen00=Non sei il gioielliere del nefilim, tu?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=La tua morte sarà più dolce dopo questo diversivo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=La tua carne era destinata a morire.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Dal suono sembri uno dei caduti.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Non mi fai ridere.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Vieni, voglio vederli soffrire.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Prime00=Tu ci hai condotto solo alla rovina, fratello! Farò a modo mio.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill00=Insolente...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill01=Che essere insignificante.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill02=<dark laughter>
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill03=Il male ti si ritorce contro.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill04=Lo sapevo che eri debole...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillButcher00=Macellaio... macellato
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillD3Hero00=Sapevo che prima o poi ti avrei annientato, nefilim.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillDiablo00=Consideralo un esilio permanente.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Banchetterò con il tuo orgoglio.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillTyrael00=Starai benissimo accanto a Inarius.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillUther00=Mi sa tanto che la tua "Luce" si è spenta.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Laugh00=<dark laugh>
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowLifeHeal00=Oh... oh sì.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowLifeHeal01=Molto appagante.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ottimo servigio.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowMana00=Sto esaurendo il mana.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowMana01=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowMana02=Non ho abbastanza mana.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/MatchEnd00=Che cos'è che devo dire?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/MatchEnd01=Che cos'è che devo dire?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/MatchEnd02=Che cos'è che devo dire?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/No01=Non posso.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/No02=Un comando senza senso.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Aiutate il nostro alleato.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Venite a me.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Combattete per me.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Distruggiamo il nucleo del nemico!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Soggioghiamo quei mercenari.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Distruggete questo forte!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Prendete questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Difendete questo forte.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Difendete questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_KillHero00=Quest'imbecille interferisce con i miei piani.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed00=Non tentarmi, mortale.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed01=Presto finirete tutti ai miei piedi.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed02=Ti stai spingendo troppo oltre, o forse non abbastanza.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed03=Ah, era da Rocca Bastione che non mi sentivo così sicuro di me!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed04=Se credi che la mia forma attuale sia impressionante, aspetta di vedere la testa sospesa che uso per sfottere il nemico! <evil laugh>
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed05=Comandare le Ancelle del Peccato non è mica facile. Accidia è sempre in ritardo, Ira è ostile, Superbia crede che Avarizia rubi, Invidia è gelosa del fatto che Avarizia la faccia franca, e Gola cerca di mangiarsi tutte le altre. Quanto a Lussuria, be'... lei è una VERA fonte di distrazione.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed06=<snoring> Nefilim e cherubini... Qui! Là! Dappertutto! <wakes up an growls> Quei maledetti nefilim mi tormentano anche quando dormo!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed07=Servi, ricordate che non c'è niente di più tossico o letale di un bambino nefilim. Basta un tocco per morire.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed08=No, non so se la Signora della Lussuria riceve su appuntamento.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed09=Ho un diavolo per capello, quindi vediamo di proseguire.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed10=Ti lamenti della tua famiglia? Io sono cresciuto fra i Signori dell'Inferno. Le nostre zuffe da piccoli hanno devastato interi mondi. 
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed11=Chi crede che esistano solo sette vizi capitali ha poca immaginazione.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed12=Questa cosa inizia a fare più male dei miei piercing.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed13=Un momento di attenzione, per favore. Devo scrivere una serie di libri su questa battaglia e poi passare un po' di tempo a disseminarli in giro!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed14=Cosa? Come ti permetti di darmi del maligno "minore"! Preferisco definirmi "diversamente maggiore".
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed15=<growl> Sono seriamente tentato di mandarti al diavolo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB00=Vai.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB01=Distruggi.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB02=Vai, servo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB03=Uccidi!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB04=Uccidi nel mio nome.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB05=Ora!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Resurrected00=Finalmente sono tornato!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Resurrected01=La mia vittoria è certa.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive00=Un Signore dell'Inferno non muore mai!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive01=Nessuno può fermarmi!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive02=Solo un contrattempo.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec00=Deliziosa.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec01=Sarà divertente...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec02=Il mio trionfo attende.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec03=Intrigante...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec04=Il potere scorre attraverso me!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt00=Il tuo destino è segnato!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt01=La tua insolenza non sarà tollerata!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt02=Perdonami, perché sto per peccare.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/TeamKilled00=Una vuota vittoria. Saremo noi a trionfare alla fine!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExLocked00=Sono io il vero Signore dell'Inferno!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Dove si nascondono i nemici?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Gift00=Sono certo che mi adorerà.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Lockin00=Ecco l'inizio!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Purchase00=Una scelta astuta.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Trial00=Contempla la potenza dell'Inferno.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Trial01=Vorresti stringere un patto con me?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Le armate dell'Inferno sono inquiete.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Hai mai considerato i piaceri del peccato?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Sì... Beati al solo vedermi.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ho voglia di battaglia e di sangue fresco...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used00=Credete di sapere cosa sia il dolore?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used01=Affogate nella marea del peccato!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used02=Avete paura della fine?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used00=<laughs> Pensavi di essere così in gamba...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used01=Devastate questo mondo!

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Yes03=Molto bene.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Yes04=La battaglia infuria.

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/AI_Retreat00=Un po' troppo rischioso per i miei gusti.

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroAgree00=Parole sante.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Ho combattuto con un tuo parente in passato?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Quindi, in quest'epoca, tu saresti un eroe?

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Meno male che c'è qualcuno che capisce qualcosa qui.

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/LowLifeHeal02=Mi arriverà la parcella?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/LowMana00=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/No00=Ti sembra che possa farlo?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Sarà meglio dare una mano prima che finisca in tragedia.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Posso fare molte cose da solo, ma non questo!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Colpiamoli dove fa più male... no, non lì. Nel nucleo.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Avanti, prendete quel campo di mercenari.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Razziamo e saccheggiamo questo forte, amici.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Andate a prendere quella torre!

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed00=Chi ti credi di essere, Tomator?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed01=Ah, se non fossi dall'altra parte dello schermo, io ti...
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed02=Ho una faretra piena di spade, e so come lanciarle.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed03=Sì, sono l'Implacabile. Qualche problema?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed04=Un attimo, i migliori navigatori del mondo sono vichinghi? Ragazzi, è evidente che stiamo sbagliando qualcosa...
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Resurrected00=Be', almeno in questo gioco ho vite infinite.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Revive00=Sono tornato, ragazzi!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Revive01=Ma chi ci ammazza, a noi vichinghi?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Revive02=Quante vite ci rimangono?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Spec00=Sì, per noi va bene.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Spec01=Ah, sarà divertente.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Taunt00=Tua madre era un criceto e tuo padre puzzava più di Olaf.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/UI_ExLocked00=Vichinghi, adunata!

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/What05=Che c'è?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/What_Evo00=Sì?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/WorthIt00=Eh, c'eravamo quasi.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Yes00=Le mie spade sono affilate.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Yes01=Saccheggiare, depredare, dare fuoco a tutto.

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Yes06=Va bene, andiamo.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_Attack00=Attaccate ora! Il nemico è debole!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_Attack01=Ora li abbattiamo!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_Attack02=Il nemico vacilla! Scatenate la vostra furia!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_Caution00=Attenzione, il nemico è vicino.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_GoodJob00=Un colpo possente!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_GoodJob01=Bravo! Polverizziamoli!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_GoodJob02=Ah! Un bel combattimento!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_Heal00=Sei ferito. Vai a una fonte curativa, presto.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_Heal01=Curati, prima di morire dissanguato.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_Retreat00=Sono costretta a ritirarmi.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_Retreat01=Devo ritirarmi, ma tornerò!

VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Ci sono due nefilim... Vuol dire che le creature dell'Inferno sono più forti?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Sappi questo, demone. Dopo la battaglia... ti distruggerò.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Un attimo, ma è un pesce quello? Avete un pesce in squadra?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Hmm... sei tu.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Felice di vederti, amico.

VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroRespond02=Metti alla prova la mia fermezza, se desideri.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=<laughs> Le mie lame sperano di sì...
VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroResponse_Demon00=Fatti gli affari tuoi, essere demoniaco.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroResponse_Murky00=Non farò finta di aver capito.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroResponse_Negative00=Chiudi il becco. Abbiamo uno scontro da vincere.

VoiceOver/Barbarian/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Ridurremo a brandelli chiunque ci si opponga.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Kill00=Che liberazione.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Kill01=Ucciderti non mi dà alcuna soddisfazione.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Kill02=Ne ho avuto abbastanza di te.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Kill03=La battaglia è vinta.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Kill04=La tua carne è debole!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillAzmodan00=Il regno del peccato è finito.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillD3Hero00=Ah, ah! Mi piace una bella rissa.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillDiablo00=Questo è per Leah!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillMagicUser00=Odio sporcarmi le mani col lurido sangue degli stregoni!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillSpreeEnd00=A quanto pare, vado oltre le tue possibilità.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillStitches00=E mettiti qualche straccio addosso.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillVarian00=Ti preferivo quand'eri Lo'gosh.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillWarrior00=Hai combattuto bene, guerriero!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillZertatul00=Solo i codardi si nascondono nell'ombra.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowLifeHeal00=Grazie, riprendo le forze.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowLifeHeal01=Mi hai salvato la vita... Ti sono grata.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowLifeHeal02=Sarò per sempre in debito con te.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowMana00=La furia non basta.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowMana01=Mi serve furia.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowMana02=Non ho abbastanza furia.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/MatchEnd00=Che cos'è che devo dire?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/MatchEnd01=Che cos'è che devo dire?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/MatchEnd02=Che cos'è che devo dire?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/No00=Mai.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/No01=È impossibile, non insistere.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/No02=Non posso.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AssistHero00=Un alleato ha bisogno d'aiuto.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AssistMe00=Mi serve aiuto!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AssistMe01=Presto, aiutatemi!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AttackCastle00=Distruggiamo il nucleo del nemico!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AttackMerc00=Sarà meglio prendere questo campo di mercenari.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Questo forte dev'essere distrutto!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AttackTower00=Dovremmo conquistare questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Difendete questo forte.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_DefendTower00=Dobbiamo difendere questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_KillHero00=Uccidete subito quest'eroe!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed00=Perché mi dai noia?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed01=Scegli con cura le tue prossime parole.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed02=Giuro che il prossimo che mi chiama "Barbie" su Battle.net si becca un'ascia nel cranio.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed03=Bul-Kathos, non ti ho mai chiesto niente, non sono brava a pregare. Nessuno ricorda perché combattiamo, né perché moriamo. Conta solo che siamo cinque contro cinque. Ora ti supplico, concedimi un'unica grazia. Migliora il mio DPS! E se non mi ascolti, VA' ALL'INFERNO!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed04=Vediamo... Schiacciare i nemici... fatto. Inseguirli mentre fuggono... naturalmente. Sentire i lamenti delle femmine... Eh, questa la saltiamo.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed05=Tu! Morte per snu snu!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed06=Magari gli uomini preferiscono le bionde, ma le rosse hanno più carattere.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed07=Donna nana, tutta mana. Donna fulva, tutta vu... Ma chi le scrive 'ste battute? Un maniaco?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed08=Continuo a uccidere, ma non trovo mai uno straccio di bottino. Questo gioco non ha senso.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed09=Mai avuto quell'incubo in cui ti ritrovi al lavoro in mutande? È la storia della mia vita.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed10=Se scopro chi ha inventato il bikini in maglia di ferro, giuro che gli slogo la mascella.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed11=Da giovane uno mi chiese in sposa. Gli domandai cosa si aspettava che facessi. "Accetta" mi dice. Così gliel'ho piantata in fronte.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed12=Sai una cosa... Erano anni che sognavo un PvP come si deve.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed13=Aspetta, aspetta che me lo scrivo... Clic col destro movimento e clic col destro attacco... A cos'è che serviva il clic col sinistro? Uh, odio imparare nuove configurazioni di comandi.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed14=C'è un detto, fra la mia gente: "Quando nevica, mettiti il perizoma pesante."

VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillDwarf00=Bah... Ci sono nani che proprio non reggono.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillLiLi00=Non male, Li Li! Tirati su che riproviamo.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillRexxar00=Ti sei un po' arrugginito, eh Rexxar?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSamuro00=Ne uccide più la pinta che la spada.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSkeletonKing00=Ehi, dovresti proprio mettere un po' di ciccia su quelle ossa!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Ogni cosa ha una fine.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Laugh00=<laugh>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ehi, grazie... Me l'ero vista brutta.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ahh, mi sento molto meglio.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal02=<chuckle> Fortuna che ci sei tu.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana00=Mi berrei volentieri qualcosa.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana01=Credo sia il momento di bere qualcosa.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana02=A chi va una bevuta? Oh, a me!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No00=Non credo.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No01=Stavolta no, amico.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No02=E come dovrei fare?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Svelti, un alleato ha bisogno d'aiuto.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Uhm, mi servirebbe una mano!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Aiutatemi, amici!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Attacchiamo il nucleo nemico!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Conquistiamo questo campo di mercenari.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Distruggete questo forte!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Dovremmo conquistare questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Dovremmo difendere questo forte.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Dobbiamo difendere questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_KillHero00=Qualcuno vuol togliere di mezzo quest'eroe?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed00=Ehilà!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed01=Cosa bolle in pentola?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed02=Accentua il positivo. Elimina il negativo.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed03=Oh, sì... Ne ho di storie da raccontare. Vuoi sentirne una? <beat> Fanno nove e novantanove al minuto.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed04=Uno strano vecchio una volta mi disse, "Rimani assetato, amico." <pleh> Pessimo consiglio! <SFX: Sips his drink> Ahh!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed05=La birra fatta in casa è la migliore, perché te la puoi scolare subito!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed06=Sai, se passi da quelle parti, fai un salto alla Birreria Triplo Malto. Pare che lì abbiano sempre bisogno di una mano.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed07=Dice il saggio, "Una tazza vuota attende solo di essere colmata." <SFX: tapping on the side of a cup> <clears throat> Ahem.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed08=È importante essere in grado di reggere quel che si beve.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed09=Oh, e bere molta acqua. Anche quello è importante.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed10="Non tutti coloro che si smarriscono sono perduti..." Cioè, vero, io mi sono perso... ma mi sa che sono l'unico.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed11=Per alcuni il viaggio corrisponde alla destinazione.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed12=La via del viandante è osservare... attingere alle culture degli altri. Quindi prendere quelle conoscenze e vivere una vita beata. Quella dell'Oscuro Viandante, invece... Be'... diciamo solo che finisce male.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed13=Chiedersi perché combattiamo, è come chiedersi perché giochi a Heroes of the Storm. Per fare esperienza. Forse la domanda da porsi è un'altra.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed14=Chen Triplo Malto, Mastro Birraio. Chiedi di me, non accontentarti delle imitazioni!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split00=Sì?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split01=Udiamo il richiamo.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split02=Earth: "Aspetta... io sono Terra, e lui è Fuoco... Tu non dovresti essere Aria?" Fire: "La tua teoria fa acqua da tutte le parti!"
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split03=Fire: "Per noi, ogni uccisione è tripla."
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split04=Storm: "Continua così e ti ritrovi in grossi guai, ragazzino."
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split05=Storm: "Si può dire..." Fire: "Che chi fa da sé..." Earth: "Ci lascia lo zampino!" Storm: "<sigh> Sai una cosa, vattene via... Per un po' non voglio neanche vederti."
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Resurrected00=Sono in debito con te.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Resurrected01=<excited exertion> Te ne devo una.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive00=Va bene... Ci sono! Ci sono!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive01=Ahia! Mi fa ancora male!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive02=Presto, ho la gola secca.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec00=Ehi, mi piace!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec01=Non male, non male.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec02=L'esperienza conduce alla forza.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec03=<laugh> Magnifica!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec04=Antico segreto pandaren, eh?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt00=Scateniamoci!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt01=Ehi, tu! Fammi vedere che sai fare!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt02=Ti faccio fuori a zampe nude! <laugh>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Split00=Storm: "Scateniamoci!"
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Split01=Fire: "Ehi, tu! Facci vedere che sai fare!"
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Split02=Earth: "Ti facciamo fuori a zampe nude!" <laughs>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/TeamKilled00=Non perdetevi d'animo. Li batteremo presto.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_ExLocked00=Ehi, ciao!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah, bentornato, amico.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Gift00=Oh, gli darò un abbraccione da parte tua.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Lockin00=Scateno il panda-monio!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Purchase00=Ottima decisione, amico mio!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Trial00=Oh, siamo interessati a imparare il Triplo Malto Fu, eh?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Trial01=È sempre saggio provare prima di acquistare.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Prenditi tutto il tempo che serve. Perché se non ce lo prendiamo, come facciamo ad averne?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Hai un'aria familiare. Ci siamo già visti a Pandaria?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ti va un altro round? No? Bene, intanto mi bevo qualcosa.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Oh no. La birra si sta scaldando... Odio quando succede.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used00=Tempesta. Terra. Fuoco! Udite il mio richiamo!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used01=Gli elementi odono il mio richiamo.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate2Used00=È ora di distruggere!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate2Used01=<sniff> Mmm, dovrei pulire più spesso questo barile.

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Sagge parole come sempre, mio loquace amico.

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Altrettanto, Tyrael.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=Proprio io. Nessuno ti giudica se non riesci a stare al passo, paladino. È solo che la tua classe è sorpassata.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Sì... Non funziona esattamente così.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill00=Che Akarat abbia pietà di te, perché io non l'avrò!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill01=La crociata ti reclama!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill02=Almeno ci hai provato.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill03=Alla prossima.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill04=Che sfortuna, eh?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillAngel00=Tornatene in Paradiso!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillButcher00=Gli spiriti dei morti sono vendicati.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDeckard00=Mi dispiace, vecchio amico. Forse avresti dovuto parlare di meno.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDemon00=In questo mondo non puoi nasconderti da me, demone!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiablo00=A quante volte siamo, Diablo? Ho perso il conto.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiabloHero00=La tua ora è giunta, eroe. 
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillImperius00=Aspettavo da tempo questo momento, fanfarone.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillLeoric00=Tornatene nelle tue segrete, Leoric.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillMephisto00=Ma tu non dovevi essere quello intelligente?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillNephalem00=Le mie scuse, Nefilim.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Adesso basta!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillTyrael00=È l'era dei Nefilim, amico mio.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillUther00=Paladini. Ah!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillWhitemane00=Una fanatica in meno.

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal00=C'è mancato poco!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ben fatto, guaritore.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal02=Sarà meglio andarci cauti.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana00=Non ho abbastanza mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana01=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana02=Mi serve più mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No01=Non posso.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No02=Non ora.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Un alleato ha bisogno d'aiuto!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Mi serve aiuto!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Il vostro aiuto potrebbe farmi comodo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Al nucleo nemico! L'ora è giunta!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Stringiamo amicizia con questi mercenari.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Distruggiamo questo forte!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Conquistiamo questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Il nucleo deve resistere!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Schieratevi accanto a questo forte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Difendete questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_KillHero00=Quell'eroe dev'essere abbattuto, e presto.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed00=Salve.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed01=Sì? Che cosa ti serve?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed02=Perché clicchi su di me anziché sui nemici o sul bottino? Che razza di gioco è questo?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed03=Battute? Ti aspetti battute di spirito? Ok, ci proverò.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed04=Un crociato, un paladino e un templare entrano in un bar. E tutti prendono qualcosa da bere. Ah ah!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed05=...non tutti trovano divertente l'umorismo dei crociati.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed06=Un giorno terminerò di purificare la chiesa di Zakarum e la crociata terminerà. Che cosa farò dopo? Potrei andare in crociera...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed07=Questo Nexus mi fa uno strano effetto agli occhi. Forse è il modo in cui si riflette la luce...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed08=La cosa più importante quando si indossa un'armatura pesante è non pensare MAI al prurito... Oh oh, me la sono cercata...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed09=Oh, Akarat, benedici questo sacro flagello di modo che possa ridurre i nemici in pezzettini piccoli piccoli. Sia fatta la tua volontà. Così sia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed10=Porto il nome della mia maestra, come lei portava il nome della sua. Un giorno la mia apprendista porterà il mio, e la sua apprendista porterà il suo dopo di lei. Ah... ma quindi ci chiamiamo tutte allo stesso modo...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed11=Il nostro ordine è composto da molte persone disseminate per tutte le terre conosciute. Diciamo che è un ordine sparso.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed12=Un tizio ieri mi ha presa per un templare. Gli ho chiesto: "Mi hai mai sentita urlare 'Glorioso!'?" Mi ha risposto: "Ora sì." Era arguto, peccato che ora sia morto.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed13=Clicca su di me un'altra volta e giuro su Akarat che ti stacco il dito o qualsiasi altra cosa tu stia usando su quel mouse.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected00=Ti sono grata, amico.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected01=Ti ringrazio.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive00=Sono tornata!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive01=Si torna a combattere.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive02=Mi dovrei davvero trovare un'apprendista.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec00=Bella scelta.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec01=Eccellente.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec02=Mi rafforzo nella Luce.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec03=Com'è giusto che sia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec04=Sì, niente male...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt00=Se avete dei veri eroi, mandateli da me.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt01=Non dureresti a lungo nella crociata.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt02=Potrebbe sconfiggerti persino la mia apprendista. E neanche ce l'ho!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/TeamKilled00=Mi sono ripresa da situazioni peggiori. Non perdete la speranza.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExLocked00=Salve, amico.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Un vecchio amico fa ritorno.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Gift00=Hai uno spirito generoso.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Lockin00=La crociata chiama.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Purchase00=Una scelta saggia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial00=Beh, facciamo una prova, no?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial01=Desideri unirti alla crociata?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Valuti le tue azioni prima di prendere impegni. Molto saggio.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Sei un tipo accorto.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=La crociata ci chiama, amico.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ah... L'immobilità ha un certo suo fascino, ma quando è troppo è troppo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate1Used00=Che l'ira divina cali su di voi.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used00=La fede è il mio scudo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used01=Non andrete oltre!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used02=Alt!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used03=Ecco, prendete.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used04=Finisce ora.

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes03=Akarat lo vuole.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes04=Ma certo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes05=Sono d'accordo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes06=Perché no?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes07=La crociata chiama.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes08=Io vado.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack00=Adesso! Attacchiamo!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack01=Dobbiamo attaccare finché sono deboli!

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob00=Lok'tar!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob01=Colpo eccellente.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob02=Ahahah!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Heal00=Quella ferita è profonda. Vai a una fonte curativa, presto.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Heal01=Stai per morire. Vedi di fare qualcosa.

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroAgree00=Sì!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroAgree01=Il mio scudo è tuo!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroAgree02=Sono con te!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroBoast00=I nostri nemici contempleranno la distruzione che abbiamo seminato!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroBoast01=È il momento di spezzare qualche osso.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion00=Siete pronti?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion01=I tamburi di guerra stanno suonando! Preparatevi!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=Alleanza. Bah.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_AurielSpirit00=Combatto accanto a uno spirito guaritore. A questa non ci crederà nessuno.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Le tue sembianze sono umane, ma... Mmm, ti terrò d'occhio.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Un demone? Che peccato. Speravo di avere alleati che almeno ogni tanto vincono.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil00=I Cantaguerra non si alleano con il male.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Non sei alla mia altezza. Stammi alla larga.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil02=Tu? Che gli antenati mi salva...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Garrosh. Non tutti i Cantaguerra sono disposti a seguire la tua follia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Gazlowe00=Sparachiodi? Ah. Almeno ci divertiremo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good00=Tu stai con i buoni, vero? Me lo farò andar bene.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good01=Mi fa piacere trovare qualche guerriero onorevole.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good02=Ah, sei tu. Mi può andare bene.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Lok'tar!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_JunkratGoblin00=Stammi dietro e fa' saltare in aria qualsiasi cosa ci sbarri la strada.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Un altro dei servi di Sylvanas, immagino.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Un attimo, siete in tre? Pensate di riuscire a starmi dietro?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Un murloc! Quant'era bello calciarvi in acqua! Oh, scusami.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Sono stanca di avere alleati deboli.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Mi sembri forte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Capoguerra Thrall. È un onore.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Ricordo le armature di Lordaeron, Paladino. I Cantaguerra non hanno dimenticato i vostri campi.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Whitemane00=Uno Zelota Scarlatto? Che schifo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Yrel00=Una Draenei? Questa non me l'aspettavo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond00=Lok'tar ogar!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond01=Sento già la furia nel mio sangue.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond02=Quando i cancelli si apriranno, vedrai.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Non preoccuparti, verme dell'Alleanza. L'Orda vincerà questa battaglia anche per te.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Angry00=Spezzerò ogni osso del tuo corpo!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_AurielSpirit00=Uno spirito guaritore? Non sono morta, vero?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Butcher00=<Growls back>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Confused00=Che cos'è stato? Qualcuno ha parlato?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Non ti conosco, e non m'importa farlo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Demon00=Gli Orchi ne hanno abbastanza della tua razza, demone.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Non mi serve la tua opinione, poppante.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil00=Taci, lo scontro sta per cominciare. Con te me la vedrò dopo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil01=Me ne ricorderò quando saremo avversari.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil02=Sono qui per combattere il nemico, non te. Però...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Excited00=Eccellente!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Almeno su questo sono d'accordo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Gazlowe00=Stanca e infastidita!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good00=È sempre bello combattere con guerrieri di cui ci si può fidare.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good01=L'onore sarà il nostro scudo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good02=Forza.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Horde00=Per l'Orda!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_JunkratGoblin00=Stai scherzando? Sai che potrei spaccarti la faccia, vero?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Chi è morto perché tu diventassi re?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=Che cos'è un "Tomator"? Si mangia?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Murky00=E poi dicono che è difficile capire l'Orchesco.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Negative00=E fa' silenzio.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_No00=Sei fuori di testa? Certo che no.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Positive00=Bene, era tanto che aspettavo una vera sfida!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Ah, certo.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Lok narash!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Uther00=Dacci un taglio, nemmeno io faccio i salti di gioia.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Continua pure, pelle rosa. Non vedo l'ora di rimettere i cani dell'Alleanza al loro posto.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Yrel00=Quanta nobiltà d'animo. Sta' zitta e combatti, Draenei.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill00=Sangue e tuono!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill01=È stato magnifico.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill02=Ho combattuto molto meglio.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill03=Cos'è stato? Bah!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill04=Un altro! Portatemene un altro!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill05=Ossa spezzate dall'acciaio.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillAlliance00=Feccia dell'Alleanza.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillAngel00=Questi spiriti guaritori stanno diventando aggressivi.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillChogall00=Ecco cosa meritano i traditori! Tutti e due!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillCrusader00=Quell'umana aveva la mia faccia? Mi sa che ho le traveggole.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillDemon00=Sembra che la Legione Infuocata abbia bisogno di nuove reclute.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillDwarf00=Alterac appartiene ai Lupi Bianchi!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillGuldan00=Ti meriteresti un destino molto peggiore, Stregone.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillHorde00=Muori con onore, guerriero dell'Orda.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillLeoric00=Torna presto, così posso ucciderti di nuovo!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillNephalem00=Sorprendentemente forte... per un essere umano.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillNightElf00=Ah! La testa di un Elfo! Najak ne sarà felice!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillSpreeEnd00=Furia omicida terminata, poppante!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillSylvanas00=Non sei la mia Capoguerra...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillUther00=Paladini. Bah.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillWarchief00=Pensavo che sarebbe stato più difficile uccidere un Capoguerra.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillWhitemane00=Isterica presuntuosa.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh01=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh02=<large laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh03=<aggressive laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal00=Ah, sì!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal01=Le mie forze ritornano!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal02=Grazie. Ora torniamo a combattere!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana00=Non ho abbastanza mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana01=Mi serve più mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana02=Scherzi? Sono esausta!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd00=La vittoria è mia!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd01=Servo con onore.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd02=È stato un onore.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No00=Ah, no.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No01=Impossibile.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No02=Non hai qualcosa di meglio da fare?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistHero00=Un alleato è nei guai!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistMe00=Prestatemi aiuto!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistMe01=Ho bisogno d'aiuto!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackCastle00=Dritti al cuore! Abbattiamo il nucleo!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackMerc00=Piegate questi mercenari al nostro volere.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Attacchiamo questo forte insieme!

VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed03=L'addestramento non mi aveva preparata a tutte queste... toccatine.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed04=La vuoi piantare?

VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed12=<disgusted exertion> Ma quanti devo ucciderne per trovare un leggendario? Be', immagino che uno in più non guasti.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed13=I demoni hanno devastato il mio villaggio, l'hanno dato alle fiamme e mi hanno lasciata lì a morire... Cerco solo di rendere il favore.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed14=<sigh> Sarebbe tutto più facile con un seguace al mio fianco... Kormac, dove Diablo sei?

VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_WaitLocked00=La mia caccia deve continuare.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_WaitLocked01=Non vuoi aiutarmi a ottenere vendetta?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ho voglia di combattere. Non dovremmo metterci in coda?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_WaitPurchased01=<sigh> La parte peggiore della caccia è l'attesa.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Ultimate1Used00=Che gli Inferi Fiammeggianti v'inghiottano!
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Ultimate1Used01=Cala la vendetta!
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Ultimate2Used00=La morte vi attende!

VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana00=Sto esaurendo il mana.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana01=Il mio mana scarseggia.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Questa torre di guardia non resisterà a lungo senza di noi.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_KillHero00=Dovremmo abbattere quest'eroe.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed00=Io sono la prima delle driadi.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed01=Alla foresta non serve protezione, ma a te sì.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed02=Riprenderemo ciò che i mortali hanno rubato.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed03=Mio padre Cenarius è potente. Ma io sono determinata.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed04=Non fraintendermi... I mortali sono bravi ad ammazzarsi fra loro. Ma le creature selvatiche se la cavano ancora meglio.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed05=Le piante del Giardino del Terrore hanno qualcosa di strano... Che cosa usano come fertilizzante? 
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed06=Le driadi non si imboscano. Cosa te lo fa pensare? 
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed07=A dire il vero, mangio solo cibo biologico. Con tutte le schifezze che i goblin hanno lasciato nella nostra terra...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed08=Si potrebbe dire che sono una forza della natura.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed09=Va' a giocare fuori, ti dicevano... Non c'è alcun pericolo, ti dicevano... Immagino che non sapessero della mia esistenza.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed10=È passato un sacco di tempo, ma il richiamo per umani continua sempre a dare i suoi frutti.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed11=Ah, le bellezze della natura selvaggia: i veleni, i rovi e i deliziosi rampicanti assassini! Resterei a osservarli tutto il giorno.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed12=Sono partita! Cioè, NELLA partita. Tra gli umani e la foresta, il bene contro il male. O forse solo rossi contro blu.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed13=Senti, non ho scelto io di chiamarmi Lunara. Mio padre ha voluto darmi il nome di mia nonna. Sempre legato al passato, il mio vecchio...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed14=Chiamami Mylune e ti prendo a calci con gli zoccoli anteriori e quelli posteriori.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed15=La maggior parte delle driadi parla perfettamente cerviano, conigliese e uccellese, ma io parlo anche serpentese, orsino e qualche raro dialetto scorpionesco. <hissing> Hsss. Hss. HSSS!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed16=Non sei mai stato a una festa delle driadi, eh? Scorre più succo di baccaluna che in tutta la Fiera di Lunacupa.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed17=E adesso saltelliamo. Slancio e balzo, slancio e balzo, slancio... e naturalmente balzo.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed18=Avete devastato il vostro territorio, non devasterete il mio!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected00=Ben fatto.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected01=Grazie. Non è ancora finita.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive00=Io sono eterna.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec02=Perfetto.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec03=La natura concede molti doni.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec04=Mi sento già più forte.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt00=Che ti succede? Soffri di allergie? Ah ah ah!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt01=Forse hai conosciuto delle driadi gentili. Be', io non sono come loro.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt02=Sarai un concime perfetto.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/TeamKilled00=Abbatteteci e torneremo a spuntare!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExLocked00=Qualcosa ti intriga, mortale?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Gli alleati della foresta sono i benvenuti.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Gift00=Mi vuoi regalare? Che cosa sono, un mazzo di fiori?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Lockin00=Inizia la caccia!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Purchase00=Che la natura ti benedica!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial00=Uh, va bene.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial01=Basta che non ci mettiamo troppo.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Mi mancano i campi di Kalimdor...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Gli spazi aperti mi chiamano.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ho atteso troppo a lungo.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Se ti aspetti qualche mossetta aggraziata, te la scordi.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used00=Non si sfugge alla natura.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used01=Soffrite, come ha sofferto la terra!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used02=Risolviamo il problema alla radice!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate2Used00=Perché non rallentate un attimo?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate2Used01=La strada si fa accidentata!

VoiceOver/GazloweA/EndingWin02=Woohoo! Sgancia il grano, baby!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/EndingWin03=Sì! La mia parola preferita! <beat> Dopo "soldi", cioè.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/Ending_Blue00=Vince la squadra blu.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/Ending_Red00=Vince la squadra rossa.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/FirstBloodAlly00=Primo sangue!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/FirstBlood_Blue00=La squadra blu ha sparso il primo sangue.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/FirstBlood_Red00=La squadra rossa ha sparso il primo sangue.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/FourKill00=Quattro!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/GameStart00=Che la battaglia abbia inizio.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/GameStart01=Prendetevi a cazzotti. A calci nelle gengive. Come vi pare.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/GameStart02=È l'ora di combattere!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/GameStart03=Colpiteli come se vi dovessero dei soldi!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/Gravestomp00=Nemico bandito.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/Gravestomp_Observer00=Eroe bandito.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroKill00=Oh! Un classico!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroKill01=Sì... ha finito di campare.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroKill02=Ugh, si sta ancora dimenando. Disgustoso.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroKill03=Ehi, vedi di impegnarti.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroKill04=Ehi, non dimenticate di svuotare le tasche. <beat> Che c'è?
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroKill05=Kablammo!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroKill06=Buonanotte!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelect00=Ehi, gente, spero che siate pronti a sfogarvi!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelect01=Lo scontro sta per iniziare. Preparate armi e bagagli.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelectPlayer00=Oh, guardami laggiù. Ciao, me! Chi è una creaturina adorabile? <laugh>Tu!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelectPlayer01=Oh, vuoi che parli mentre combatto, eh? A me sta bene... ma mi paghi il doppio, OK?
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelectPlayer02=Mai avuto una di quelle esperienze extracorporee? No? Be', è strana. Fidati.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelect_Observer00=Va bene, le due squadre si stanno preparando. Oh, sarà uno scontro coi fiocchi.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain00=Ci hai rimesso la ghirba. Te ne farai una ragione.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain01=Cosa? Che mi sono perso? Non stavo guardando.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain02=Oooh, quanto mi dispiace... Posso avere il tuo stereo?
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain03=Offf. Fa male, vero?
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain04=Non c'è problema. Torna al tuo cadavere e... Oh! Santo cielo, è sparito... Be', ti toccherà aspettare.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain05=Ehi, ricordi quando hai tirato le cuoia? Ah già, è appena successo. Come non detto.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain06=Ah, avresti dovuto vedere la tua faccia.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/KeepDestroy00=La fortezza è andata.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/KeepDestroy_Blue00=La squadra blu ha raso al suolo una fortezza.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/KeepDestroy_Red00=La squadra rossa ha raso al suolo una fortezza.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/KeepLost00=Abbiamo perso una fortezza.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/Kill_Observer00=Eroe ucciso.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/MegaKill00=Cinque di fila! Inconcepibile!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy00=Ah ah! Forte distrutto
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy01=Oooh, questo sì che si chiama fare danni materiali.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy02=Bella esplosione! Le darei un 8.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy03=Oh, tanti saluti al forte. Notevole, direi.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy04=Bel colpo, ragazzi. Così si fa.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy_Blue00=La squadra blu ha distrutto un forte.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy_Red00=La squadra rossa ha distrutto un forte.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostLost00=Aww, il nemico ha distrutto un forte.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostLost01=Allora... abbiamo appena perso un forte.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostLost02=Ehi, un forte è andato... Che sfiga.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerAbandon00=Ehi, mi sa che qualcuno ha mollato. Perdente...
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerAbandon01=Bene, uno degli eroi adesso è un robot. Perciò, insomma, buon divertimento.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerAbandon02=(passionless) Oh... no... ti prego, non andartene...
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerRejoin00=Oh, eccoti di nuovo qui... Cosa? Io parlar male di te? Mai.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerRejoin01=Ehi! Guarda chi si rivede! Cos'era, colpa del router? Ti conviene di sì...
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerRejoin02=Huh... Non pensavo che ti avremmo rivisto.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/Revive00=Alleato resuscitato.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/Revive_Observer00=Eroe resuscitato.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeEnd00=Furia omicida terminata. Kaput.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeEnd01=Aww, la furia omicida è terminata.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeEnd02=Quella furia omicida era fantastica, vero? Peccato.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeEnd_Ally00=La furia omicida della nostra squadra è terminata.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeFirstUpgrade00=Furore.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeMax00=Eroe della Tempesta.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeSecondUpgrade00=Massacro.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeStart00=Furia omicida.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeThirdUpgrade00=Intoccabile.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TalentUnlock00=Scegli un talento.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TalentUnlock01=Scegli un talento.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TalentUnlock02=Scegli un talento.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TeamKill00=Ragazzi, sono schiattati tutti.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TeamKill01=Wow, l'intera squadra nemica è stata spazzata via.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TeamKill02=La squadra nemica è defunta. Cosa spacchiamo adesso?
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TeamKill_Blue00=Squadra blu annientata.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TeamKill_Red00=Squadra rossa annientata.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TripleKill00=E fanno tre.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TripleKill01=E fanno tre.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TripleKill02=E fanno tre.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack00=Non esitate! All'attacco!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack01=È la nostra occasione! Colpite!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack02=È il momento! Carica!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack_W00=Azzannateli alla gola!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack_W01=Dategli addosso!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack_W02=Attaccateli ora!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Caution00=Attenti. Qualcosa non quadra.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Caution_W00=Drizzate le orecchie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob00=Un lavoro impressionante.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob01=Forse ti ho sottovalutato.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob02=Sei un alleato di valore.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob_W00=Bella uccisione!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob_W01=Quanta cattiveria.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob_W02=Ferocia ammirevole.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Heal00=Alla fonte curativa! Se muori, non servi a nessuno.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Heal01=Cura le tue ferite!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Heal_W00=Curati, alla svelta!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Heal_W01=Ti devi curare!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Retreat00=Ritiriamoci dietro le fortificazioni!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Retreat01=Dobbiamo ritirarci!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Retreat_W00=Dobbiamo ripiegare!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Retreat_W01=Via di lì, presto!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh00=Abbiamo perso un alleato!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh01=Ci stanno decimando!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh02=Vendichiamo i caduti!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh_W00=No! Abbiamo perso qualcuno!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh_W01=La pagheranno!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh_W02=Osate colpire il mio branco?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack00=Per Gilneas!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack01=Ti seppellirò!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack02=La tua vita è giunta al termine!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack03=È il momento di attaccare!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack04=La vendetta è prossima!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack05=Nessuna tregua!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack06=La vittoria sarà nostra!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W00=Ora tocca a te!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W01=Hai fatto un grave errore!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W02=Nulla mi trattiene!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W03=I Gilneani non si arrendono mai!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W04=Ti seppellirò!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W05=Sono sulle tue tracce!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W06=Non hai scampo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Celebrate00=Ah! Magnifico lavoro.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Celebrate01=E le chiamate fortificazioni?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Comeback00=Guadagniamo terreno!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Comeback_W00=Il nostro branco combatte unito!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Death00=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Death01=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Death02=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Death03=<Death exertion>

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Death_W06=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Death_W07=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed00=Ti sono riconoscente.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed01=Il tuo aiuto giunge al momento giusto.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed02=Sento tornare le forze.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed_W00=Ah, ora va meglio. Ti ringrazio.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed_W01=Pronto a saltare nella mischia!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed_W02=Ti sono grato.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree00=Questa è un'alleanza che approvo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree01=La tua determinazione è impressionante.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree02=Questo branco caccerà bene.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroBoast00=Il nemico rimpiangerà questo giorno.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroBoast01=Con le zanne o con l'acciaio, noi prevarremo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion00=Sarà meglio che vi prepariate.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion01=Pronti per la battaglia?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Hai tradito il tuo popolo, Arthas. Non esiste crimine più grave.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Baelog00=Combatterei con le unghie e con i denti per tornare a casa. E tu?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Erik00=La cosa che desidero di più è che Gilneas risorga.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Kael'thas00=Quel'thalas non è amica di Gilneas. Ma immagino che dovremo collaborare.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Non c'è nulla di peggio di un sovrano non morto.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Lunara00=Non temere, Driade. Sono più in sintonia con la natura che con gli umani.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=Non accetto facilmente l'aiuto altrui, Arcidruido. Ti ringrazio comunque per l'offerta.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=So che a Roccavento quelli come te sono considerati una minaccia.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Preferirei essere solo che avere alleati come te.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Se proprio devo accettare aiuto, sono contento che venga da parte tua.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_RehgarSW00=Stai davvero indossando una pelle di lupo?!?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Pensi che siamo alleati? Quando avremo finito, ucciderò anche te.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Possiamo essere entrambi re, ma io sono il capobranco.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond00=Un vero Gilneano è sempre pronto.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond01=Ho visto molte guerre: questa non sarà diversa.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond02=State a vedere cosa succede quando perdo la pazienza.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Ana00=State a vedere cosa succede quando perdo la pazienza.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Non mettere alla prova la mia pazienza!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Tutto quello che ho fatto l'ho fatto per Gilneas. Tutto quello che tu hai fatto l'hai fatto per te stesso.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Baelog00=Sta' zitto, o vedrai i miei denti da vicino.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Speravo di avere alleati fidati. Invece, immagino che dovrò accontentarmi di te.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Erik00=Sono un WORGEN! W-O-R-G-E-N, worgen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Kael'thas00=La mia gente si è trasformata in worgen, ma tu hai quasi mutato la tua in demoni.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Esperienza in cosa, esattamente? Nel condurre i tuoi sudditi alla rovina o nel farti massacrare da loro?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Lunara00=Ah, la donna che è quasi un cervo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=Oggi ripago il debito che la mia gente ha con te.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=E pensare che una creatura come te può seminare un tale caos...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Se fosse per me, saremmo su campi avversi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=I nostri destini sono intrecciati.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Non ci sono molti altri qui intorno di cui mi fido, sai.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_RehgarSW00=Ah, Rehgar. L'orco che vorrebbe tanto essere un lupo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=E forse accadrà lo stesso alla tua.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Tu ti comporti come un lupo. Io divento un lupo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill00=Cadi dinanzi a me!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill01=Non avevi possibilità.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill02=Muori come un cane.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill03=Ecco un assaggio dell'ospitalità dei Gilneani.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill04=Chi è il prossimo?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas00=Terenas, questa è la mia espiazione.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas_W00=Ho fatto ciò che non riuscì a Terenas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh00=E ora tocca al resto della tua sporca Orda.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh_W00=Lo'gosh non è il lupo di cui devi preoccuparti.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKael'thas00=Tornatene al tuo adorato Pozzo Solare.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKaelthas_W00=Ehi, mi hai sporcato la pelliccia!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric00=Questo è il destino dei sovrani indegni.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric_W00=Non preoccuparti, Leoric. Mi assicurerò di seppellire le tue ossa.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara00=Forse alla natura serve un po' di protezione da parte degli umani.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara_W00=Sembra che la natura abbia favorito me, questa volta.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion00=Le mie scuse, Arcidruido. Andava fatto.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion_W00=Forse avevi ragione, Malfurion. Questo "Aspetto del branco" è pericoloso.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Mi hai quasi fatto perdere le staffe.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpree_W00=Sono io l'alfa!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas00=Giustizia per Liam! Per tutti i Gilneani!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas_W00=Finalmente, il tuo immondo sangue è versato!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther00=Eri un eroe dell'Alleanza... ma non di Gilneas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther_W00=Ho sempre saputo che avrei vissuto più a lungo di te, Uther.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillVarian_W00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W00=Questa è la mia vittima!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W01=Grazie per avermi aiutato ad affilare gli artigli.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W02=Una facile preda.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W03=Ne uccide più la zanna che la spada.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W04=Sono il migliore in ciò che faccio.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh00=<Hearty, good natured laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh01=<Derisive laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh02=<Vindictive laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh03=<Amused, but subdued laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh04=<Nervous laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh05=<Elated laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh06=<laugh>

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh_W07=<Laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh_W08=<Laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh_W09=<Laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal00=Per fortuna ci sei tu.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal01=Finché io sarò in vita, lo sarà anche Gilneas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal02=Intervento quanto mai appropriato. Grazie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W00=C'è mancato poco. Grazie.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W01=Dalle fauci della sconfitta...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W02=Grazie, ti devo la vita.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana00=Non ho abbastanza mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana01=Ho bisogno di più mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana02=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W00=Sto per finire il mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W01=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W02=Devo recuperare mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No00=Mai.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No01=No.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No02=Giammai.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W00=Non posso.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W01=Impossibile.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W02=Mi rifiuto.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Un alleato è in difficoltà!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero_W00=Un membro del branco ha bisogno di noi!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Datemi aiuto!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Raggiungete la mia posizione!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W00=Attaccate con me!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W01=Combattiamo come un tutt'uno!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Facciamola finita! Distruggiamo il nucleo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle_W00=Colpiamoli al cuore! Distruggiamo il nucleo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Prendiamo questo campo e rafforziamo i nostri ranghi!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc_W00=Facciamo vedere a questi mercenari chi comanda.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=È il momento di abbattere il forte nemico.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost_W00=Abbattete quel forte!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Conquistate questa torre!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower_W00=Prendete questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle_W00=Allontanateli dal nucleo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Il nostro forte non deve cadere!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost_W00=Difendete il nostro territorio!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Mantenete la stretta sulla torre di guardia!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower_W00=Non lasciate che prendano la nostra torre!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero00=Riducete il nemico in brandelli!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero_W00=Uccidete!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed00=Sì? Sputa il rospo!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed01=Rivolgiti a me con il giusto tono!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed02=Mi stai facendo arrabbiare. Non ti piacerà se mi arrabbio.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed03=Ho fatto gettare qualcuno in catene per molto meno.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed04=Un tempo feci costruire un'enorme muro per separare la mia gente dal mondo esterno. Me ne stai facendo ricordare il motivo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed05=Dopo aver riconquistato Gilneas, sarà necessario ricostruirla. Mi chiedo se quei Defias siano ancora disponibili...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed06=Mmm? Certo che la spada è solo per fare scena. Ho una pistola, non vedi?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed07=Volevo mettere una testa di lupo sulla bandiera di Gilneas, ma i miei avvocati mi hanno messo in guardia sull'infrazione del copyright.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed08=Il Muro dei Mantogrigio impediva qualsiasi contatto con il mondo esterno. Perché fortunatamente nessuno ad Azeroth è in grado di volare o teletrasportarsi in luoghi sconosciuti...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed09=Questa pistola è un prodotto dell'industria gilneana. È un'arma di un certo calibro.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed10=Siete mai stati al Forte di Zannascura? Quando ero giovane lo frequentavo, ma mi sembra che abbia cambiato gestione...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed11=Gilneas è stata separata dal resto del mondo per vent'anni. Mi perdonerete se non colgo tutte le citazioni di voi giovani.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed12=Luna piena? Stasera? No! Mi trasformerò in un mostro! Nah, scherzo. Posso farlo in qualsiasi momento. E strapparti la gola.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed13=Una volta un Reietto bussò alla porta settentrionale e urlò: "Soffierò con tanta forza da abbattere il vostro muro!" Ci facemmo una bella risata prima di ricoprirlo di catrame bollente. E poi ridemmo ancora di più.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed14=A proposito, sapevate che il Muro dei Mantogrigio è una delle poche cose visibili dalla Distorsione Fatua? È vero!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W00=Che cosa vuoi?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W01=Parla.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W02=Grrr!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W03=Non chiedermi dove va a finire la spada quando mi trasformo. Meglio non saperlo.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W04=Questi "Tauren" non si erano ancora uniti all'Orda quando feci costruire il muro attorno a Gilneas. Quindi sono dei bovini umanoidi? Delle "mucche mannare"? Che assurdità.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W05=Gli elfi della notte furono i primi worgen. Devono sempre essere i primi in tutto.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W06=Nelle profondità del Bosconero, noi worgen ci riuniamo sotto un enorme albero che placa la nostra natura bestiale. È un luogo incantevole, ma sapessi che fetore...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W07=Continua così, e ti troverai a gridare "Al lupo!"
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W08=Se fossi in te starei attento a non svegliare il lupo che dorme...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W09=Sapete, quest'abito è di lana. Si può dire che sono un lupo in veste d'agnello. Siete un pubblico meraviglioso!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W10=Maledette pulci! Ah no, sei ancora tu.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W11=Non ho paura di nulla! A parte... be', del veterinario.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W12=A dire il vero, sono più un tipo da gatti.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W13=Ti avverto: il detto "can che abbaia non morde" non vale per i lupi.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W14=I marinai di Gilneas sono dei veri lupi di mare... Ahahah!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected00=I forti sopravvivono!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected01=Ti meriti il mio favore.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive00=Gilneas prevarrà.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive01=Sono sopravvissuto a molto peggio.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive02=Non deluderò la mia gente un'altra volta!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec00=Naturalmente.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec01=Una scelta apprezzabile.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec02=La maledizione si rafforza...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec03=La sicurezza è l'arma dei re.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Oh, sei tu. Spiacevole.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Salute, amico! Scendiamo in campo e facciamoci onore.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Sonya00=Io li congelo, tu li abbatti. Ti suona bene?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_SonyaDK00=Sonya, che ti è successo? Quella è una spada runica?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=È da molto che non combattiamo insieme, Thrall.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Lord Uther... Mi dispiace tanto per Arthas, se solo avessi potuto convincerlo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=La mia magia è al tuo servizio, maestà...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_Zagara00=Zagara... Che fortuna.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroQuestion_ZagaraCrypt00=La Madre delle Cripte è strisciata fuori dalla sua tana.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroRespond00=Qualcuno ha provato a farli ragionare? Dicevo per dire.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroRespond01=Perché credi che sia qui?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroRespond02=Se posso essere d'aiuto...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Alexstrasza00=Ti aiuterò come posso, Regina dei Draghi.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Anduin00=Anduin, sei cambiato così tanto... Che cosa è successo?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Non è saggio fare arrabbiare una maga.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Non rivolgermi la parola. Avrai anche l'aspetto di Arthas, ma non sei affatto come lui.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Beh, se lo dici tu...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=A qualcuno farebbe comodo una mentina...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=Non sono sicura di aver capito...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Hai finito?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=Questa sì che è una buona idea!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Non ci sono dubbi.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Kael00=Kael, ti prego. Sai che non accadrà mai.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=<chuckle> Tutto sommato, è carino.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Non ho tempo per starti a sentire...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Vieni, la battaglia ci attende!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Sonya00=Quanta gentilezza, hai per caso frequentato Uther?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_SonyaDK00=No, Sonya... Arthas pagherà per questo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=È bello stare dalla stessa parte, per una volta.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=Non sai quanto ci sono mancati i tuoi consigli, Uther.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Ah, questo è il re che ricordavo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/IntroResponse_ZagaraCrypt00=Non usare quel tono con me, insetto!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill00=Con me non si scherza.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill01=Per il Kirin Tor!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill02=Questo dovrebbe farci guadagnare tempo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill03=Stattene un po' al fresco.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Kill04=Mi sono stancata di te.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillArthas00=Per la Luce... riposa in pace, Arthas.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillDemon00=Non tolleriamo quelli della tua razza, demone.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillDreadJaina00=Non vorrei mai diventare come te!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillGarrosh00=Non meriti la mia misericordia, Garrosh!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillHorde00=Se solo fossimo riusciti a mettere da parte le nostre differenze.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillJaina00=Non ho mai particolarmente sofferto il freddo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillKael00=Così impari a stare al tuo posto.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillMuradin00=Un guerriero dovrebbe tenersi alla larga da una maga del gelo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillMurky00=Oh, mi sa che stavolta l'ho ucciso sul serio!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillOverwatch00=Questa tecnologia è già obsoleta.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillRagnaros00=Calma i bollenti spiriti, Signore del Fuoco.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Ho ancora qualche asso nella manica.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillThrall00=Peccato che tu non senta ragioni.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/KillUndead00=Tornatene nella tomba!

VoiceOver/JainaBase/LowMana_Evo00=Poco mana.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/No01=Cosa? Non è possibile.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/No02=Non posso farlo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Un nostro alleato ha bisogno d'aiuto!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Presto, ho bisogno d'aiuto!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Aiutatemi, se potete!

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Abbattete quella struttura.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=Eliminatelo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=Dobbiamo toglierlo di mezzo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Un attimo, il mio nemico è scomparso.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_EnemyMissing01=Il nemico è scomparso dalla mia vista.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_KillHero00=Concentratevi su questo eroe!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=Sto arrivando.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=Sarò lì in un attimo.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Va bene, è il momento di consegnarli.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Sarà meglio andare al punto di consegna.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed00=Qual è il piano?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed01=Shhh... sto cercando di pensare.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed02=Io volevo soltanto studiare... Certo, poi un demone gigante ha devastato casa mia... E così tanti saluti agli studi.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed03=Chissà se i miei incantesimi di teletrasporto funzionano qui. Dove l'avrò messo? Ah, eccolo qua! Azeroth metrion zinthos. Nah, c'è qualcosa che non va...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed04=Accidenti, qui le cose si fanno DAVVERO strane. Cioè, prima ho visto un nano che somigliava a un bignè!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed05=Ehhh, un capello bianco? Spero che non sia un brutto segno.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed06=Certo che fa piacere uscire di tanto in tanto. Mi sento come se fossi rimasta per anni rinchiusa in una torre.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed07=Chissà perché lo chiamano polimorfismo se trasforma qualunque nemico nella stessa cosa? Avrebbero dovuto chiamarlo "monomorfismo" o "incantesimo pecorizzatore".
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed08=Sono una maga coi fiocchi. Di neve, per l'esattezza.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed09=Ehi, sai come rompere il ghiaccio con una ragazza? <SFX: ice block magical sound> Faresti meglio a iniziare a pensarci.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed10=Salagadula, Magicabula, Bibidibobidibù, fa la magia tutto quel che vuoi tu, Bibidibobidibù.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed11=Vediamo di capirci... Questi incantesimi non sono uno scherzo. Gli scherzi sono quelli che si fanno durante la Veglia delle Ombre in cambio di dolciumi.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed12=Come sarebbe a dire? Io e Thrall? Ugh... Chi è che continua a mettere in giro queste voci indecenti? (pausa) E poi lo sanno tutti che preferisco il blu al verde.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed13=Senza dimenticare che i miei ultimi due spasimanti hanno cercato entrambi di conquistare il mondo. Già, dovrei dedicarmi solo allo studio...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed14=Orda e Alleanza possono coesistere, l'ho visto succedere. Un solo evento è stato capace di unirci.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed15=Non c'è futuro con Arthas. Che cosa potremmo fare insieme, io e lui? Aprire una gelateria a Nordania?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed16=Quando mio fratello Derek fu ucciso, mio padre giurò di annientare tutti gli orchi di Azeroth... Mi sono sempre chiesta come reagirei a una perdita simile. Prego di non doverlo scoprire mai.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed_Evo00=Quale è... piano?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed_Evo01=Cerco di pensare...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Resurrected00=Ti sono grata.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Resurrected01=Grazie di avermi riportata indietro!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd00=Servita fredda. Proprio come piace a me.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd01=La prossima volta magari sarai più ragionevole.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd02=Bene, storia chiusa.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart00=Oh, ora inizi a darmi sui nervi.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart01=La prossima volta toccherà a te.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart02=Odio ricorrere alla violenza. Ma per te farò un'eccezione.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive00=Ci vuole ben altro per togliermi di mezzo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive01=Sbrighiamoci, i nostri alleati hanno bisogno di noi.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive02=Va bene, riproviamo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Dance00=Serve solo un pizzico di magia.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Dance01=Oh, questo ballo mi piace molto di più.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Goodbye00=Che la Luce sia con te.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Goodbye01=Stammi bene.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Hello00=Salve.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Hello01=Ehilà.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Sorry00=Mi dispiace.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Sorry01=Chiedo scusa.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Thanks00=Grazie.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_WellPlayed00=Ottima mossa.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Bella giocata.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec00=Ho già in mente diversi modi di servirmene.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec01=Bella scelta.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec02=Questo ci farà molto comodo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec03=Mi piace l'idea.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed05=Gli occhiali? Sono solo lenti cosmetiche...
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed06=Era da un po' che non indossavo una tuta per ambienti ostili. Da quando ci sono tutte queste linee luminose?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed07=Valerian non mi è mai stato simpatico, ma devo ammettere che i suoi ragazzi hanno sviluppato dei giocattolini niente male. Ricordami di ringraziare quel Reigel alla prima occasione.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed08=Considerando quanto sono costate queste ali, avrebbero potuto fare uno sforzo in più e metterci anche un dispositivo occultante.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed14=IO SONO LO SCIAME! Volevo dire... Uh, scusa, è difficile abbandonare i pensieri collettivi di un'intera razza. EVOLVERSI! SOPRAVVIVERE! OK, ci vorrà un po' di tempo.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Resurrected00=Sono viva? Grazie davvero.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Resurrected01=Bene, sono tornata.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Revive00=OK, questo faceva molto male. Evitiamo che si ripeta.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_WaitLocked01=Non aspettavo altro...
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_WaitPurchased00=Queste tute per ambienti ostili non tengono molto caldo. <shiver>

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroAgree00=Concordo.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroAgree01=D'accordo.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroAgree02=Certamente.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroBoast00=Presto i miei nemici soffriranno come ho sofferto io.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroBoast01=Che il massacro abbia inizio.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion00=Siete pronti a far piovere morte sui nostri nemici?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion01=Confido che voi siate pronti.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Mi ricordi qualcuno. Ah, già... me.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Stavolta intendi combattere o ripetere ancora quella manfrina sull'essere imbattibile?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Crociata... Sembra che il fato abbia decretato la nostra alleanza.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Allora, come procede la tua alleanza con gli angeli?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Non ti bastavano gli Inferi, demone?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Quando tutto questo sarà finito, faremo i conti, demonio.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Monk00=Non dovresti essere già morto in una delle tue dissennate avventure?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Sei accusato di essere un traditore del Khanduras. Come ti dichiari?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Non temere. La mia esperienza sopperirà alla tua inettitudine.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=I tuoi servigi sono bene accolti.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_RainDeath00=<DO NOT RECORD. REUSES AN INTRO LINE>
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Hai qualcosa da dire, angelo?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroRespond00=Ma certo.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroRespond01=Il re di Khanduras è sempre pronto.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroRespond02=Sì... Che i nemici assaggino la nostra collera.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Ana00=Io risorgerò. E tu?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Io non sono un servo. Perlomeno ero davvero un re prima di cadere in preda alla follia.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Ancor più di te.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Io sono sempre dalla parte giusta. Se solo si potesse dire lo stesso dei miei "alleati"...
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Nemmeno io faccio i salti di gioia.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Perché devi tormentarmi anche qui? 
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Non c'è riposo per me, abominio. Ma la mia mente è libera.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Junkrat00=Cosa? Osi prenderti gioco di un re!?!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Monk00=Preferisco Re Nero. È molto più sinistro.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Cosa? Osi prenderti gioco di un re!?!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Non usare quel tono con me.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_No00=<Reuses No02>
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Assieme saremo inarrestabili.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Ah, allora sai chi sono, angelo. Eppure, non hai fatto nulla mentre Diablo distruggeva il mio regno.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill00=Tutti sono leali nella morte.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill01=Questa cospirazione sarà estirpata!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill02=Un traditore in meno!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill03=Nessuno piangerà la tua morte.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill04=Servi il tuo re...
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillArthas00=C'è posto per un solo re corrotto da queste parti.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillAzmodan00=Un Maligno Minore, di nome e di fatto.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillBarbarian00=Ora sei morta come il resto della tua gente, selvaggia.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillButcher00=Così impari a lordare di sangue le mura delle mie prigioni.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillCrusader00=Forse questo ti metterà a tacere una volta per tutte.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillDemonHunter00=Mi raccomando, salutami la tua sorellina
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillDiablo00=Giustizia per i miei figli! E per quella faccenda della pazzia...
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillMonk00=Mille e uno dei e nessuno di loro ti ha salvato.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Non sei all'altezza.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillTyrael00=La giustizia è una menzogna.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillUther00=Paladini... insopportabili.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillWitchDoctor00=Ora potrai visitare la Landa Informe di persona.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillWizard00=Non mi è mai piaciuta la tua spocchia.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowLifeHeal01=Pensavo che la fine fosse prossima.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowLifeHeal02=Mi hai riportato indietro dall'abisso.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowMana00=Sto esaurendo il mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowMana01=Non ho abbastanza mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowMana02=Mi serve più mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/No00=Non lo farò.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/No01=Impossibile.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/No02=No.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Un alleato ha bisogno d'aiuto.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Assistete il vostro re!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Prestatemi aiuto.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Attaccate il nucleo nemico!

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Difendete questo forte.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Dobbiamo difendere la torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_KillHero00=Eliminate quest'eroe!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed00=Come osi?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed01=Chi disturba il re di Khanduras?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed02=Sono già morto. Quindi, quando mi uccidono, cosa divento? Mortissimo? Stramorto? Vivo?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed03=Non è facile gestire una famiglia, un regno e l'anima del Primo Maligno.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed04=Quei pezzenti mi chiamavano folle... paranoico! È forse da paranoici pensare che tutti vogliano ucciderti? Lo è? LO È? Ah, sì? Beh, e invece quando lo fanno sul serio?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed05=Queste vecchie ossa temono una cosa sola: l'osteoporosi.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed06=Qualcun altro sente queste voci? Cosa? No... Sì! Sì, sì! Presto TUTTI lo faranno.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed07=Ehi! Tieni giù quelle manacce dal mio osso sacro!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed08=Sono il Re Scheletro, non il Re degli Scheletri. Una differenza sottile ma essenziale.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed09=Eroi? Intendi quei vagabondi che fanno irruzione in casa mia, rompono tutta la mia collezione di vasi, mi resuscitano solo per uccidermi e lasciano un mucchio di paccottiglia bianca sul pavimento? Certo, davvero molto eroico....
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed10=Lo senti anche tu? Mi sa che sta per piovere.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed11=L'Oscurità mi segue. Anche io la seguo, ma non è molto attiva sui social.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed12=Vorresti forse insinuare che non mi trovi simpatico? Forza, sputa l'osso!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed13=Allora, vediamo: il femore si collega all'anca. Le anche si collegano alle costole. Le costole si collegano alla clavicola... Forse non avrei dovuto smontare tutto senza le istruzioni.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed14=Bevete tanto latte. Fa bene alle ossa.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Resurrected00=Chi mi richiama fra i vivi?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Resurrected01=L'eterno riposo dovrà attendere.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive00=La tomba non può fermarmi!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive01=Il mio regno è eterno!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive02=Non si può uccidere ciò che non ha vita.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec00=Una scelta degna di un re.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec01=Come è mio diritto!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec02=Un re non merita nulla di meno.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec03=Scelta impeccabile.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec04=Una scelta avveduta.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Taunt00=Fuggi o muori.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Taunt01=Sottomettiti a me!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Taunt02=Porta qui la tua testa, così posso tagliarla.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/TeamKilled00=Dobbiamo radunarci per sottomettere i nemici!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_ExLocked00=Il Re Scheletro chiama il tuo nome.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Sto aspettando.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Gift00=Sarà meglio che si tratti di qualcuno degno di me.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Lockin00=Tutti soffriranno!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Purchase00=Una saggia decisione.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Trial00=Non te ne pentirai.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Trial01=Finalmente, l'occasione di ottenere la mia vendetta.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Non sottovalutare la mia furia.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Devo essere liberato da questo purgatorio.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Il nemico non indugia, e nemmeno noi dovremmo farlo.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Presto. Prima che ti faccia decapitare.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ultimate1Used00=Benvenuti nella vostra tomba!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ultimate1Used01=Non c'è scampo!

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Healed02=Bene. Rimani fedele al tuo signore.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree00=Confido che alle parole farai seguire i fatti...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree01=La tua collera sarà una potente alleata.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree02=Stavolta nessuno ci fermerà.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion01=Siete pronti?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Sento che ti affanni per controllare l'oscurità. Non ne sei degno.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Percepisco in te l'oscurità, demone. Meno che in altri, tuttavia abbastanza da servirmi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Interessante. Stai al fianco di un signore dell'oscurità, eppure non hai paura...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Hmm. Luce e oscurità si scontrano in te... Nessuna creatura può servire due padroni per sempre.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Un essere di pura oscurità. Servi l'Impero Eterno e potresti sopravvivere.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Il tuo potere servirà l'Impero Eterno, demone. Resisti e te lo strapperemo con la forza.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Monk00=Percepisco solo immobilità in te, umano. Com'è che non sei ancora morto?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Murky00=C'è molto odio in te. Unisciti a me e otterrai la vendetta che cerchi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Non darti pena. Ho già conquistato mondi da solo...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Credo che potresti essermi utile. Spero per il tuo bene di non sbagliarmi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Una creatura della luce... L'Impero Eterno ha già affrontato esseri come te. Erano squisiti.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond00=Trovo insopportabile la tua mancanza di fede.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond01=La domanda è, tu lo sei?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond02=Bada agli affari tuoi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Ana00=Mi sei utile, perciò tralascerò questa insolenza, per ora.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Ah, un re che s'illude di comandare i morti... Avrei parecchio da obiettare a riguardo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Lo scoprirai presto.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Questo è un nome che non sentivo da tanto tempo... Pronuncialo ancora e te ne pentirai.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Se sei ancora in vita lo devi a me. Non farmi pentire della mia generosità.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Demon00=Mi sei utile, perciò tralascerò questa insolenza, per ora.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Il tuo tono mi ricorda quello di molti che ora non esistono più. Ti suggerisco di ripensarci.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Monk00=Non sono chi credi che io sia, umano. Considerati fortunato a non conoscermi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Murky00=Se è quello che vuoi, non ostacolerò la tua collera.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Negative00=Basta.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Positive00=Bando alle ciance... C'è molto da fare.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Sì, creatura della luce... cedi alla paura, così che l'oscurità possa consumarti.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill00=Fin troppo facile.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill01=Ti manca la convinzione.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill02=L'Impero non sopporta i traditori.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill03=Un'esibizione insignificante.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill04=E anche questa è fatta.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillArthas00=La morte ti circonda, ma non sei il suo padrone.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillAzmodan00=Perché ti ribelli, demone? I nostri desideri coincidono.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillBarbarian00=Mai pensato di indossare un'armatura?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillButcher00=Quanta rabbia... Quanto odio. Mi sarai utile, bestia.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillCrusader00=Tendi a risultare un po' logorroica, crociata.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDemonHunter00=Ti affidi all'oscurità, ma non è stata essa a originarti.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDiablo00=All'Impero Eterno farebbe comodo il tuo potere, Diablo. Unisciti a me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillMonk00=Prega tutti gli dei che vuoi. Non possono salvarti da me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillSpreeEnd00=Persino le tue imprese impallidiscono di fronte a me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillTyrael00=Curioso. Un angelo? O soltanto una creatura della luce che finge di esserlo?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillUther00=Tutti coloro che servono la luce verranno estinti.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWitchDoctor00=Giochi con poteri che vanno oltre la tua comprensione.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWizard00=Tu... non sei lei... ma la tua morte mi soddisfa ugualmente.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal00=Ben fatto. La mia forza ritorna.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal01=Ah, la mia morte è stata rinviata.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal02=Stavolta ci sono andato un po' troppo vicino.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana00=Ho poco mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana01=No, mi manca il mana per farlo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana02=Ho bisogno di mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No00=Ciò è impossibile.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No01=Non costringermi a ucciderti.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No02=Mai.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistHero00=Un nostro alleato sta cedendo! 
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe00=Con me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe01=A me, presto!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackCastle00=Il nucleo. Eliminatelo!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackMerc00="Convincete" quei mercenari a unirsi a noi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Distruggete le loro fortificazioni.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackTower00=Quella torre di guardia ci sarebbe assai utile.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Non fate cadere questo forte.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendTower00=Difendete questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_KillHero00=Mostrate a quest'eroe il potere dell'oscurità.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed00=Che cosa c'è?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed01=Stai mettendo alla prova la mia pazienza. Non ti conviene.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed02=L'Impero Eterno ha consumato innumerevoli mondi. Il loro potere è vincolato a me tramite l'oscurità.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed03=Sotto il mio vigile sguardo, abbiamo schiacciato tutti i nemici tranne uno. Perché queste Principesse Celesti sono così resistenti? ...E non è la forza dell'amore. Piantala con queste idiozie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed04=Sono un Signore Spaziale, non farmi spazientire.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed05=Allora, abbiamo un accordo. No, aspetta, lo cambio! Ah, molto meglio. Hmm, questa parte si potrebbe cambiare ancora... Sì, SÌ! Questo accordo sta continuamente migliorando.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed06=Mai sottovalutare il potere dell'oscurità. Dico sul serio. L'oscurità dà fuori di matto se ti azzardi a farlo. Lascia dei post-it... dappertutto.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed07=Semmai dovessi creare una superarma straordinariamente grande non lesinare sul controllo qualità. La più piccola disattenzione spesso conduce al disastro.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed08=Ci sono sempre due signori spaziali. Un maestro e un apprendista. I nostri incontri sono solitari... e a senso unico.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed09=Sì, il potere dell'oscurità ha l'aspetto di una sorta di ologramma rosso. E allora?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed10=<angry exertion> Questo visore continua ad appannarsi. <SFX: Squeegee sounds> Ah, molto meglio.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed11=Alcuni dicono che il nome dell'Impero Eterno è presuntuoso. Cioè, alcuni "dicevano" che è presuntuoso. È importante usare il passato quando si parla dei defunti.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed12=No, queste lucine non hanno uno scopo preciso. Ma se hai un corpo robotico, tanto vale ostentarlo, ti pare?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed13=Non esiste saga spaziale senza un cattivo che si rispetti.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed14=Non hai idea della quantità di batterie che consumo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed15=Nessuno accenna mai al fatto che lo spazio è estremamente noioso. È enorme, per lo più vuoto, e i pochi luoghi popolati sono pieni di rompipalle.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected00=Servizio senza fine. Eterna fedeltà.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected01=Ben fatto, fedele dell'Impero.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive00=E così il cerchio si chiude.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive01=Sono eterno, come il nostro impero.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive02=Ah... Che l'inquisizione continui.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive03=Pensavate di esservi liberati di me?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive04=Io non muoio. Né vivo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec00=L'oscurità si fa più forte.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec01=I nemici conosceranno la vera sofferenza.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec02=Hmm. Appropriato.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec03=Non deludi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec04=Bene, qualcosa di utile.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt00=Sei insignificante.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt01=Vieni incontro al tuo destino.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt02=Mi occuperò di te personalmente.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/TeamKilled00=Nooooo!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExLocked00=Spero tu abbia un buon motivo per importunarmi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah, una presenza familiare...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Gift00=Come desideri.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Lockin00=Questa galassia soffrirà.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Purchase00=Gloria all'Impero Eterno.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial00=Ah, un nuovo mondo da soggiogare.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial01=Vuoi una dimostrazione di potenza? Sarò lieto di dartela.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked00=Unisciti a me, e questa galassia cadrà ai nostri piedi.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked01=La mia pazienza non è infinita.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased00=Sappi che quando sarai stanco di aspettare, rimarrò imperturbabile.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased01=Quante stelle... Prima o poi saranno tutte mie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used00=Nessuno sfugge al proprio destino.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used01=Ah, adesso non avete scampo.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used02=Benvenuti all'arena del destino.

VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_AttackMerc00=Andiamo a prendere un campo di mercenari!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Bene, chi ci sta a prendere un forte?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_AttackTower00=Dovremmo conquistare questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Sarà meglio difendere questo forte.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_DefendTower00=Va bene, non possiamo perdere questa torre di guardia!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_KillHero00=Sapete, qualcuno deve fermare quest'eroe.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed00=Ehilà!

VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/KillRaynor00=Esco vittorioso.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/KillSpreeEnd00=Servizio terminato!
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/KillTassadar00=Quella forma di vita mi somigliava molto.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/KillZeratul00=Hmm. Familiare, e tuttavia...

VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed03=Scopo primario: eliminare il pericolo Kaiju. Scopo secondario: apparire fichissimo.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed04=Il mio capo progettista era appassionato di un antico gioco chiamato StarCraft. Pare che fosse piuttosto bello.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed05=La libertà è un diritto per tutti gli esseri senzienti. Tranne che per Diablo Kaiju. Lui merita di morire!
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed06=Spesso mi domando perché mi hanno dotato di un cabina di pilotaggio... Si aspettavano che mi portassi in giro un omino sulla schiena?
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed07=Continuano a chiedermi se le macchine sono davvero in grado di provare delle emozioni... ma il mio dubbio è: gli umani sono davvero in grado di eseguire dei calcoli?
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed08=A proposito... Devo ricordarmi di chiamare la mia scheda madre.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed09=Provengo da un pianeta in cui i mostri distruggono intere città, e gli unici in grado di difenderle sono dei giganteschi robot senzienti. È meno divertente di quel che sembra, credimi.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed10=Bah wip gra na wip ninni bang. È un... cosa? Come sarebbe che se l'è inventata Illidan questa battuta? L'elfo? Quello non conta! Sono io il robot!
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed11=Coraggio, Blizzard. Un Tassadar Mech trasformabile... So che potete farcela.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed12=Trasformarsi in un jet? Notevole. Trasformarsi in un cannone? Banale.

VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes06=Finché tutti saranno uniti.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes07=Intesi.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes08=Determinazione piano di volo.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Attack00=Forza, attaccate! Sfruttiamo l'opportunità!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Attack01=È la nostra occasione di attaccare!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Attack02=Avanti, li abbiamo messi alle corde!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Caution00=Attenti. Qualcosa non va.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_GoodJob00=Così si fa!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_GoodJob01=Ah, siamo una grande squadra.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_GoodJob02=Continua così!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Heal00=Vai a una fonte. I miei naniti non possono fare miracoli.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Heal01=Va' a una fonte curativa. Ordine del dottore.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Retreat00=Devo ritirarmi. Torno presto.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Retreat01=Sono messa male... Mi ritiro un attimo.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Uhoh00=No no no!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Uhoh01=Alleato a terra!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Uhoh02=Non mollare. Resta con me!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack00=Trattamento aggressivo, eh?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack01=Mettiamoci al lavoro.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack02=Be' questo farà PARECCHIO male.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack03=È il momento di operare.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack04=Meglio avvertire il traumatologico.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack05=Sterilizziamo!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack06=Ci penso io!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Celebrate00=Bel lavoro, avanti così!

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Healed01=Grazie. È una fortuna averti vicino.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Healed02=Mi piace lavorare con altri professionisti.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroAgree00=Ah, l'hai detto.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroAgree01=Io vi copro le spalle.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroAgree02=Siamo sulla stessa barca, OK?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroBoast00=Ricordate: quando collaboriamo siamo inarrestabili.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroBoast01=Hmm. Quelli non hanno la minima speranza.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion00=Pronti al combattimento, soldati?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion01=Spero che siate pronti. I nemici lo saranno.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=La Regina delle Lame.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Un attimo, dai dati risulta che sei un maschio. Ma com'è che deponi le uova?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Fantastico, mi tocca lavorare con te, eh?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Sembri un tipo a posto. Vinciamo questa battaglia insieme!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Protoss00=Protoss... che bellezza.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Raynor00=Comandante Raynor. Le copro le spalle.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_SgtHammer00=Ehi, io ti conosco... Alabama Kowalski, giusto?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Tychus00=Marine e Medico. Una combinazione classica.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Undead00=Non ho mai curato qualcuno già morto, ma... ci proverò.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Collaborare con gli zerg non mi va molto a genio.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroRespond00=Io vi manterrò in vita, su questo potete contarci.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroRespond01=Sono sul pezzo.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroRespond02=Puoi contare su di me.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Risparmiati i drammi per la fine della battaglia, soldato.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Certo, come no. Facciamo alla svelta.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Sì, OK. Come no.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=Ooh, brutta infiammazione. To', prendi due di queste e dacci un taglio.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Il mio campo è più mantenerla tutta d'un pezzo, la gente.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_MedicLove00=Tutti vogliono bene ai medici.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Uh, qualcuno parla sgombrese? O salmoniano?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Possiamo farcela!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Protoss00=Neanch'io faccio i salti di gioia, alieno.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Oh, stai ancora parlando? Che meraviglia.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Tychus00=Sarò la tua ombra. Vediamo d'andare.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Undead00=Curare uno zombi. Be', è il giorno più strano della mia vita.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=Spero solo che questo Raggio Curativo funzioni su... qualunque cosa tu sia.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Avremmo dovuto farti fuori finché ne avevamo l'occasione.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Kill00=Ora del decesso: immediata.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Kill01=Tracciato piatto.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Kill02=Prognosi del paziente: morte.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Kill03=Mi sa che non abbiamo abbastanza sacche da cadavere.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Kill04=Qualcuno avverta i parenti.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillKerrigan00=Be', questa è una cura per l'infestazione.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillMedic00=Prova a curare QUESTO!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillPandaren00=Non posso credere di aver appena ammazzato un panda.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillProtoss00=Gli unici alieni buoni sono quelli morti.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillRaynor00=È morto... Jim.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Bene, e un problema è risolto.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillTerran00=Hai scelto la parte sbagliata, amico.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillWeird00=Qualcuno ha capito che roba era quella?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillWeird01=Cavolo, questi eroi sono sempre più strani.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillWeird02=Non voglio neanche sapere cos'abbiamo appena ucciso. Proseguiamo.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillWitchDoctor00=Fatti una laurea in medicina, altro che vudù.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillZerg00=Che schifo. Ho brandelli di zerg sugli stivali!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Laugh00=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Laugh01=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Laugh02=<laugh after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Laugh03=<laugh after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowLifeHeal00=Grazie, mi hai rimesso in piedi.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowLifeHeal01=Questo è quello che ha prescritto il dottore.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowLifeHeal02=Fiuu, me l'ero vista brutta. Bel lavoro.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowMana00=Sto finendo il mana.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowMana01=Le riserve di Mana scarseggiano.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowMana02=Ho bisogno di più mana.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/MatchEnd00=<Reuses a previous line of dialog. Do not record.>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/MatchEnd01=<Reuses a previous line of dialog. Do not record.>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/MatchEnd02=<Reuses a previous line of dialog. Do not record.>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/No00=Negativo.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/No01=Sappiamo entrambi che non è possibile.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/No02=Mm. No.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Forza, aiutiamo il nostro alleato.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Non ce la faccio da sola!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Ehi, qui mi servono rinforzi.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Tutti sul nucleo!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Prendiamo un campo di mercenari.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Dovremmo puntare su questo forte.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Dovremmo prendere questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Sembra che il nostro forte sia nei guai.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Dovremmo difendere questa torre di guardia se non vogliamo perderla.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_KillHero00=Visto quell'eroe? Liberiamocene.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed00=Servono cure mediche?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed01=Fornire i dettagli dell'emergenza medica.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed02=Mi sono arruolata nel DTU perché volevo un universo più sicuro per la mia famiglia. Non avrei mai immaginato di finire quassù.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed03=Ogni volta che penso alla Terra, mi rendo conto di quanto mi manca... tutto. Perfino gli insetti. Erano molto più piccoli dalle mie parti, sai?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed04=Oh no, questa storia delle toccatine... Inventati qualcosa... Insomma, sono un dottore, mica un'attrice!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed05=Se me lo chiedono, rispondo sempre che curare è facile. È esattamente come uccidere, ma alla rovescia.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed06=Tutti vogliono sempre far fuori il medico per primo. Ecco perché ho questo enorme scudo rigenerante.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed07=Scusa, ma sparare a un medico non è un crimine di guerra? La convenzione di Ginevra non vale nel Nexus?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed08=Dopo che hai somministrato neurostimolanti a un'Unica Mente appena nata tutto il resto è una passeggiata di salute... credimi.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed09=Alla millesima volta che ti senti chiamare "infermiera" cominci a contemplare l'idea della vivisezione dei pazienti.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed10=Personalmente odio gli aghi. Però, ficcare aghi addosso a qualcun altro è... be', puro e semplice divertimento.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed11=Ricorda sempre il codice di deontologia medica. Primo, mai far del male a qualcuno. Se non funziona, sparagli contro una granata.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed12=I Marine sono dei pettegoli. Fanno girare un sacco di voci, tipo che usiamo le graffettatrici per chiudere le ferite. Idioti... Io uso una SPARACHIODI. Le graffette costano un occhio.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed13=Devo dire che mi piace la nuova dotazione... Un attimo, niente mirino laser? Il lanciagranate è carino, ma mi divertiva tanto accecare la gente.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed14=Oh, c'è un foglietto. Questo Raggio Curativo non è stato valutato dal ministero della sanità. Non utilizzare macchinari pesanti o creature mitiche dopo il trattamento.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed15=Gli effetti collaterali possono includere nausea, sfasamento dimensionale, irritazione di stomaco e perdita di conoscenza. Consultare sempre un medico prima di usare il Raggio Curativo.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed16=Hmm... Sarà meglio che continui a usare quest'affare solo sugli altri.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Resurrected00=Whoa. Per un attimo ho visto la luce.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Resurrected01=Grazie. Non so cos'avrei fatto senza di te.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive00=Polso regolare. Segnali vitali stabili.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive01=Ecco il dottore.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive02=Va bene, torniamo in campo.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec00=Potenziamento completato.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec01=Ah, nuovi strumenti! Era ora.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec02=Sì, credo che potrò farci qualcosa di buono.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec03=Approvata da un medico su uno.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec04=Oh, questa mi piace.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt00=Lo vedi questo? Perché lo sto facendo più forte che posso.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt01=Sperate di aver qualche possibilità contro di noi? Ah.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt02=Tesoro, mi sono ripulita i guanti da soldati migliori di te.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/TeamKilled00=Rimettiamoci in sesto e torniamo a fare il nostro dovere.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_ExLocked00=Fornire i dettagli dell'emergenza medica.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_ExPurchased00=È sempre un piacere vederla, comandante.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Gift00=Dovunque ci sia bisogno di me.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Lockin00=Andiamo a salvare qualche vita.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Purchase00=Andiamo a salvare qualche vita.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Trial00=Un giro di prova, huh? Facile.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Trial01=Pronta per la diagnostica.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Vox_Spun00=<Do not record. Reuses Gethit sounds>

VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Sono pronta a dare una mano, comandante.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Possiamo andare quando vuole.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ugh, questo scudo è pesante. Possiamo darci una mossa?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ogni minuto muoiono oltre mille persone. Forse non dovremmo perdere tutto questo tempo.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used00=Nano-stim somministrato.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used01=Questo dovrebbe aiutare.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used02=Ecco fatto, soldato.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used03=Somministro stim.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used04=Stim attivato.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used00=Salite a bordo o restate indietro!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used01=Trasporto pronto. Chi viene?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used02=La Navetta medica sta atterrando. Tutti a bordo!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used03=L'ambulanza dei cieli è qui. Salite.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used_Friendly00=Salite a bordo o restate indietro!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used_Friendly01=Trasporto pronto. Chi viene?

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed03=Medita sulle tue azioni. Quindi, potrai agire saggiamente... almeno spero.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed04=Ho viaggiato per molte lande e incontrato molte persone. Trovare in esse la saggezza è come cercare un ago in un pagliaio.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed05=Ho viaggiato con un onesto guerriero che credeva solo alle  bugie, con una divinità che non credeva in se stessa e con un vecchio saggio che diceva solo sciocchezze.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed06=Sono venuto alla luce sotto il segno di Ytar, dio del sole. Ne porto il vessillo, e ne seguo la guida.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed07=Sono grato di non essere nato sotto il segno di un dio minore. Ci sono dei della pigrizia e della sciattezza, e sono in molti a servirli... forse anche troppi.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed08=Li ho i capelli, se proprio vuoi saperlo. È che li tengo rasati come segno di devozione.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed09=Ho spezzato tavole di legno a mani nude e digiunato per giorni di fila. Il dolore peggiore rimane quello di questo tatuaggio in faccia. 
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed10=Il mio cuore è vigile. Il mio spirito è puro. I miei mantra sono... incessanti.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed11=Quando usi la tecnica del Palmo Esplosivo ricorda sempre una cosa... Il palmo non deve esplodere davvero.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed12=Svuota la tua mente. Sii senza forma. Senza confini, come il fuoco. Se metti del fuoco in una tazza, brucerà la tazza, il tavolo e anche la casa. Sii il fuoco, amico. Non la tazza.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed13=Vedo che servi Sovyat, il dio del fastidio. Dev'essere molto orgoglioso di te.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed14=Devi sconfiggere Shenlong per avere una possibilità. Ed è morto da millenni. Buona fortuna.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed15=A Ivgorod ci sono molti patroni delle arti... marziali.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected00=La tua opera è degna degli dei.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected01=La nostra opera non è ancora compiuta.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive00=Gli dei desiderano che continui!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive01=La mia ora non è ancora giunta.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec01=Il mio cammino è chiaro.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec02=Gli dei mi favoriscono.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec03=Ytar mi ha elevato a nuove vette.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec04=La mia mente è più forte.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt00=Questa vita ti ha stancato?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt01=Affrontami e cadrai.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt02=La tua debolezza disgusta gli dei.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/TeamKilled00=È solo una prova. La supereremo.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExLocked00=Sono il pugno degli dei.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Manterrò l'equilibrio.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Gift00=Vedo che la mia presenza è richiesta altrove.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Lockin00=Ytar, guida il mio cammino.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Purchase00=Gli dei ti hanno conferito saggezza.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial00=Una prova? Eccellente.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial01=Ah, lascia che ti mostri qualche tecnica.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Coloro che nulla fanno, nulla diventano.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Il tempo è in costante movimento. Dovrei esserlo anch'io.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Non c'è trionfo senza rischio.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Gli dei non ricompensano chi non agisce.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used00=Gli dei colpiscono attraverso me!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used01=Assapora l'ira di Ytar!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate2Used00=Mille e una benedizioni.

VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed00=Sì?
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed01=Bah, che hai in mente?
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed02=Cosa ne pensi dei nuovi martelli? Secondo me sono... devastanti.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed03=Sono stato io a chiedere l'installazione di questa barba meccanica, ma non riesco proprio a ricordarmi a che cosa servisse.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed04=Posso offrirti una pinta... di olio? Ah, bello denso come piace a me.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed05=Volevano installare un razzo nell'impugnatura del martello. Gli ho detto: "Siete pazzi!" Solo un gigante potrebbe impugnare un'arma simile! Sparare dei missili è molto meglio che rimanerci attaccato.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed06=Non sono sicuro del significato della parola "cocci". Ma di sicuro me ne lascio molti alle spalle.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed07=Per l'ennesima volta, non sono questo "Rory Swann", smettila di chiederlo. È mio cugino!
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed08=Ehi, non mi sto "facendo un goccio", sto "facendo rifornimento". Aah, rifornito e pronto ad andare!
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed09=Una volta un tizio mi ha detto che questi razzi servivano a compensare la bassa statura. Non rimane molto di lui.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed10=Ah, certo i propulsori sono un'ottima aggiunta a questa tuta! Finalmente riesco a vedere il palco ai concerti!
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed11=Ah, ora mi ricordo a cosa serviva quella barba meccanica! Frigorifero incorporato!
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed12=Nell'ultima missione, ci hanno spedito su una nana rossa. Era una mia vecchia fiamma. Poverina, non usava mai la crema solare.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed13=Che ne dici di un po' di musica? Sono sempre in vena di un po' di metallo pesante.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Pissed14=Un ibrido tra una pistola e una spada? Mi prendi in giro? È ridicolo! Ora scusa, devo ricaricare il mio martello lanciagranate.
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Resurrected00=Tu sì che sai come farmi riprendere!
VoiceOver/MuradinMarauder/Resurrected01=...e si torna in gioco!

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion01=Hmm... sicuri di essere pronti?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Un macellaio. Sono contento che tu sia dalla mia parte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Finalmente, qualcuno di Sanctuarium. Forse mi sai dire perché questo tomo del portale cittadino non funziona.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Ah, le nuove generazioni. Pensi di poter stare al passo con un vecchio?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Quando questo scontro sarà concluso, il nostro avrà inizio, demone.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Riesci a mettere da parte i nostri dissapori per questa battaglia, Diablo?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Dismissive00=Ah, sei tu... In effetti stava andando troppo bene...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Dryad00=Un'aura di magia naturale ti circonda... Interessante.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=<Do not record. Reuses introboast.>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=E tu da quale angolo degli Inferi spunti?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Prova a non morire là fuori. Odio l'idea di dover evocare uno scheletro dal tuo cadavere.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Bene. Un potente alleato.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Arcangelo Tyrael, mi allieta vedere che ti batti ancora per l'equilibrio.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Wizard00=Attenta, maga... Alcuni tuoi simili hanno turbato l'equilibrio.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond00=Affronto la morte come una vecchia amica.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond01=Mai dubitare della mia abilità.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond02=Sì. Lo sono.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Ti prendi gioco di un sacerdote di Rathma a tuo rischio e pericolo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Ah, sì... questo spiega la tua presenza. Molto bene.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Affascinante.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Il tempo conta poco davanti all'eternità della morte...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Hmm... Nefilim... Dunque, le leggende sono vere. La faccenda si fa interessante.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Non mi sono mai unito ai demoni, e non ho intenzione di iniziare ora.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Lo so... Purtroppo non puoi. O ti sei dimenticato dell'ultima volta?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Risparmia il tuo veleno per qualcuno a cui importa.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=Andiamo... La morte è sempre stata qui.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Ah... davvero maturo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Quel suono mi fa venire i brividi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Qui conteranno solo le azioni, non le parole.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Vieni, sosterremo l'equilibrio assieme.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Tyrael... sono felice che tu sia sopravvissuto alla distruzione della Pietra del Mondo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Wizard00=Conosci il mio apprendista? Che strano.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill00=Solo un altro cadavere.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill01=Incontra la tua morte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill02=Mai mettere in dubbio le mie abilità.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill03=Ci vuole ben altro per fermarmi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill04=Sono al servizio dell'equilibrio.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill05=Ah! Il tuo orecchio è mio...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillArthas00=Solo un ragazzino, travestito da dio della morte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillAzmodan00=Hmph. Duriel era più forte... e stiamo parlando di una larva gigante.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillD3Hero00=E non sono nemmeno un nefilim.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDeath00=Ora c'è un "Signore della Morte" in meno nel Nexus.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDemon00=L'equilibrio sarà mantenuto, demone.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDiablo00=Diablo, ti ho superato!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillLeoric00=Non so che farmene di un non morto che non mi obbedisce.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillMephisto00=Buon viaggio, Mefisto. Salutami l'abisso.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Il potere della morte è nelle mie mani.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillTyrael00=Le mie scuse, angelo. Ma chi turba l'equilibrio deve pagare.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillUndead00=Che spreco di carne non morta.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillWitchDoctor00=I morti devono essere al nostro servizio, sciamano. Non il contrario.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillZeratul00=Avevi ragione... Le falci sono davvero belle.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ah, molto meglio di quelle disgustose pozioni.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal01=La gelida stretta della morte si scioglie.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ben fatto... Davvero ben fatto.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana00=Ho bisogno di... mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana01=Non ho abbastanza mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana02=Vorrei avere una pozione del mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No00=Eh eh eh. No.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No01=Non posso.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No02=Impossibile.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No03=Perché dovrei?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Il nostro alleato è in pericolo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Mi serve aiuto!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Datemi aiuto!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Distruggiamo il loro nucleo!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Conquistate questo campo di mercenari.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Abbattete questo forte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Hmm... questa torre di guardia potrebbe tornarci utile.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Difendete il forte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Non lasciate che prendano questa torre di guardia!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_KillHero00=La morte reclama questo nemico.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed00=Che cosa c'è?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed01=Devi proprio disturbarmi?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed02=Mmm? Oh, sì. La falce è una novità anche per me, ma devo ammettere che inizia a piacermi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed03=Ci sono solo due cose alle quali non si può sfuggire: la morte e... hmm. Mi sono dimenticato che cos'era la seconda. Oh, be', ripetiamo la morte, giusto per essere sicuri.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed04=Fidatevi, la morte vi fa belli.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed05=Noi sacerdoti di Rathma abbiamo ricevuto il compito di conservare l'equilibrio, ma a quanto pare non tutti capiscono di cosa si tratta.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed06=Pensate all'equilibrio come a una rete, una rete di salvataggio che impedisce ai vostri insignificanti corpi di essere consumati dall'oblio. Il mio compito è mantenere questa rete. Quindi... ringraziatemi!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed07=Il capo dei negromanti è chiamato Oratore della Morte. Prova a indovinare qual è il suo argomento preferito...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed08=Ai miei tempi nessuno ti credeva se affermavi l'esistenza dei Nefilim. Tuttavia, eccoli qui, e sono addirittura sei. Mi pare quasi eccessivo...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed09=Pensi che sia difficile? Forse non hai mai giocato in modalità Hardcore!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed10=Chi semina vento raccoglie tempesta, chi semina morte...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed11=Sì, sì, riporto in vita i morti. Il più delle volte non è un bello spettacolo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed12=Per l'ultima volta, un negromante non ha una "passione per i morti", quello è un necrof.. Ah, lasciamo perdere.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed13=Un giorno dovrò decidere che cosa fare con tutte queste orecchie. Forse una cintura o qualcosa del genere.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed14=Morti freschi, dici? Non male...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed15=Mantenere l'equilibrio è difficile. Ma se potenzi un angelo di qua e nerfi un demone di là è possibile farlo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected00=Torno... ma non come cadavere. Devo scoprire come si fa.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected01=Vera resurrezione? L'avrei detto impossibile.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive00=Allora è così che ci si sente da morti... Mi manca già.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive01=Il grande ciclo della vita ricomincia.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive02=Sembra che il mio compito non sia finito.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive03=Come? Non bisogna tornare al proprio cadavere? Oh, ottimo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec00=Interessante...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec01=Non vedo l'ora di provarlo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec02=Come deve essere.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec03=Sei sagace...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec04=Ah. Anch'io lo stavo tenendo d'occhio.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt00=Hai un appuntamento con la morte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt01=Fai bene ad avere paura di me, ma non ti servirà.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt02=Percepisco della... vita. Lascia che te ne liberi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/TeamKilled00=Non lasciare che la morte ti sconfigga. Usala per vendicarti.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExLocked00=La morte è al mio comando.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah... un volto familiare.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Gift00=Quanta generosità.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Lockin00=È il momento.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Purchase00=Torniamo all'azione.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial00=Mmm, roba seria.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial01=È il momento di allenarsi?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Vogliamo procedere?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Metti alla prova le mie abilità... non vedo l'ora di tornare a combattere.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Brrrr... Dovevo portarmi una camicia.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hmm. Battle.net è molto più lussuoso di come lo ricordavo.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used00=Nova velenosa!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used01=Corruzione fetida!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used02=Immondo fiato dei morti.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used03=Essenza venefica.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used00=Ecco il gelo della morte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used01=La stretta della morte si chiude su di voi.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used02=Levatevi al mio servizio!

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroRespond02=Le mie azioni parlano per me.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Silenzio, o ti do in pasto alla mia orsa!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Allearsi con i demoni... che strano mondo è questo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Chen00=Puoi dirlo forte, Chen. Vieni, andiamo a caccia ancora una volta.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_DemonHunter00=Finalmente, qualcun altro che ha esperienza di caccia.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=<Scoff> Certo, come no...
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Gazlowe00=Mi sono perso a Desolanda per qualche anno. A parte questo, non posso lamentarmi.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=Per l'Orda!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Hmm, pensiamo allo scontro che ci attende.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hmm, questo qui ha un'aria combattiva. Interessante.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Ecco perché preferisco la compagnia degli animali.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=Ah, tu... di nuovo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Solitamente preferisco gli animali, ma posso fare un'eccezione.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Samuro00=Anch'io sono felice di vederti, fratello.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Capoguerra... È un piacere tornare a combattere insieme.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Tired00=Ugh, questo mi sta stancando.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill00=Poteva finire in un solo modo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill01=Bello scontro.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill02=Ah! Dritto sul muso!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill03=I tuoi resti nutriranno le bestie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill04=Misha, non puoi mangiare tutte le schifezze che trovi in giro.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillButcher00=Più che un Macellaio, mi sembri un ammasso di carne trita.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillChen00=Bel tentativo, Chen. Ma non è bastato.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillChogall00=Sono i mollaccioni come te che infangano il nome degli ogre.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillDemonHunter00=Dovresti passare meno tempo a fare la preda, cacciatrice.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillHorde00=Ora riposa, eroe dell'Orda.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillJaina00=Hmph, e fanno due Marefiero di meno.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Facile.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillThrall00=Perdonami, Capoguerra.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh00=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh01=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh02=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh03=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh04=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Laugh05=<laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowLifeHeal00=C'è mancato poco. Grazie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowLifeHeal01=Mmm. Molte grazie.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowLifeHeal02=Molto meglio.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana00=Sto esaurendo il mana.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana01=Non ho mana.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana02=Non ho abbastanza mana.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel00=Misha, da me!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel01=Al piede, Misha!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel02=Vieni, Misha.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel03=Misha, vieni qui!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge00=Dagli addosso!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge01=Falli a pezzi, Misha!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge02=Carica!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge03=Vai, Misha!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel00=Misha, da me!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel01=Vieni, Misha.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel02=Misha, vieni qui.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel03=Al piede, Misha.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel04=Misha, qui.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel05=Qui, Misha.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel06=Misha, al mio fianco.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No00=Non sono in grado di farlo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No01=Tu chiedi l'impossibile.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No02=Non posso farlo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Un alleato ha bisogno di aiuto.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Mi serve aiuto.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Guerrieri, a me, presto.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Distruggiamogli il nucleo!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackMerc00="Reclutiamo" qualche mercenario.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Dovremmo attaccare questo forte.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Sarebbe meglio conquistare questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo, subito!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Dobbiamo difendere questo forte.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Difendete questa torre di guardia!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_KillHero00=Uccidete quest'eroe.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed00=Sono pronto a seguire la pista.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed01=La preda si avvicina.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed02=Gli animali sono l'unica famiglia che ho. A parte mio padre... Insomma, gli animali sono l'unica famiglia che ho.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed03=Alcuni pensano che cacciare con arco e frecce sia il massimo della difficoltà. Dovrebbero provare con un'ascia.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed04=Sono a caccia, e non ti mollo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed05=Giusto per essere chiari, tutto il bottino è mio. Mi serve per... ehm... segreto di cacciatore.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed06=Non tutti i Mok'nathal sono mezz'ogre. In realtà, io sono un quarto di ogre... al massimo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed07=Bene, siamo a cavallo. <nitrito> Non farmi saltare la mosca al naso... <ronzio> Hai proprio un cervello di gallina! <chiocciare di pollo> Asino. <raglio>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed08=I ragazzi di oggi... La maschera non è di pipistrello. È un lupo. Un lupo oscuro.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed09=Io? Perso? Per favore... Conosco Desolanda come le mie tas... E questo da dove spunta?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed10=Quando devo difendere la Roccaforte degli Spaccatuono dai cani dell'Alleanza, non posso combattere anche con la fame. Ecco perché inizio ogni giornata con una bella ciotola di frattaglie: la colazione dei campioni... dell'Orda.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed11=<SFX: Hearthstone Intro music plays> Hmm? Quello che faccio nel tempo libero sono fatti miei.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed12=<SFX: Unleash the Boars plays> Adoro questa parte. <SFX: Attack sounds start playing> <laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed13=A proposito, tutte le volte che un cacciatore ti ha battuto... ero io.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed14=<SFX: Hearthstone victory music plays.> Bene, la pausa è finita... Torniamo a questo Heroes of the Storm.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Resurrected00=Grazie, da qui me la cavo da solo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Resurrected01=Ottimo tempismo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive00=La mia forza si rinnova.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive01=Odo il richiamo della natura.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive02=Che la caccia abbia inizio!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec00=Andrà bene.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec01=Astuto.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec02=Una scelta avveduta.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec03=Molto bene.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec04=Lok'tar ogar!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt00=Ti darò la caccia!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt01=Dove speri di scappare senza che io ti trovi?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt02=Vieni qui, che ti tiro il collo!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/TeamKilled00=Non lasciatevi scoraggiare. È proprio quello che vogliono.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_ExLocked00=Forza e onore.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Thrall Hall!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Gift00=Mi sento a casa in qualunque posto.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Lockin00=Odo il richiamo della natura.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Purchase00=Vieni Misha, inizia la caccia.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Trial00=Una prova di forza? Capisco.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Trial01=Ti assicuro che supererò le tue aspettative.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_VOX_Spun00=<Dizzy sounds.>

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Vuoi unirti alla caccia?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Detesto attendere. Preferisco andare in giro.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Misha sta diventando impaziente. Non è saggio far aspettare un orso.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Non dovremmo prepararci alla battaglia?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ultimate1Used00=Misha, uccidi!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ultimate1Used01=Scatena la tua furia!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ultimate1Used02=È l'ora della pappa!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ultimate2Used00=A me!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ultimate2Used01=Huffer, trovali!

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Yes00=Agisco d'istinto.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Yes01=I nostri sentieri convergono.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Yes02=Seguo la pista.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Yes03=<sniffs the air> Di qua.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Yes04=Io vago da solo.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Yes05=Muoviamoci.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Yes06=La strada è lunga...
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Yes07=E sia.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Yes08=A caccia.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/AI_Attack00=Bisogna colpirli subito!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/AI_Attack01=Forza, travolgiamoli!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/AI_Attack02=Colpite quei pivelli più forte che potete!

VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Attack03=Ce li ho nel mirino.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Attack04=Musica per le mie orecchie.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Attack05=Sarà uno spasso.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Attack06=<laughter> Oh, sì!

VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Healed02=Grazie mille. Continua così!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroAgree00=Tu sì che parli la mia lingua.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroAgree01=Non occorre dirmelo due volte!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroAgree02=Polverizziamoli! E poi polverizziamoli di nuovo!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroBoast00=Facciamo saltare qualcosa!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroBoast01=Va bene, signorine! Continuate a sparare finché non resta più niente!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroQuestion00=Pronto a riscaldare l'ambiente?

VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroQuestion_Stitches00=Pensi di poter stare al mio passo, ragazzone?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroQuestion_Tychus00=Che arma grande che hai. Compensa qualcosa?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroRespond00=Pronti o no, ecco che arrivo!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroRespond01=No... Sono a bordo di un carro perché NON sono pronta... genio.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroRespond02=Oh, sì!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroResponse_Murky00=Scandisci! Non si capisce una parola!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroResponse_Negative00=Ehi, ho un'idea, perché non ti allontani di una trentina di metri e resti lì immobile...
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroResponse_Positive00=Non rovinare il momento. Il momento di distruggere cose, ovviamente.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroResponse_Stitches00=Ugh, devi proprio metterla in questi termini?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroResponse_Tychus00=E come potrebbero impedirmelo?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/IntroResponse_Yes00=<Reuses Respond02>

VoiceOver/SiegeTank/KillSpreeEnd00=Kablammo!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/KillWarfield00=Warfield, magnifico bastardo! Ho letto il tuo libro!

VoiceOver/SiegeTank/LowLifeHeal02=Oh bene, la lucina rossa ha smesso di lampeggiare. Grazie!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/LowMana00=Sto esaurendo il mana.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/LowMana01=Il mana è agli sgoccioli.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/LowMana02=Sono a secco di mana.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/No00=Ah ah. Escluso.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/No01=E come dovrei fare?

VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Ping_AssistHero00=Abbiamo un alleato nei guai!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Ping_AssistMe00=Mi servirebbero rinforzi.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Ping_AssistMe01=Sono nei guai!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Ping_AttackCastle00=Bombardiamogli il nucleo!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Ping_AttackMerc00=Dovremmo conquistare questo campo di mercenari.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Facciamo a pezzi questo forte!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Ping_AttackTower00=Prendiamo questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo, forza!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Difendiamo questo forte!

VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Ping_KillHero00=Vi spiace far fuori quest'infame?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed00=C'è da far saltare qualcosa?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed01=Dica!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed02=Cosa? Questa È la mia voce interiore!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed03=Non farmi girare i cingoli, socio.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed04=Mi piace l'odore del napalm... a qualsiasi ora.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed05=Il mio amato carro... Il mio carro amato... Il mio caro armato...
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed06=Inizi a starmi davvero sul carro.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed07=Se l'arma fa faville, il... carro fa scintille. Se l'arma fiammeggia, il... il carro festeggia... Ehi, pezzi di <beep>, quelle cose non le dico. Sono una signora, io.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed08=Sai, mi sono appena resa conto che non so neanche dov'è il portello di fuga su quest'affare... Perché c'è un portello di fuga, vero? Vero? Pronto?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed09=Tira più un carro d'assedio che uno di buoi.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed10=<alarm goes off> Giù dalle brande! Torniamo a dispensare un po' di giustizia indiscriminata!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed11=Vorrei lasciarti ma non ci riesco, carro d'assedio. <kiss noise>
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed12=Che cos'hai che non funziona? Piantala di cliccare!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed13=Ti credi tanto speciale, uh? Be', sappi che sei un fesso oltre che un cesso.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Pissed14=Fammi indovinare, pensavi che il sergente Hammer fosse un uomo, eh? T'ho fregato.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Resurrected00=Ho visto la luce per un secondo. L'ho mandata al diavolo!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Resurrected01=Una mano è sempre benvenuta.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Revive00=Rifornita e pronta ad andare!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Revive01=Andiamo... la battaglia aspetta!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Revive02=Pronti a muovere.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Spec00=Questa mi piacerà.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Spec01=Ah, ah, sì.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Spec02=Roger.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Spec03=Niente male, davvero niente male.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Spec04=Sembra divertente.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Taunt00=Qualcosa non va, bellezza?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Taunt01=Paura dell'ingegnosità terran?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/Taunt02=Continua a correre, che io continuo a sparare.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/TeamKilled00=Non mi lascerete mica da sola... vero?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/UI_ExLocked00=È una bellezza, vero?
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/UI_ExPurchased00=L'ho appena lavato.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/UI_Gift00=Oh, dev'essere proprio un carro amico...
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/UI_Lockin00=Pronti a muovere!
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/UI_Purchase00=Ha tutta la potenza di fuoco che puoi permetterti.
VoiceOver/SiegeTank/UI_Trial00=Oh, andrà ben oltre le tue aspettative. Fagli vedere i sorci verdi.

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_Retreat00=We must fall back.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_Retreat01=Retreat fools.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_Transport00=Move this thing.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_Transport01=Transport this now.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_TurnIn00=Turn these in.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_TurnIn01=We must turn these in.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed00=We are the Forsaken.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed01=My will is my own.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed02=Fast is fine, but accurate is final.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed03=You have no idea how tough it is to do this in heels.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed04=I have no time for games.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed05=Being undead isn’t all bad. You get to eat whatever or whoever you want and not gain a pound. Although keeping your jaw from falling off, does take some practice... And a little string.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed06=Night elf? I don't know what you're talking about.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed07=<Handheld Game Noises> Okay, maybe I've got SOME time for games.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed08=Time flies like an arrow. Flesh flies like carrion.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed09=<sings> Shoot that poison arrow through my heart...
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed10=What are we, if not slaves to this torment?
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed11=I'm no different from any other girl... I still dream of a Death Knight in shining armor who rides up on a Phantom steed and sweeps me off my feet with the blade of his evil sword! Turns me undead, and... Oh right... that's my nightmare.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed12=And let me tell you, torment is a very picky master. "Fold the towels like this, set the table like that..."
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed13=No I was never in Night Ranger... but I have an all-dead girl group called band-she.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed14=Just keep poking me and see what happens, savage.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed_Evo00=We are... Forsaken.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed_Evo01=My will... my own.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Resurrected00=My undeath continues.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Resurrected01=I've returned.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeEnd00=Hardly worth the effort.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeEnd01=Cur.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeEnd02=You underestimate me, cretin.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeStart00=I'll never stop hunting you.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeStart01=I have plans for you, dog!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeStart02=You dare attack the Banshee Queen?
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Revive00=What joy is there in this curse?
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Revive01=Death cannot hold me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Revive02=Undead. Again.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Dance00=I dance to express my frustration with your command decisions.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Dance01=I am not a pawn to dance for your amusement.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Goodbye00=I take my leave.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Goodbye01=Farewell.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Hello00=You address the Banshee Queen.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Hello01=Greetings.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Sorry00=My apologies.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Sorry01=So sorry.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Thanks00=Many thanks.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Thanks01=You have my thanks.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_WellPlayed00=Very clever of you.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_WellPlayed01=I couldn't have done it better.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec00=That will serve me well.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec01=Interesting.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec02=A wise selection.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec03=Good.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec04=Our victory is assured.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt03=Your presence offends me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt04=You will die first.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt05=I will spare no one.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt_Evo00=You... offend.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt_Evo01=You die.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt_Evo02=Sapre... no one.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/TeamKilled00=Do not fear, I have been through worse.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_ExLocked00=My only interest is vengeance.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_ExPurchased00=Our enemies will beg for death's release.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Gift00=How... noble.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Lockin00=Our foes may as well surrender now.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Purchase00=Your enemies are mine.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Trial00=A test then? So be it.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Trial01=You will not be disappointed.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitLocked00=Do it.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitLocked01=Unleash me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitPurchased00=I am not accustomed to waiting.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitPurchased01=Do not toy with me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate1Used00=Fly, banshee. Your queen commands you!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Fly... queen commands...
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate2Used00=Lights out!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate2Used01=Pay with your blood!

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/WorthIt01=Vengeance is all there is.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes00=Let's move out.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes01=We shall be victorious!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes02=I will do so.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes03=Spare no one.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes04=They won't know what hit them.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes05=Yes.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes06=It will be done.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes07=Slaughter them all.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes08=So be it.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo00=Move... out.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo01=We victorious.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo02=I do so.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo03=Slaughter all.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo04=So... it.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Attack00=È la nostra occasione. Intensificate l'attacco!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Attack01=Massacrateli dal primo all'ultimo!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Attack02=Dobbiamo colpire finché il nemico è debole!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Caution00=Attenzione.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_GoodJob00=Hai un discreto... talento.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_GoodJob01=Hai dato loro quel che meritavano.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_GoodJob02=Incantevole.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Heal00=Curati. Subito.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Heal01=Le ferite ti indeboliscono. Curati.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Retreat00=Devo ripiegare.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Retreat01=Indietro!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Uhoh00=La battaglia volge a nostro sfavore.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Uhoh01=Si stanno aprendo un varco!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Uhoh02=Nuove reclute per i Reietti...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack00=La vendetta è vicina...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack01=Non avrò alcuna pietà.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack02=Diamogli addosso!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack03=Continuo a combattere.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack04=Che nessuno sopravviva.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack05=A morte!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack06=Prega per la tua miserabile vita!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Celebrate00=Le loro difese crollano.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Celebrate01=Fuggono davanti a noi!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Comeback00=Hanno fatto tanta strada solo per morire ai nostri piedi.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Healed00=Niente male, guaritore.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Healed01=Ti sono grata... per ora.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Healed02=Mi sono ripresa.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroAgree00=Non mi aspetto niente di meno.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroAgree01=Certamente.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroAgree02=Scateniamo la nostra furia.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroBoast00=Trucideremo chiunque si opponga a noi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroBoast01=Pagheranno con il sangue.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion00=Pronto a veder cadere i nostri nemici?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion01=Sarà meglio che tu sia pronto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_BloodElf00=Sinu a'manore.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Forsaken00=La Dama Oscura ha bisogno di te.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Anche i più potenti possono cadere.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_GennGreymane00=A quanto pare la tua gente è rimasta senza una guida.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Kaelthas00=Ma guarda chi c'è, il nostro principino.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Cosa avete da guardare?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Saresti un magnifico mur'ghoul, non credi?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Speravo di non avere più a che fare con gli idioti.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Sembra che tutto sommato qui potresti tornarci utile.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroRespond00=Niente potrebbe fermarmi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroRespond01=Non sottovalutarmi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroRespond02=I nostri nemici soffriranno.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_BloodElf00=Mostra loro la forza di Quel'Thalas.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Forsaken00=Il tuo dovere è servire.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Mi piacerebbe ucciderti, ma preferisco umiliarti sul campo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_GennGreymane00=Morirai in agonia, proprio come tuo figlio.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Kaelthas00=Ah. Almeno io ho preso un trono!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=No! E dovreste evitare di bere prima di un combattimento.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Non dirai sul serio.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Frena la lingua o te la strappo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_No00=<DO NOT RECORD. REUSES NO SOUND>
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Questa sarà una... collaborazione conveniente.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Kill00=La punizione per il tradimento è la morte!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Kill01=Mi disgusti.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Kill02=Gloria ai Reietti!

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Kill04=Bash'a no falor talah!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillArthas00=Porgi i miei saluti all'oscurità eterna...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillBloodElf00=Shorel'aran, sindorei.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillGarrosh00=Stavolta i tuoi leccapiedi non ti salveranno, Garrosh.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillKaelthas00=Un debole, esattamente come tuo padre...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillKerrigan00=C'è una sola regina su questo campo di battaglia. Tu sei solo una pedina.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillSkeletonKing00=Comando io i Non Morti!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Non cesserò mai di combattere... Mai.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillStitches00=Nessun membro del Flagello sfugge alla mia ira!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillThrall00=Questo è per aver ceduto l'Orda a Garrosh!

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal00=Mi congratulo con te.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal01=Sono sopravvissuta!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ti riveli utile, guaritore.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana00=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana01=Ho bisogno di più mana.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana02=Non ho abbastanza mana per farlo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No00=Non credo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No01=<scoff> No.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No02=Mi rifiuto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Sarà meglio prestare soccorso al nostro alleato.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Mi serve aiuto!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistMe01=A me, subito!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Colpite dove fa più male... Il nucleo. 
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Dobbiamo "reclutare" quei mercenari.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Fate a pezzi questo forte!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Prendete questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Se il nucleo cade tutto è perduto. Difendetelo!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Difendete il forte con la vostra miserabile vita!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Obbedite al mio comando e proteggete questa torre.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_KillHero00=Uccidete quel sedicente eroe!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed00=Che cosa siamo se non schiavi di questo tormento?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed01=Noi siamo i Reietti.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed02=Prova a rifarlo e ti ritrovi con un moncherino.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed03=Il tempo vola come una freccia. La carne marcisce come feccia.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed04=La velocità va bene, ma è la precisione che conta.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed05=Non hai idea di quanto sia difficile farlo con i tacchi alti. Fortuna che ho tutte le terminazioni nervose putrefatte.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed06=Non ho tempo per giocare, ma compaio in un sacco di giochi... Hmm...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed07=Lo sanno tutti che a Sepulcra ci sono le migliori feste della Veglia delle Ombre.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed08=L'Ira del Re dei Lich non era niente. Aspetta di vedere quella della Regina Banshee.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed09=No, non canterò per te. Sono una spietata regina non morta, non un juke box.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed10=Mi credevo l'unica a essere stata uccisa da un uomo crudele, trasformata in un abominio potente ma orribile, a essermi autoproclamata regina e aver votato i miei sudditi a orchestrare la mia vendetta. Ma poi ho conosciuto Kerrigan!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed11=Senti, sono stata un'Alta Elfa, una Banshee e un'Alta Elfa Non Morta, ma mai un'Elfa della Notte. Io non "volto gabbana".
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed12=No, mai suonato in un complesso dark... ma ho un gruppo formato da ragazze morte stecchite che si chiama Band-She.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed13=Lo sentite anche voi questo ronzio? 
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed14=Bibidi, bobidi, bù, dentro la fossa ci finisci tu...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed15=Ugh! Cos'è questo tanfo? Sono sempre io?

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Response_CastingQ05=<whispered/ghostly>Talah!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Resurrected00=La tenebra non mi reclama... per ora.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Resurrected01=Era la mia Val'kyr quella?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Revive00=Che c'è di bello in questa maledizione?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Revive01=Per me non c'è più riposo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Revive02=Non ho tempo per giocare.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec00=Basterà.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec01=Interessante.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec02=Molto bene.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec03=Bene.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec04=La vittoria si avvicina.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt00=T'insegnerò il rispetto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt01=Chi mi insulta da vivo, mi servirà da morto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt02=Stavo giusto cercando un bersaglio... Ed eccoti qua.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/TeamKilled00=Non temete. Sono sopravvissuta a cose peggiori.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_ExLocked00=Con me o contro di me.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_ExPurchased00=La Dama Oscura veglia su di te.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Gift00=Un gesto... nobile
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Lockin00=Vittoria per i Reietti.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Purchase00=Oh, vedo che hai cervello.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Trial00=Non ne ho passate abbastanza?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Trial01=Ti trastulli con un potere che non puoi comprendere.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Datti da fare.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Scatenami.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Non sono abituata ad aspettare.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=La mia pazienza ha un limite.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate1Used00=Che la mia mira sia precisa.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate1Used01=È tempo di saldare i conti!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used00=Tu mi appartieni.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used01=Ascolta la Regina Banshee.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used02=Ascolta e obbedisci.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used03=Che mente debole.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used04=Vieni, seguace.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/VoiceLineThree00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/VoiceLineTwo00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/WorthIt00=Non affronterò la morte da sola!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/WorthIt01=La vendetta è il mio solo conforto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes00=Avanti!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes01=Sono qui.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes02=Ma certo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes03=Non mettere alla prova la mia pazienza.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes04=È il nostro momento!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes05=Fatto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes06=La mia volontà mi appartiene.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes07=Dai l'ordine.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes08=Ti ascolto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Attack00=È la nostra occasione. Intensificate l'attacco!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Attack01=Massacrateli dal primo all'ultimo!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Attack02=Dobbiamo colpire finché il nemico è debole!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Caution00=Attenzione.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_GoodJob00=Hai un discreto... talento.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_GoodJob01=Hai dato loro quel che meritavano.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_GoodJob02=Incantevole.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Heal00=Curati. Subito.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Heal01=Le ferite ti indeboliscono. Curati.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Retreat00=Devo ripiegare.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Retreat01=Indietro!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Uhoh00=La battaglia volge a nostro sfavore.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Uhoh01=Si stanno aprendo un varco!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Uhoh02=Nuove reclute per i Reietti...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack00=La vendetta è vicina...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack01=Non avrò alcuna pietà.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack02=Diamogli addosso!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack03=Continuo a combattere.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack04=Che nessuno sopravviva.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack05=A morte!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack06=Prega per la tua miserabile vita!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Celebrate00=Le loro difese crollano.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Celebrate01=Fuggono davanti a noi!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Comeback00=Hanno fatto tanta strada solo per morire ai nostri piedi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Death00=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Death01=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Death02=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Death03=<Death Exertion>

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Healed00=Niente male, guaritore.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Healed01=Ti sono grata... per ora.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Healed02=Mi sono ripresa.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroAgree00=Non mi aspetto niente di meno.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroAgree01=Certamente.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroAgree02=Scateniamo la nostra furia.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroBoast00=Trucideremo chiunque si opponga a noi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroBoast01=Pagheranno con il sangue.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion00=Pronto a veder cadere i nostri nemici?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion01=Sarà meglio che tu sia pronto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_BloodElf00=Sinu a'manore.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Forsaken00=La Dama Oscura ha bisogno di te.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Anche i più potenti possono cadere.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_GennGreymane00=A quanto pare la tua gente è rimasta senza una guida.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Kaelthas00=Ma guarda chi c'è, il nostro principino.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Cosa avete da guardare?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Saresti un magnifico mur'ghoul, non credi?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Speravo di non avere più a che fare con gli idioti.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Sembra che tutto sommato qui potresti tornarci utile.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroRespond00=Niente potrebbe fermarmi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroRespond01=Non sottovalutarmi.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroRespond02=I nostri nemici soffriranno.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_BloodElf00=Mostra loro la forza di Quel'Thalas.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Forsaken00=Il tuo dovere è servire.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Mi piacerebbe ucciderti, ma preferisco umiliarti sul campo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_GennGreymane00=Morirai in agonia, proprio come tuo figlio.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Kaelthas00=Ah. Almeno io ho preso un trono!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=No! E dovreste evitare di bere prima di un combattimento.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Murky00=Non dirai sul serio.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Negative00=Frena la lingua o te la strappo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_No00=Che cos'è che devo dire?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Positive00=Questa sarà una... collaborazione conveniente.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill00=La punizione per il tradimento è la morte!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill01=Mi disgusti.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill02=Gloria ai Reietti!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill03=Adesso basta con la tua insolenza!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill04=Bash'a no falor talah!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillArthas00=Porgi i miei saluti all'oscurità eterna...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillBloodElf00=Shorel'aran, sindorei.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillKaelthas00=Un debole, esattamente come tuo padre...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillKerrigan00=C'è una sola regina su questo campo di battaglia. Tu sei solo una pedina.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillSkeletonKing00=Comando io i Non Morti!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillSpreeEnd00=Non cesserò mai di combattere... Mai.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillStitches00=Nessun membro del Flagello sfugge alla mia ira!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillThrall00=Questo è per aver ceduto l'Orda a Garrosh!

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowLifeHeal00=Mi congratulo con te.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowLifeHeal01=Sono sopravvissuta!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowLifeHeal02=Ti riveli utile, guaritore.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowMana00=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowMana01=Ho bisogno di più mana.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowMana02=Non ho abbastanza mana per farlo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/No00=Non credo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/No01=<scoff> No.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/No02=Mi rifiuto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AssistHero00=Sarà meglio prestare soccorso al nostro alleato.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AssistMe00=Mi serve aiuto!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AssistMe01=A me, subito!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackCastle00=Colpite dove fa più male... Il nucleo. 
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackMerc00=Dobbiamo "reclutare" quei mercenari.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Fate a pezzi questo forte!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackTower00=Prendete questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendCastle00=Se il nucleo cade tutto è perduto. Difendetelo!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Difendete il forte con la vostra miserabile vita!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendTower00=Obbedite al mio comando e proteggete questa torre.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_KillHero00=Uccidete quel sedicente eroe!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed00=Che cosa siamo se non schiavi di questo tormento?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed01=Noi siamo i Reietti.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed02=Prova a rifarlo e ti ritrovi con un moncherino.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed03=Il tempo vola come una freccia. La carne marcisce come feccia.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed04=La velocità va bene, ma è la precisione che conta.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed05=Non hai idea di quanto sia difficile farlo con i tacchi alti. Fortuna che ho tutte le terminazioni nervose putrefatte.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed06=Non ho tempo per giocare, ma compaio in un sacco di giochi... Hmm...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed07=Lo sanno tutti che a Sepulcra ci sono le migliori feste della Veglia delle Ombre.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed08=L'Ira del Re dei Lich non era niente. Aspetta di vedere quella della Regina Banshee.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed09=No, non canterò per te. Sono una spietata regina non morta, non un juke box.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed10=Mi credevo l'unica a essere stata uccisa da un uomo crudele, trasformata in un abominio potente ma orribile, a essermi autoproclamata regina e aver votato i miei sudditi a orchestrare la mia vendetta. Ma poi ho conosciuto Kerrigan!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed11=Senti, sono stata un'Alta Elfa, una Banshee e un'Alta Elfa Non Morta, ma mai un'Elfa della Notte. Io non "volto gabbana".
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed12=No, mai suonato in un complesso dark... ma ho un gruppo formato da ragazze morte stecchite che si chiama Band-She.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed13=Lo sentite anche voi questo ronzio? 
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed14=Bibidi, bobidi, bù, dentro la fossa ci finisci tu...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed15=Ugh! Cos'è questo tanfo? Sono sempre io?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Response_CastingQ00=<Ghostly Whispers>

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Response_CastingQ05=<whispered/ghostly>Talah!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Resurrected00=La tenebra non mi reclama... per ora.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Resurrected01=Era la mia Val'kyr quella?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Revive00=Che c'è di bello in questa maledizione?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Revive01=Per me non c'è più riposo.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Revive02=Non ho tempo per giocare.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec00=Basterà.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec01=Interessante.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec02=Molto bene.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec03=Bene.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec04=La vittoria si avvicina.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt00=T'insegnerò il rispetto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt01=Chi mi insulta da vivo, mi servirà da morto.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt02=Stavo giusto cercando un bersaglio... Ed eccoti qua.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/TeamKilled00=Non temete. Sono sopravvissuta a cose peggiori.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_ExLocked00=Con me o contro di me.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_ExPurchased00=La Dama Oscura veglia su di te.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Gift00=Un gesto... nobile
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Lockin00=Vittoria per i Reietti.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Purchase00=Oh, vedo che hai cervello.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Trial00=Non ne ho passate abbastanza?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Trial01=Ti trastulli con un potere che non puoi comprendere.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitLocked00=Datti da fare.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitLocked01=Scatenami.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitPurchased00=Non sono abituata ad aspettare.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitPurchased01=La mia pazienza ha un limite.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate1Used00=Che la mia mira sia precisa.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate1Used01=È tempo di saldare i conti!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used00=Tu mi appartieni.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used01=Ascolta la Regina Banshee.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used02=Ascolta e obbedisci.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used03=Che mente debole.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used04=Vieni, seguace.

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroAgree00=Mostriamo loro la furia dell'Orda!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroAgree01=Che gli spiriti ci guidino.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroAgree02=Allora siamo d'accordo!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroBoast00=Lok'tar ogar! Vittoria o morte!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroBoast01=Nessuno si opporrà a noi!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion00=Sei pronto, guerriero?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion01=Lo scontro è imminente, spero che tu sia pronto...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Falstad00=Sei pronto ad ammirare Martelfato all'opera, nano?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Garrosh...

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=L'onore è mio. Lok'tar ogar, guerriero!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=È vero, Jaina.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hmm, chissà cosa vuol dire...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Presto parleranno le armi, così la pianterai di blaterare.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Combattiamo per la gloria dell'Orda.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Rehgar00=Le formalità non ti si addicono, Rehgar.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Rexxar00=Vieni, campione. Abbiamo una battaglia da affrontare.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Facile a dirsi, meno a provarsi.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill00=Il tuo fato termina qui!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill01=Cadi davanti all'Orda.

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillDeathwing00=La terra reclama la tua anima corrotta, Neltharion.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillDemon00=L'Orda non si inchina di fronte a nessun demone.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillETC00=Manda i miei omaggi alla Madre Terra.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillGarrosh00=Mi deludi per l'ennesima volta, Garrosh.

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ottimo tempismo, guaritore.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal02=Il mio spirito è rinfrancato.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana00=Sto esaurendo il mana.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana01=Ho bisogno di più mana.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana02=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No00=Impossibile.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No01=No, amico.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No02=Non farmi perdere tempo.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Un alleato ha bisogno di aiuto.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Datemi aiuto, presto!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Mi servono rinforzi!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Distruggiamo il loro nucleo! Lok'tar!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Dovremmo assicurarci i servigi di questi mercenari.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Guerrieri, attaccate il loro forte.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Impadroniamoci di questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Dobbiamo difendete il forte, immediatamente.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Guerrieri, difendete la torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_KillHero00=Abbattete quell'eroe, ora!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed00=Io sono il Capoguerra.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed01=Gli spiriti sono irrequieti.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed02=Hmm? Oh giusto... Ci sono le battute spiritose. Scusate, è passato un po' di tempo dall'ultima volta.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed03=<inhales> Ah, mi manca la strategia in tempo reale.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed04=La prospettiva isometrica, le grandi ed epiche battaglie...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed05=Tutte queste toccatine invece non mi mancavano...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed06=Non ci vuole un martello grande, ma un grande martello!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed07=Hai voluto il Capoguerra? Impara a guerreggiare.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed08=Mi stai facendo arrabbiare. Non ti piacerà vedermi arrabbiato.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed09=Dai retta al tuo Capoguerra... Non andare in giro a fare sciocchezze solo perché qualcuno urla: "Per l'Orda!"
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed10=Chi è arrivato prima? Martelfato o i Martelfato? Riflettici su.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed11=Ah, vediamo cosa mi hanno dato stavolta... Catena di Fulmini... sempre utile. Lupo Spirituale... Furia del Vento... Mi dispiace, Rehgar... sembra che le abilità migliori me le sia prese tutte io.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed12=Dopo un paio di espansioni di Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard mi sostituirà con Garrosh.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed13=Il colpo che uccise Orgrim intaccò per sempre il dorso di questa corazza. La porto per ricordare che il nemico può colpirti dove meno te l'aspetti.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed14=Come, come, come? Volete dirmi che questo gioco ha una trama? Avete davvero pagato qualcuno per inventarsi un modo in cui Raynor incontra Diablo? Ma allora a cosa serve la fan fiction? <Sigh> Giuro che non è stata un'idea mia.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Resurrected00=Grazie.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Resurrected01=Meno male che ci sei tu.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive00=L'Orda non morirà mai.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive01=Lok'tar ogar!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive02=Gli antenati mi benedicono.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec00=Hmmm. Ottima scelta.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec01=Hmm. Questa andrà benone.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec02=Il potere scorre in me.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec03=Gli spiriti sono benevoli.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec04=Sì, mi sento già più forte.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt00=Gli elementi ti distruggeranno.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt01=Io sono la furia dell'Orda!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt02=Affronta il figlio di Durotan!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/TeamKilled00=Il nostro spirito non si piega così facilmente.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_ExLocked00=Lok'tar.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Che cosa desideri, amico?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Gift00=Il tuo alleato è il mio.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Lockin00=Gloria all'Orda!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Purchase00=Per l'Orda!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Trial00=Bene, lascia che ti mostri come si fa.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Trial01=Fa' attenzione. Te lo spiego solo una volta.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Lascia che ti mostri il potere degli elementi.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Non attendiamo oltre. C'è una guerra da combattere.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Mi chiedo che cosa tu abbia di meglio da fare.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Lo sai che sono un CapoGUERRA, vero?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used00=Subisci la furia di Martelfato!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used01=Basta!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used02=Gli elementi ti sono ostili!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used03=Finisce ora!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used00=Terra, inghiotti i miei nemici!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used01=Tremate di paura!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used02=La terra stessa è la mia alleata!

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed02=Hmm? Oh giusto... Ci sono le battute spiritose. Scusate, è passato un po' di tempo dall'ultima volta.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed03=<inhales> Ah, mi manca la strategia in tempo reale.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed04=La prospettiva isometrica, le grandi ed epiche battaglie...
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed05=Tutte queste toccatine invece non mi mancavano...
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed06=Non ci vuole un martello grande, ma un grande martello!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed07=Hai voluto il Capoguerra? Impara a guerreggiare.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed08=Mi stai facendo arrabbiare. Non ti piacerà vedermi arrabbiato.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed09=Dai retta al tuo Capoguerra... Non andare in giro a fare sciocchezze solo perché qualcuno urla: "Per l'Orda!"
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed10=Chi è arrivato prima? Martelfato o i Martelfato? Riflettici su.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed11=Ah, vediamo cosa mi hanno dato stavolta... Catena di Fulmini... sempre utile. Lupo Spirituale... Furia del Vento... Mi dispiace, Rehgar... sembra che le abilità migliori me le sia prese tutte io.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed12=Dopo un paio di espansioni di Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard mi sostituirà con Garrosh.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed13=Il colpo che uccise Orgrim intaccò per sempre il dorso di questa corazza. La porto per ricordare che il nemico può colpirti dove meno te l'aspetti.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed14=Come, come, come? Volete dirmi che questo gioco ha una trama? Avete davvero pagato qualcuno per inventarsi un modo in cui Raynor incontra Diablo? Ma allora a cosa serve la fan fiction? <Sigh> Giuro che non è stata un'idea mia.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Resurrected00=Thank you.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Resurrected01=Meno male che ci sei tu.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeEnd00=Tutto qui?

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitLocked00=Lascia che ti mostri il potere degli elementi.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitLocked01=Non attendiamo oltre. C'è una guerra da combattere.

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitPurchased01=Lo sai che sono un CapoGUERRA, vero?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used00=Subisci la furia di Martelfato!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used01=Basta!

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate2Used00=Terra, inghiotti i miei nemici!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate2Used01=Tremate di paura!

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroQuestion_Falstad00=Sei pronto ad ammirare Martelfato all'opera, nano?

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Jaina, ne è passato di tempo...

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Felice di vederti, amico!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroQuestion_Rehgar00=Salve, fratello sciamano.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroRespond02=Ah ah, senz'altro.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroResponse_Falstad00=<sigh> Me l'avrai raccontato cento volte...
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Allora è un bene che io sia uno sciamano coi fiocchi.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroResponse_Horde00=L'onore è mio. Lok'tar ogar, guerriero!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroResponse_Jaina00=È vero, Jaina.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hmm, chissà cosa vuol dire...
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroResponse_Negative00=Presto parleranno le armi, così la pianterai di blaterare.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroResponse_Positive00=Combattiamo per la gloria dell'Orda.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroResponse_Rehgar00=Le formalità non ti si addicono, Rehgar.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroResponse_Rexxar00=Vieni, campione. Abbiamo una battaglia da affrontare.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Kill00=Il tuo fato termina qui!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Kill01=Cadi davanti all'Orda.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Kill02=La terra ti reclama!

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/KillArthas00=Il tuo regno è terminato.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/KillDemon00=L'Orda non si inchina di fronte a nessun demone.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/KillETC00=Manda i miei omaggi alla Madre Terra.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/KillGarrosh00=Mi deludi per l'ennesima volta, Garrosh.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/KillHorde00=Che il tuo spirito trovi la pace.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/KillJaina00=Addio, Jaina.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/KillSpreeEnd00=Mi aspettavo di più.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Laugh06=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/LowLifeHeal00=Il tuo Capoguerra ti ringrazia.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/LowLifeHeal01=Ottimo tempismo, guaritore.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/LowLifeHeal02=Il mio spirito è rinfrancato.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/LowMana00=Sto esaurendo il mana.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/LowMana01=Ho bisogno di più mana.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/LowMana02=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/No00=Impossibile.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/No01=No, amico.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/No02=Non farmi perdere tempo.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AssistHero00=Un alleato ha bisogno di aiuto.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AssistMe00=Datemi aiuto, presto!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AssistMe01=Mi servono rinforzi!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AttackCastle00=Distruggiamo il loro nucleo! Lok'tar!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AttackMerc00=Dovremmo assicurarci i servigi di questi mercenari.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Guerrieri, attaccate il loro forte.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AttackTower00=Impadroniamoci di questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Dobbiamo difendete il forte, immediatamente.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_DefendTower00=Guerrieri, difendete la torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_KillHero00=Abbattete quell'eroe, ora!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed00=Io sono il Capoguerra.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed01=Gli spiriti sono irrequieti.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed02=Hmm? Oh giusto... Ci sono le battute spiritose. Scusate, è passato un po' tempo dall'ultima volta.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed03=<inhales> Ah, mi manca la strategia in tempo reale.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed04=La prospettiva isometrica, le grandi ed epiche battaglie...
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed05=Tutte queste toccatine invece non mi mancavano...
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed06=Non ci vuole un martello grande, ma un grande martello!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed07=Hai voluto il Capoguerra? Impara a guerreggiare.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed08=Mi stai facendo arrabbiare? Non ti piacerà vedermi arrabbiato.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed09=Dai retta al tuo Capoguerra... Non andare in giro a fare sciocchezze solo perché qualcuno urla: "Per l'Orda!"
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed10=Chi è arrivato prima? Martelfato o i Martelfato? Riflettici su.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed11=Ah, vediamo cosa mi hanno dato stavolta... Catena di Fulmini... sempre utile. Lupo Spirituale... Furia del Vento... Mi dispiace, Rehgar... sembra che le abilità migliori me le sia prese tutte io.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed12=Dopo un paio di espansioni di Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard mi sostituirà con Garrosh.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed13=Il colpo che uccise Orgrim intaccò per sempre il dorso di questa corazza. La porto per ricordare che il nemico può colpirti dove meno te l'aspetti.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed14=Come, come, come? Volete dirmi che questo gioco ha una trama? Avete davvero pagato qualcuno per inventarsi un modo in cui Raynor incontra Diablo? Ma allora a cosa serve la fan fiction? <Sigh> Giuro che non è stata un'idea mia.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Resurrected00=Grazie.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Resurrected01=Meno male che ci sei tu.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Revive00=L'Orda non morirà mai.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Revive01=Lok'tar ogar!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Revive02=Gli antenati mi benedicono.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Spec00=Hmmm. Ottima scelta.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Spec01=Hmm. Questa andrà benone.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Spec02=Il potere scorre in me.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Spec03=Gli spiriti sono benevoli.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Spec04=Sì, mi sento già più forte.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Taunt00=Gli elementi ti distruggeranno.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Taunt01=Io sono la furia dell'Orda!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Taunt02=Affronta il figlio di Durotan!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/TeamKilled00=Il nostro spirito non si piega così facilmente.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_ExLocked00=Lok'tar.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_ExPurchased00=Che cosa desideri, amico?
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_Gift00=Il tuo alleato è il mio.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_Lockin00=Gloria all'Orda!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_Purchase00=Per l'Orda!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_Trial00=Bene, lascia che ti mostri come si fa.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_Trial01=Fa' attenzione. Te lo spiego solo una volta.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_WaitLocked00=Lascia che ti mostri il potere degli elementi.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_WaitLocked01=Non attendiamo oltre. C'è una guerra da combattere.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_WaitPurchased00=Mi chiedo che cosa tu abbia di meglio da fare.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_WaitPurchased01=Lo sai che sono un CapoGUERRA, vero?
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate1Used00=Subisci la furia di Martelfato!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate1Used01=Basta!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate1Used02=Gli elementi ti sono ostili!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate1Used03=Finisce ora!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate2Used00=Terra, inghiotti i miei nemici!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate2Used01=Tremate di paura!

VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed03=Stai tirando un po' troppo la corda, bello mio.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed04=Già, non sono granché nel gioco di squadra. Specie se coinvolge uomini vacca, zombi e altri fenomeni da baraccone.

VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Heal00=Sei in brutte condizioni. Prova a bere da una fonte.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Heal01=Troverei una fonte curativa, se fossi in te.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Retreat00=Devo ripiegare.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Retreat01=Devo battere in ritirata, per ora.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh00=Che peccato.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh01=Santo cielo.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh02=Non disperare.
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack00=Per Lordaeron!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack01=La mia giustizia calerà con grandissima vendetta!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack02=Che la Luce vi maledica!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack03=Per la Mano d'Argento!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack04=Badate a voi, nemici della Luce!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack05=La Luce è con noi!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack06=Io sono il martello della Giustizia!
VoiceOver/Uther/Celebrate00=Così si fa!
VoiceOver/Uther/Celebrate01=Non diamogli tregua!
VoiceOver/Uther/Comeback00=Li stiamo agguantando! Non mollate!
VoiceOver/Uther/Death00=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Uther/Death01=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Uther/Death02=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed00=La Luce benedica la tua mano.
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed01=Ti sono grato.
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed02=Ottima cura, amico!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree00=Fai strada.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree01=Ho capito.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree02=Questo è lo spirito giusto!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroBoast00=La Luce ci guiderà alla vittoria.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroBoast01=Ci batteremo con onore!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion00=Pronto a dare una lezione a quei gaglioffi?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion01=Sei pronto?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=Sono sempre orgoglioso di servire accanto a un altro membro dell'Alleanza.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Perché dovrei fidarmi di te, ragazzo?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Quindi tu devi essere una di quei "crociati" di cui ho sentito tanto parlare.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Greymane00=Genn Mantogrigio in persona. Era ora che Gilneas tornasse in battaglia.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Oh. L'Orda... e pensare che questa giornata era iniziata così bene.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Impressed00=Huh, sembra che tu abbia dell'esperienza sul campo di battaglia.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Dama Jaina, è un piacere tornare a combattere al tuo fianco.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Il Re Scheletro, eh? Non hai molta fantasia con i nomi, vero?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_LightVictory00=<Do not record. Reuses Boast00>
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Medic00=Ah! Salute e ben trovata, alleata!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Esattamente cosa vorrebbe significare?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Un negromante, eh? Non posso dire di essere un amante di quelli come te.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Negative00=<scoff> Ah, sei tu...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Salute, amico! Che ne dici di dispensare un po' di Giustizia?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Stitches00=Per la Luce, che razza di abominio sei tu?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Sylvanas? <beat> Hai un aspetto orribile.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Varian, l'ultima volta che t'ho visto eri ancora in fasce.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Sono io, o voi zerg diventate sempre più strani?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zuljin00=Quindi questo è il potente Zul'jin. Uh, non posso dire di essere impressionato.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond00=Sempre.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond01=Sarà un piacere.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond02=Per la Luce!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Gloria all'Alleanza!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Angry00=Questo ti è appena costato una cura. Proprio quando ne avevi bisogno.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Chiudi il becco, prima che te lo chiuda io.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Oh, le mie povere orecchie...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Cranky00=Ai miei tempi, rispettavamo gli anziani. SPECIALMENTE i guaritori!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Per favore... Padroneggiavo la Luce quanto tu avevi ancora i pantaloni corti.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Sì, ho capito, non vedi l'ora di iniziare. Complimenti. Abbiamo finito?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Excited00=Ah! Questa sarà memorabile.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Greymane00=Ah! Mi fa piacere sentirtelo dire, vecchio segugio. <beat> Oh, scusa.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Horde00=Aggiungere "Nuova" davanti a "Orda" non laverà i vostri peccati, lo sai.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Impressed00=Bene, vediamo che sai fare.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Jaina00=La colpa è mia, e dovrò conviverci fino alla fine dei miei giorni.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Non mi stupisce che ti abbiano fatto fuori.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Medic00=Cosa intendi? Sono i miei enormi spallacci dell'aquila? O il martello magico di pronto soccorso?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Mocking00=E ti chiamano eroe? Ah. Mi sono ripulito gli stivali da fango più eroico di te.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Murky00=Puoi ripetere?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Questa mi sembra di averla già sentita.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Negative00=Taci. Abbiamo una battaglia da vincere.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NewRace00=Tu vieni da Azeroth? Non si può abbandonare il pianeta per qualche anno che tutto va in malora.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NightElf00=E io che pensavo che gli Alti Elfi fossero pieni di sé.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ah! Mostriamo a quei bastardi cosa sappiamo fare.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Stitches00=Non ti degnerò nemmeno di una risposta.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=E io che pensavo che la morte rendesse la gente MENO aggressiva.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Uncaring00=Oh, e ti aspetti che me ne importi qualcosa? Aspetta e spera.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Varian00=Per l'Alleanza!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Farai meglio a ricordare chi sono i tuoi alleati, belva.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zuljin00=È proprio il tipo di commento che mi aspetto da un Troll.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill00=Giustizia è fatta.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill01=Vai nella Luce. Adesso!
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill02=Questa è la tua fine.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill03=È finita.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill04=Non ci stai neanche provando!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAlliance00=Ti chiedo perdono.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAngel00=Hmm. Mi sa che ho appena ucciso uno spirito guaritore!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillArthas00=Marcisci all'inferno, ragazzo.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillChogall00=Dopo tutto, sembra che paladini e Magi Ogre non siano così uguali.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillCrusader00=Oh... Che ne è stato di tutti quei discorsi sulla "classe sorpassata"?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDemon00=Torna nel vuoto! O nel luogo da cui provieni!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDiablo00=Questo mondo non dovrà più sopportare i tuoi simili, demone!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillGuldan00=Persino "l'oscurità incarnata" sbiadisce di fronte alla luce.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillHorde00=L'Orda: nuovo aspetto, stessa schifezza.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillJaina00=<sigh> Che disgrazia...
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKaelthas00=Hai ancora molto da imparare, Kael'thas.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKerrigan00=La giustizia è giunta per te, Kerrigan.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillMedivh00=Il mio martello da guerra porterà a termine l'opera iniziata dalla lama di Lothar.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillPaladin00=Cha la Luce abbia pietà della mia anima.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillRaynor00=Pare che tu abbia bisogno di altro addestramento, Raynor.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillScourge00=Finché vivrò, Lorderaeon non cadrà mai tra le mani del Flagello.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillSpreeEnd00=Bel tentativo.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillVarian00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillWar200=Ahh, quanti ricordi...
VoiceOver/Uther/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal00=Meno male che c'eri tu.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal01=Ti devo la vita.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal02=Hai la mia eterna gratitudine, amico!
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana00=Sto esaurendo il mana.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana01=Il mio mana scarseggia.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana02=Sto per finire il mana.
VoiceOver/Uther/No00=No.
VoiceOver/Uther/No01=Non è possibile.
VoiceOver/Uther/No02=Non posso.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistHero00=Un nostro alleato ha bisogno d'aiuto.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe00=Mi farebbe comodo un po' d'aiuto.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe01=C'è qualcuno disposto ad aiutarmi?
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackCastle00=Attaccate il nucleo nemico!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackMerc00=Dobbiamo conquistare questo campo di mercenari.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Attacchiamo questo forte!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackTower00=Occupiamo questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendCastle00=Difendete il nucleo!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Difendete il forte!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendTower00=Dobbiamo difendere la nostra torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_KillHero00=Dobbiamo eliminare questo nemico.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed00=Siamo benedetti dalla Luce.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed01=La Luce risplende su tutti noi.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed02=Sono troppo vecchio per queste sciocchezze.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed03=A volte la luce in fondo al tunnel è un treno.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed04=Oggi sono Uther l'Araldo del Dolore.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed05=Ma cosa... Che fine ha fatto la mano argentea nel cielo?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed06=Insomma, l'Ordine dello Strano Triangolo Celeste non ha neanche lontanamente le stesse prerogative.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed07=Ai miei tempi c'era un solo tipo di paladini, ed eravamo ben felici di averli.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed08=E potevamo arrivare solo a livello 10. A quanto arrivate adesso, a 100? Di più? <sigh> Beata gioventù...
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed09=<SFX: sneeze> Saluce.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed10=Ti dispiace rifarlo, magari un po' più a sinistra stavolta?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed11=Ahh, perfetto.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed12=Che i giusti conoscano la pace, e gli ingiusti il dorso della mia mano.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed13=La mia chiesa è il campo di battaglia. Perché altro dovrei portarmi in giro questo libro? Per bellezza?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed14=A proposito, un piccolo drago di bronzo mi ha detto che cosa voi elfi del sangue volete fare alla mia tomba... e non mi piace affatto.
VoiceOver/Uther/Resurrected00=Lieto che tu sia dalla mia parte.
VoiceOver/Uther/Resurrected01=Tante grazie di avermi salvato. 
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive00=Per l'Alleanza!
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive01=La Giustizia è qui.
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive02=Va bene, riproviamo...
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec00=Saggia decisione.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec01=La fede, è l'unica ricompensa.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec02=Mi sarà utile.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec03=Ottima scelta.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec04=A qualunque costo.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt00=Fammi vedere cosa sai fare.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt01=La codardia non è una virtù.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt02=Fatti crescere la spina dorsale!
VoiceOver/Uther/TeamKilled00=Sto diventando troppo vecchio per queste cose.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_ExLocked00=Salve, straniero.

VoiceOver/WitchDoctor/Pissed02=È ora di farti vedere quel vudù che mi riesce così bene.
VoiceOver/WitchDoctor/Pissed03=Guarda che ho una laurea in PvP.
VoiceOver/WitchDoctor/Pissed04=Questo troll avrebbe dovuto stare lontano dal vudù.
VoiceOver/WitchDoctor/Pissed05=Cosa? No, non lecco i rospi... Cosa te lo fa pensare? <frog croak> Zitto, tu.

VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond02=Non sto nella pelle.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Sai, potremmo anche abbandonare questo scontro e vedercela tra noi.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Non c'è un posto dove non mi tocchi vedere il tuo faccione?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Mm, giusto. Bene.

VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=È un sollievo sapere che non dovrò fare tutto da sola!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Oh, di bene in meglio.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_SpaceLordLeoric00=Nel nome delle stelle, io ti punirò!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Non potrei desiderare di meglio.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=Hm. Forse avrei fatto meglio a continuare gli studi...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill00=Sono inarrestabile!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill01=Sono così brava che mi faccio paura da sola.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill02=Se solo potessero vedermi!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill03=Le tue difese non valgono nulla!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill04=Mi sto solo scaldando!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillAngel00=Mai sottovalutare una nefilim.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillButcher00=Ora chi è "carne fresca"?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDeckard00=Cain, in che pasticcio ti sei cacciato...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDemon00=Non imparerai mai a lasciarmi in pace, vero?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiablo00=Questo era per Leah.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiabloHero00=Uhm, avrei dovuto conoscerti?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillJaina00=Forse avresti dovuto applicarti di più.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillKaelthas00=Voi maghi elfici non potete competere con me...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillLeoric00=Quante volte lo devo fare ancora?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMalthael00=La seconda volta muori molto più rapidamente.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMedivh00=Il duello tra maghi è finito, e tu hai perso!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillNephalem00=Non volevo farlo, lo giuro!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillSpreeEnd00=È stato divertente.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillTyrael00=Le mie scuse, amico...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillWeird00=Va bene, ti ho ucciso, ma non capisco come facessi a vivere. Bleah.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh00=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh01=<small laugh>

VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh03=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh04=<larger laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal00=Grazie per la tua cortesia.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal01=Devo avere un nuovo angelo custode.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ehi, tempismo perfetto!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana00=Ho bisogno di mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana01=Non ho abbastanza Mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana02=Mi serve più mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No00=Perché dovrei?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No01=Assolutamente no.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No02=Non lo farò.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Sarà meglio che l'aiutiamo.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Qualcuno mi aiuta, per favore?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Ho... bisogno d'aiuto.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=È il momento di attaccare il nucleo!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Voglio conquistare questo campo di mercenari.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Attacchiamo questo forte!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Dobbiamo prendere questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Il nucleo non può cadere o perderemo!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Quel forte ha bisogno d'aiuto. Subito!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Faremmo meglio a proteggere questa torre di guardia.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_KillHero00=Dobbiamo uccidere quell'eroe.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed00=Adempirò al mio destino.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed01=Sono sempre stata portata per la magia.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed02=Sì, sono stata io a distruggere il Santuario degli Yshari. Ma non avevo scelta.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed03=Ma qualcuno sta facendo attenzione? Forse tu ne hai fin troppe di attenzioni...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed04=Secondo te ho studiato gli antichi segreti della magia solo per farmi importunare?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed05=Sembra un buon momento per sperimentare il mio incantesimo del silenzio.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed06=Vediamo come te la cavi con questo!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed07=Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed08=Ehm... Io non... non avevo mai fatto un simile errore.  
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed09=Se ne fai parola con qualcuno, giuro che ti spedisco in un'altra dimensione. 
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed10=I miei insegnanti dicevano sempre che ero piena di me. Ma non può essere vero, non ne ho mai abbastanza di me.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed11=Ma che cosa gli fa Eirena agli uomini? Cioè, capisco Lyndon, ma perfino Kormac sembra ipnotizzato quando le parla. Sarà quell'aria da svampita...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed12=Una volta ho usato Saetta Magica contro l'oscurità... quanto se l'è presa...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed13=Perfino nel mondo dei maghi sentire voci non è un buon segno. Hai detto qualcosa?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed14=Isendra era una maestra formidabile, ma non svelava mai tutti i suoi segreti. Ancora mi chiedo come facesse a teletrasportarsi così in fretta, e senza tempo di recupero!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed15=Adoro il potere di questo guanto. È così crudele.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected00=Le tue cure sono quelle che preferisco!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected01=Sei meglio dei sacerdoti di Zakarum!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive00=Pare che oggi non morirò.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive01=Oh, non era questo che avevo in mente...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive02=Dovrei fare più attenzione. O forse no.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec00=Il mio potere cresce.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec01=Ben fatto.

VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed06=Dio salvi la regina! Tutti gli altri possono crepare...
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed07=È dura essere una matriarca single con 4 milioni e mezzo di zerg da sfamare.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed08=Se sono una matriarca... dov'è il mio patriarca?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed09=Quando sarò Regina delle Lame non sarò più costretta a sopportarti.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed10=Quattro anni e sono già Matriarca. Spero che mio padre non venga a scoprirlo.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed11=<long strange zerg sounds> <clears throat> Scusate, a volte non riesco a nascondere il mio accento.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed12=Che stai facendo? Voltati! Non ti hanno insegnato che è scortese guardare una regina nutrire le proprie larve?

VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed02=Quando lo spirto vien men, basta lo brando.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed03=Da non credere quant'è facile infiltrarsi a bordo di un'astronave.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed04=Zeratul, per il trattamento dei sintomi dell'influenza e del raffreddore. È un medicinale alieno. Usare con cautela. Può avere effetti trans-dimensionali. Leggere attentamente il foglietto illustrativo in lingua protoss.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed05=<Sound effect: sneeze> Aspetta, cos'è successo? Come ci sono riuscito?
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed06=Parla lentamente e usa una grossa lama psionica.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed07=Dovrei usare le abilità per attaccare gli eroi nemici. Dovrei anche scoprire perché mi do consigli da solo.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed08=Reco gravi notizie. A dire il vero, no. È solo che mi piace dirlo.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed09=L'oscurità è mia alleata... ma non ci sentiamo molto. La tenebra è molto gelosa.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed10=La profezia parla di un prescelto, che porterà l'equilibrio tra le fo-- ho-ho-ho.. Questa è la profezia sbagliata... <beat> Per un pelo non ci becchiamo una querela.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed11=L'anatomia umana è sconcertante... Voglio dire, con un solo dito opponibile, come fai a reggerti il... insomma... il phylar? Senza offesa, s'intende.
