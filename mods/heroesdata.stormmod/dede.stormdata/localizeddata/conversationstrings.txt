Conversation/CreepVO/Line00066=Davey Jones' nasses Grab erwartet euch!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00067=Helden ... Zollt mir Tribut und ich werde Euch meine Gunst gewähren.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00068=Wer holt sich diesen?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00069=Ich glaube, Ihr schuldet mir Tribut.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00070=Ihr solltet Euch beeilen. <lacht>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00071=Wer wird wohl diesen an sich nehmen?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00072=Tribut für mich!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00073=Der Rabenfürst fordert seinen Tribut ein.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00074=Wer wird um meine Gunst buhlen?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00075=Ich hoffe, dass Ihr Euch beeilen könnt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00076=<lacht> Es ist ein Vergnügen, zuzusehen, wie Ihr gehetzt umherjagt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00077=Wollen wir sehen, wer diesen beansprucht?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00078=Zollt mir Tribut! Ich verlange Tribut!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00079=Wenn Ihr Euch meine Gunst erhofft, solltet Ihr Euch beeilen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00080=Ihr habt meine Gunst errungen, Helden! Mögen Eure Gegner meinen Zorn spüren!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00081=Meine Gunst gehört Euch, Helden! Das Schicksal Eurer Feinde ist besiegelt!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00082=Ich verfluche Euch!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00083=Ein unwürdiger Tribut! Ihr werdet meinen Fluch spüren!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00084=Genug! Der Fluch ist vorbei. Ich hoffe für Euch, dass Ihr das Beste daraus gemacht habt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00085=Mein Fluch vergeht, doch nur vorübergehend.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00086=Große Kanonen, Feuer frei!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00087=Worauf wartet ihr denn? Feuer frei!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00088=<wahnsinniges Lachen>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00089=Haha, nichts als Kanonenfutter!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00090=Macht Haifutter aus ihnen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00091=Wartet nicht auf mich! Feuert, ihr Strohköpfe!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00092=Der alte Schwarzherz hat ein kleines Geschenk für euch! Haha!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00093=Wir sind dran, Jungs! <lacht> Jetzt kommt Leben in diese Bude!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00094=Nachladen, Männer!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00095=Schnell, noch eine Runde!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00097=Kanonen laden!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00098=Schluss mit Nichtstun, sonst kielhole ich euch alle!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00099=Zeigt diesen räudigen Landratten, wie Piraten kämpfen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00100=Nur weil du tot bist, heißt das noch lange nicht, dass du auf der faulen Haut liegen kannst! Kanonen nachladen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00101=Nachladen, sonst steck ich deinen Schädel da rein!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00102=Nachladen, schnell!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00104=Ich glaube, sie haben genug! Haha!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00105=Sie haben alle gezahlt? Ach, wen kümmert's! Jetzt geht der Spaß los!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00106=Wir haben eine Abmachung. Schickt diese Küstenschiffer zu den Haien!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00107=Tja, da war euer Gegner wohl schneller! Ich hoffe, ihr habt eure Lektion gelernt!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00108=Der Feind hat es auf euch abgesehen! Haha!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00109=Sieht so aus, als ob euer Feind bezahlt hätte! Feuer frei, ihr Nichtsnutze!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00110=Rückt eure Dublonen raus, dann richte ich meine Kanonen vielleicht auf eure Feinde anstatt auf euch!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00111=Wollen wir sehen, wer mir dieses Mal genügend Tribut zollt?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00112=Zollt mir Tribut oder stellt Euch meinem Fluch. Ihr habt die Wahl.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00113=Ich bin Eurer lächerlichen Streitereien überdrüssig. Zollt mir Tribut und erringt meine Gunst!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00114=Feuert weiter, Männer! Wir wurden gebührend entlohnt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00115=Genug Dublonen für noch 'ne Runde!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00116=<lacht> Diese Landratten machen mich reich! Weiterfeuern!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00117=Sieht so aus, als ob euer Feind die Abmachung geändert hätte! Haha!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00118=Für euren Gegner sieht es immer besser aus!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00119=Meine Kanonen sind käuflich. Und euer Feind wird das zu spüren kriegen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00120=Das ist nicht euer Tag, was? Pech gehabt! Weiterfeuern!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00121=Zeit für die nächste Runde!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00122=Ich hoffe, ihr seid bereit für mehr!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00123=Arr! Der Wind dreht sich zu euren Gunsten!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00124=Yarr, harr ... Meine Kanonen stehen euch zu Diensten!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00125=Richtet die Kanonen auf ihren Feind! Sollen sie kriegen, wofür sie bezahlt haben!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00183=Machen wir's interessanter! Dublonen für jeden, der diese Truhe öffnet.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00184=Wisst ihr was? Schätze für alle! Aber am meisten für mich. <lacht>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00185=Ihr denkt, ihr könnt beide Truhen öffnen, ihr Süßwassermatrosen?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00186=Was wäre ein Pirat ohne Schätze? <lacht>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00187=Heute gibt's keine Schatzsuche. Der Schatz ist da, vor eurer Nase. Holt ihn euch!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00188=Wollen wir mal sehen, ob ihr mit zwei Truhen klarkommt!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00189=Ich hoffe, ihr habt Lust auf ein paar Schätze, Kameraden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00190=Zehn kleine Helden auf des toten Mannes Kiste! Yo ho ho! Wo ist nur meine Buddel hin?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00198=Jetzt werdet Ihr meinen Zorn spüren.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00200=Und jetzt ist Euer Untergang besiegelt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00202=Ich stehe euch zu Diensten ... für den Moment. Ladet die Kanonen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00207=Arr! Unsere Abmachung ist besiegelt. Zeigen wir's diesen Leichtmatrosen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00234=Man munkelt, am Pier gäbe es Schätze zu erbeuten ... Schnappt sie euch!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00235=Das reicht! Wir malochen nicht umsonst!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00236=Nun denn ... Bringt mir eure Dublonen für meine Dienste. <düsteres Lachen>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00237=Arr! Arr! ... Was guckt ihr so? Das macht Spaß!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00238=Feuer, sonst packe ich deinen Schädel ins Kanonenrohr!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00239=Schnappt euch diese fette Beute!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00242=Wer holt sich meine Beute zuerst? <lacht>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00247=Na, was haben wir hier? Noch mehr Süßwassermatrosen auf dem Weg in die Schwarzherzbucht, hm?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00248=Ahoi, ihr Landratten! Hier zollt ihr gefälligst dem Kapitän euren Respekt. Und für diesen Kapitän zählt nur eins: bare Münze! Haha!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00249=Mir gleich, wie ihr Lumpen sie beschafft.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00250=Diebstahl ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00251=Mord ... egal!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00252=Kreuzt einfach bei meinem Schiff auf und rückt die Dublonen heraus! Dann kann euer Gegner was von mir erwarten! Hahaha!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00254=Dieses Reich steht unter MEINEM Schutz und beugt sich MEINEM Willen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00255=Wenn Ihr siegen wollt, dann sammelt in meinem Namen Tribut.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00256=Den Eifrigsten gewähre ich meine Gunst.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00257=Eure Gegner werden fallen ... Ihre Verteidigung wird nutzlos sein.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00258=Dann solltet Ihr die Gunst der Stunde nutzen ... mein Wohlwollen wird nicht ewig währen. Hehehe.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00259=Was sagt Ihr? Seid Ihr bereit?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00260=Ihr wagt Euch in das verfluchte Tal? <lacht> Wie amüsant.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00261=Die Minen öffnen sich bald ... die Untoten werden erwachen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00262=Der Tod regt sich in den Minen ... Werdet Ihr der Dunkelheit trotzen?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00263=Seid Ihr bereit, gegen die Untoten zu kämpfen? Die Minen werden sich bald öffnen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00264=Die Toten werden zum Leben erweckt. Wagt Ihr es, die Minen zu betreten?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00265=Jetzt gibt es kein Zurück mehr ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00266=Tretet ein, Helden! Die Verdammten erwarten Euch.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00267=Hört Ihr dieses Klappern? <düster> Ich glaube, sie haben Hunger ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00268=Erhebt euch, Golems! Erhebt euch und lasst eurer Wut freien Lauf!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00269=Meine Golems erwachen zu neuem Leben!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00270=Die Zeit ist gekommen: Meine Golems kehren zurück.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00271=Ausgezeichnet, Euer Golem ist stärker als der Eurer Feinde.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00272=Euer Grabgolem erhebt sich. Doch er ist schwächer als der Eurer Feinde.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00273=Die Golems scheinen gleich stark zu sein.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00274=Die Golems kehren zurück ... Eurer ist weitaus stärker.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00275=Vortrefflich! Euer Golem ist weitaus stärker als der Eurer Feinde.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00276=Die Golems erheben sich ... doch nehmt Euch in Acht, denn Eurer ist weitaus schwächer als der Eurer Gegner.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00277=Wenn Ihr Euch einen stärkeren Golem erhofft, werdet Ihr mehr Schädel sammeln müssen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00278=Die Golems wurden wieder zum Leben erweckt. Sie sind von fast gleicher Stärke.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00279=Hmm. Die Golems scheinen beinahe gleich stark zu sein.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00280=Meine Golems kehren zurück ... Das sollte unterhaltsam werden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00281=Lasst eurer Wut freien Lauf!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00282=Haltet Euch fest, hier wird es gleich richtig gespenstisch.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00283=<düsteres Lachen>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00284=Wunderbar, gleich beginnt die Hauptattraktion.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00285=Das sollte richtig gruselig werden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00286=Willkommen in den Geisterminen, törichte Helden. Hier herrscht der ewige Tod ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00287=Bald werden sich die Geisterminen öffnen ... und das Grauen im Innern wird erwachen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00288=<lacht> Womöglich können wir einen Pakt eingehen, der uns allen dienlich ist.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00289=Erschlagt die Untoten. Raubt ihnen ihre verfluchten Schädel.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00290=Daraufhin werde ich meine mächtigen Knochengolems vom Tode erwecken.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00291=Sie werden die Verteidigung Eurer Gegner in Schutt und Asche legen ... Seid Ihr interessiert?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00292=Die alten Schreine erwachen! Kontrolliert sie und setzt den Drachenritter frei!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00293=Die Macht der Schreine wächst. Der Drachenritter ruft aus dem Stein.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00294=Bald werden die Schreine erwachen ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00295=Macht erfüllt die Schreine. Entfesselt den Zorn des Drachen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00296=Aktiviert die Schreine jetzt, dann gehört die Macht des Drachen Euch.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00297=Der Drache soll nicht länger ruhen ... Entfesselt seine Macht!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00298=Aktiviert die Schreine. Nehmt die Macht des Drachenritters in Anspruch!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00299=Befreit den Drachenritter und bringt Euren Feinden den Tod!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00300=Es ist Zeit! Setzt den Drachenritter frei!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00301=Die Macht des Drachen gehört Euch!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00302=Zwingt Eure Feinde zu Boden!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00303=Euer Gegner beherrscht die Schreine ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00304=Jetzt müsst Ihr Euch dem Zorn des Drachen stellen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00305=Eure Zeit neigt sich dem Ende zu.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00306=Lasst Eure Feinde brennen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00307=Eure Feinde werden zu Asche zerfallen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00308=Ich lebe wieder!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00309=Ihr werdet brennen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00310=Die Flammen läutern alles.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00311=Von Euch wird nichts als Asche übrig bleiben.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00312=Ich werde nicht in dieses Gefängnis zurückkehren! Nein!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00313=Nein ... Mein Werk ist noch nicht vollendet!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00314=Die Drachen werden wieder herrschen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00315=Die Drachen erheben Anspruch auf dieses Land!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00316=Dies sind die Drachengärten. Sind sie nicht wunderschön? Und doch basieren sie auf einer Lüge ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00317=Das Volk hat meine Vorfahren vergessen. Sie haben vergessen, dass hier einst Drachen herrschten.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00318=Aktiviert Sonnen- und Mondschrein, dann wird die Magie schwinden, die meinen Drachenritter gefangen hält.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00319=Seine Macht wird Euch erfüllen und Eure Gegner werden in Flammen aufgehen. Dieses Land soll an sein wahres Erbe erinnert werden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00320=Der Drache WIRD wiederauferstehen. Beherrscht seine Macht oder sie wird Euer Ende sein. Ihr entscheidet.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00321=Euer Golem ist schwächer als der Eures Gegners. Bereitet Eure Verteidigung vor.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00322=Die Golems sind von ähnlicher Stärke. Wappnet Euch.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00323=Die Beschwörung ist vollendet, und Euer Golem ist stärker als der des Gegners.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00324=Euer Golem ist stärker als der des Gegners. Macht es Euch zunutze.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00325=Ein schwacher Golem. Sammelt mehr Schädel.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00326=Es ist vollbracht. Euer Golem ist gleich stark wie der Eures Gegners.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00327=Sprengt die Fesseln und zerstört eure Feinde!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00328=Erschlagt die Untoten und nehmt ihre Schädel an Euch.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00329=Sammelt Schädel und stärkt Euren Golem!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00330=Die Verdammten kehren bald zurück. Wappnet Euch.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00331=Hört zu, Ihr Helden ... Bald werden die Untoten in den Minen erwachen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00332=Erhebt euch, meine Golems, und lasst eurer Wut freien Lauf!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00333=Die Schreine erwachen erneut. Wer wird den Drachenritter beherrschen?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00334=Der Drache wartet! Befreit ihn und vernichtet Eure Feinde.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00335=Die Zeit ist gekommen! Entfesselt die Macht des Drachen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00336=Euer Ende ist nah, denn der Drache wird durch die Hand Eurer Feinde auferstehen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00337=Euer Gegner wird zugrunde gehen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00338=Die Flammen werden Euch holen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00339=Die Zeit ... verrinnt ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00340=Helden, schon bald ist es Nacht ... Ich hoffe, ihr seid bereit.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00341=Die Nacht ist angebrochen. Ich liebe den Anblick meines Gartens im Mondlicht.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00342=Die Nacht bricht erneut herein. Bald werden sich die Unkrautler wieder erheben.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00343=Bald schon wird es Nacht sein, Helden. Vergesst nicht: Tötet die Unkrautler und ergattert ihre Samen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00344=Die Nacht bricht in 30 Sekunden herein. Seid ihr bereit, euch zu vergnügen?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00345=Die Unkrautler erheben sich! Tötet sie ... Erntet ihre Samen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00346=Die Unkrautler erheben sich ... Erschlagt sie und sammelt ihre Samen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00347=Es ist so weit ... Tut, was getan werden muss.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00348=Die Unkrautler erheben sich erneut. Befreit meine Samen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00349=Schlachtet sie alle ab und erlangt meine Samen zurück!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00350=Die Morgendämmerung ... beeilt euch, Helden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00351=Der Morgen dämmert ... Unsere Zeit ist beinahe vorüber.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00352=Ein Lichtstrahl. Der Tag bricht an.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00353=<Wütendes Fauchen> Die garstige Sonne ... Schnell, gewinnt meine Samen zurück ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00358=Ihr habt genug Samen gesammelt. Bringt sie zu mir ... ich werde eurem schwachen Fleisch ungeahnte Macht verleihen ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00359=Endlich habt ihr genug Samen. Kommt ... werdet der Stolz meines Gartens.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00360=Sät diese Samen ... und labt euch an der Furcht eurer Gegner.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00361=Pflanzt die Samen, Helden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00362=Kommt jetzt und pflanzt die Samen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00363=Fordert mich nicht heraus. Sät die Samen aus ... nutzt meine Macht.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00364=Geht zur fruchtbaren Erde ... pflanzt die Samen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00365=Pflanzt die Samen, ihr Fleischsäcke!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00366=Euer Ungeheuer lebt! Los! Erntet die Leichen eurer Gegner.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00367=Hervorragend. Macht euch auf den Weg und reißt die Forts eurer Gegner nieder.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00368=Erhebe dich, mein Ungeheuer! Saug deinen Feinden das Leben aus!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00369=Euer Gegner züchtet ein Ungeheuer.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00370=Das gegnerische Ungeheuer erblüht.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00371=Bald schon wird euer Gegner über ein Ungeheuer verfügen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00372=Euer Ungeheuer ist zum Leben erwacht.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00373=Endlich habt ihr euer Ungeheuer ins Leben gerufen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00374=Euer Ungeheuer erblüht. Betet, dass es stärker ist als das eurer Gegner.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00375=Euer Gegner hat ein Ungeheuer gezüchtet.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00376=Euer Gegner hat jetzt ein eigenes Ungeheuer!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00377=Helden, euer Gegner hat ein Ungeheuer zum Leben erweckt!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00378=Nein! Mein bildschönes Ungeheuer ist verwelkt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00379=Euer Ungeheuer ist gefallen. Ihr seid erneut nichts weiter als Fleisch und Blut.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00380=Euer Ungeheuer, mein Kind, ist gefallen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00381=Das Ungeheuer eures Gegners wurde kompostiert.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00382=Das Ungeheuer des Gegners ist gefallen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00383=Das gegnerische Ungeheuer ist nun nichts weiter als verdorrte Blätter.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00384=Euer Ungeheuer ist gefallen, doch das des Gegners lebt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00385=Das Ungeheuer des Gegners lebt noch!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00386=Jetzt seid ihr auf euch allein gestellt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00387=Niemand kann euch aufhalten! Vernichtet sie!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00388=Ja ... weist meinem Ungeheuer den Weg. Tötet sie alle!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00389=Ihr Ungeheuer geht ein. Los ... erntet ihre Leichen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00394=Ihr habt genug Samen gesammelt! Pflanzt sie ein und sie werden eurem schwachen Fleisch ungeahnte Kräfte verleihen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00395=Endlich habt ihr genug Samen. Pflanzt sie hier und werdet der Stolz meines Gartens.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00396=Gute Arbeit, Helden. Pflanzt diese Samen hier ein und trinkt die Furcht eurer Gegner.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00397=Ein Ungeheuer ist erblüht!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00398=Ein Ungeheuer ist zum Leben erwacht.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00399=Ein Ungeheuer ist erblüht!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00400=Ein Ungeheuer ist zum Leben erwacht.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00401=<gähnt> Die Sonne geht auf ... Für den Augenblick müssen meine Kinder ruhen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00402=Anscheinend habt ihr eine weitere Nacht überlebt. Erbaulich.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00403=Der Morgen dämmert, Helden, und nun müssen meine lieben Kinder ruhen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00404=Für den Moment ist es vorbei ... aber ihr solltet euch nicht ausruhen. Die Verseuchten werden zurückkehren.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00405=Ah, Helden. <lacht> Werdet Zeuge, wie mein Garten zum Leben erwacht.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00406=Nachts verwandeln wir uns ... und der Garten der Ängste erblüht.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00407=Tötet die hirnlosen Unkrautler und nehmt ihre Samen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00408=Sobald Ihr genug habt, verleihe ich Euch die Macht der Natur.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00411=Kommt und pflanzt die Vernichtung eurer Gegner.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00412=Pflanzt diese Samen. Jetzt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00413=Worauf wartet ihr? Ihr habt die Samen ... verwendet sie!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00414=Geht zur Erde und sät eure Samen aus, schnell!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00415=Pflanzt die Samen ... Es mag Tag sein, doch ich kann euch immer noch Macht gewähren.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00416=Da! Euer Ungeheuer ist zum Leben erwacht! Erntet mit ihm die Leichen eurer Gegner.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00417=Gut gemacht! Das Ungeheuer wird sich auf die gegnerischen Forts stürzen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00418=Ausgezeichnet. Das Ungeheuer wird euren Gegnern den Lebenssaft entziehen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00419=Euer Gegner hat ein Ungeheuer gezüchtet. Interessant.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00420=Ich sage es nur ungern, aber euer Gegner hat ein Ungeheuer!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00421=Für eure Gegner ist ein Ungeheuer herangewachsen, Helden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00422=Euer Ungeheuer ist zum Leben erwacht. Ist es nicht wunderschön?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00423=Jetzt wäre ein guter Zeitpunkt für ein Ungeheuer.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00424=Euer Ungeheuer ist herangewachsen. Ob es stärker als das eurer Gegner ist?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00425=Helden, euer Gegner hat ebenfalls ein Ungeheuer gezüchtet!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00426=Oh, oh. Mir scheint, dass auch euer Gegner jetzt ein eigenes Ungeheuer hat!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00427=Euer Gegner hat ein Ungeheuer erschaffen, Helden!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00428=Euer Ungeheuer ist verkümmert.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00429=Euer Ungeheuer ist nur noch Kompost.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00430=Euer Ungeheuer wurde getrimmt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00431=Gut gemacht! Das gegnerische Ungeheuer ist eingegangen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00432=Ihr habt das gegnerische Ungeheuer vernichtet.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00433=Exzellent! Das gegnerische Ungeheuer ist nun nichts weiter als verdorrte Blätter.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00434=Euer Ungeheuer ist gefallen, doch das eurer Gegner ist in voller Blüte, Helden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00435=Helden, das gegnerische Ungeheuer lebt noch!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00436=Hoffentlich könnt ihr eure Gegner ohne mein Ungeheuer aufhalten ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00437=Das Ungeheuer eures Gegners ist gefallen! Macht ihnen Druck!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00438=Ihr habt ihr Ungeheuer ordentlich gestutzt! Gar nicht so schlecht, Helden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00439=Ihr Ungeheuer wurde vernichtet! Nur weiter mit der Ernte, Helden!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00440=Welch eine freudige Nacht ... um verflucht zu sein.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00442=Breitet meine Verseuchung aus. Die Sporenkönigin verlangt es ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00443=Endlich habt Ihr genug Samen. Das Ungeheuer wächst erneut heran.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00444=Ihr habt genug Samen gesammelt! Ich sehe ein hübsches Ungeheuer heranwachsen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00445=Gut gemacht, Helden. Schon bald könnt Ihr das Gartenungeheuer kontrollieren.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00446=Das wären dann genug Samen. Lasst mein Ungeheuer heranwachsen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00447=Das Ungeheuer wartet, Helden. Reißt seine Macht an Euch.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00448=Worauf wartet Ihr? Kein Ungeheuer lebt ewig.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00449=Euer Ungeheuer verwelkt. Ich würde mich an Euer Stelle beeilen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00450=Habt ihr etwas Besseres vor? Erweckt mein Ungeheuer!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00452=Zu spät, Helden. Ihr habt mein Geschenk verschmäht ... Ihr seid selbst schuld!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00453=Ihr lasst mein Ungeheuer direkt verwelken? Ha, Narren.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00454=Euer Ungeheuer ist verwelkt ... Welch eine Verschwendung.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00455=Eine Schande, Euer Ungeheuer ist verwelkt, dabei war es solch ein Prachtexemplar ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00457=Erntet die Früchte Eurer Bemühungen, Helden. Erweckt mein Ungeheuer zum Leben.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00459=Schließt Euer Ungeheuer ins Herz. Glaubt mir, an ihm werdet Ihr viel Freude haben.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00460=Ihr habt genug Samen. Das Ungeheuer wächst heran!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00461=Endlich habt ihr genug Samen. Spürt ihr, wie das Ungeheuer wächst?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00462=Ja, das genügt. Schon bald wird das Gartenungeheuer euch gehören.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00463=Das sind genug Samen. Lasst jetzt mein Ungeheuer heranwachsen!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00464=Das Ungeheuer wartet. Kommt, holt euch seine Macht.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00465=Zögert nicht. Euer Ungeheuer braucht seinen Wirt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00468=Euer Ungeheuer verwelkt. Lasst nicht alles umsonst gewesen sein.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00469=Das Ungeheuer kann nicht lange warten ... Nutzt seine Macht.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00470=Zeit für die Ernte. Erweckt mein Ungeheuer zum Leben.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00472=Nutzt euer Ungeheuer. Tötet eure Gegner!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00473=Ihr verschmäht mein Geschenk? Ihr werdet schon sehen, was ihr davon habt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00474=Mein Ungeheuer verwelkt? Narren!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00475=Euer Ungeheuer ist verwelkt ... Welch eine Verschwendung.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00476=Wie könnt ihr es wagen, mein Ungeheuer verwelken zu lassen ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00477=Meine Golems sind gefallen. Einerlei! Hier herrscht ja kein Mangel an Schädeln.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00478=Die Golems wurden besiegt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00479=Wie es aussieht, sind meine Golems zur Erde zurückgekehrt. Vorerst ...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00480=Die Golems werden zurückkehren, Helden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00481=Und so fallen die Knochengolems. Staub zu Staub, wie es so schön heißt.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00482=Der Fluch sei aufgehoben! Bis wieder jemand meine Gunst erringt natürlich.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00483=Und so endet der Fluch. Vielleicht wisst Ihr ihn jetzt zu schätzen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00484=Gut gemacht. Eure Feinde werden geschwächt. Seht ihnen beim Sterben zu!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00485=Mein Fluch lastet auf Euch, Helden. Werdet Ihr ihn überleben?

Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00004=Jeden Tag ein neuer Segen! Aber natürlich nur, wenn ihr mich fangen könnt!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00006=Oh, du bist es wieder! Schließ dich mit deinen Freunden zusammen, dann finden wir heraus, ob ihr mich diesmal fangen könnt! <lacht>
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00007=Was meint ihr, Kinder? Seid ihr bereit für eine weitere Runde?
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00008=Das ist so ein tolles Spiel! Arbeitet zusammen, dann werdet ihr mich diesmal sicher fangen.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00009=Oh, erneut hallo! <lacht> Werden du und deine Freunde mich vielleicht diesmal zu fassen kriegen? <lacht>
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00010=Ihr müsst zusammenarbeiten, um mit mir mitzuhalten, ihr Jungspunde! <lacht>
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00011=Das macht mir so viel Spaß! Lasst es uns doch wiederholen, ja?
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00012=Haben wir heute nicht schon einmal gespielt? Ach egal. Fang mich gemeinsam mit deinen Freunden, falls ihr es schafft! <lacht>
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00014=Gut gemacht, Helden. Mögen Hoffnung und Glück eure Zukunft begleiten. <lacht>
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00015=<lacht> Das ... das war wundervoll! Mein Segen sei mit euch, Helden.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00017=<lacht> Ihr habt mich wieder gefangen. Oho. Wundervoll!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00018=Dieses Spiel wird auch einfach nicht langweilig. <lacht> Gut gemacht, Helden!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00019=Das könnte ich den ganzen Tag machen! Danke, dass ihr mir diese Freude bereitet. <lacht>
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00020=Oh, eine spannende Jagd. Euch erwarten gesegnete Zeiten.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00021=Oh, eure Macht wächst, Helden. Ich sehe, dass mein Segen Früchte trägt. <lacht>
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00023=Das war knapp ... Doch kein Grund zur Sorge, wir werden uns wiedersehen. Hohoho.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00024=Ihr könnt es gerne erneut versuchen, Helden. Arbeitet zusammen und gebt niemals auf!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00025=Ich komme bald wieder, Helden. Bis zum nächsten Mal. <lacht>
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00026=Schauen wir mal, ob ihr mich fangen könnt. Nur die Listigen erhalten meinen Segen! <lacht>
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00027=Höchst beeindruckend, Helden! Ihr habt euch meinen Segen verdient. Möge das Glück mit euch sein!
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00028=Erstaunlich, ihr habt mich gefangen! <lacht> Möge euch mein Segen Glück spenden.
Conversation/LunarNewYearEvent/Line00029=Haha! Ich liebe dieses Spiel. Seid freundlich und spielt fair, Helden. <lacht>

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00003=Ahhhhh!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00004=Seid gegrüßt ... Ich bin Uther der Lichtbringer und Ihr wurdet vom Nexus auserwählt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00005=Vom Nexus? (Pause, denkt darüber nach) Dann stecken also die Protoss dahinter?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00006=Was? Nein, das ... Hört mal ...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00007=Der Nexus ist ein kosmischer Sturm, in dem Welten ungeachtet von Zeit, Raum und Dimensionen aufeinanderprallen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00008=Ihr wurdet hierhergerufen, um Euch in der Schlacht zu beweisen und großen Ruhm zu erringen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00009=Ruhm? Dabei hatte mich "Hallo" schon überzeugt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00010=Dieses Sturmtor bringt uns zum Rabenhof, einem der vielen Reiche des Nexus. Bewegt Euch mit Rechtsklick dorthin.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00011=Dieses Sturmtor bringt uns zum Rabenhof, einem der vielen Reiche des Nexus. Bewegt Euch mit Linksklick dorthin.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00012=Dieses Sturmtor bringt uns zum Rabenhof, einem der vielen Reiche des Nexus. Klickt darauf, um Euch dorthin zu bewegen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00013=Hey, das ist nicht mein erstes Rodeo, Uther. Ich weiß, wie man läuft ...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00014=Das bezweifle ich nicht, mein Freund, doch hier ticken die Uhren anders. Besser, Ihr lernt das jetzt gleich.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00015=Ein gegnerischer Diener? Jetzt schon? ... Na dann, drückt "A" und führt per Linksklick einen Angriff aus.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00017=Ein gegnerischer Diener? Jetzt schon? ... Na dann, drückt die Angreifen-Taste und klickt ihn danach an.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00018=Rücken wir vor. Ihr könnt weitere Diener vor Euch auf der Minikarte sehen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00019=Willst du mir nicht zur Hand gehen, Uther?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00020=Ich habe mein Tutorial bereits abgeschlossen, Junge. Außerdem glaube ich, dass Ihr mit ein paar Dienern fertigwerdet.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00021=Ist da eben eine leuchtende Kugel aus dem Ding rausgeplatzt?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00022=Eine Regenerationskugel. Bewegt Euch zu ihr, damit Ihr und Verbündete in der Nähe Lebenspunkte und Mana regeneriert.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00023=Ich spüre, wie meine Kraft zurückkehrt!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00024=Das war eine Regenerationskugel. Sie regeneriert bei Euch und Verbündeten in der Nähe Lebenspunkte und Mana.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00025=Drückt die "A"-Taste und linksklickt auf den Boden, um Euch auf einen Ort zuzubewegen und dabei unterwegs Gegner anzugreifen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00027=Drückt die Angreifen-Taste und linksklickt auf den Boden, um Euch auf einen Ort zuzubewegen und dabei unterwegs Gegner anzugreifen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00028=Gut gemacht. Wir haben es in die Stadt geschafft.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00029=Immer langsam mit den jungen Pferden ... Bevor ich irgendwohin gehe, musst du mir sagen, was auf mich zukommt ... Was ist dieser Nexus eigentlich?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00030=Der Nexus ist ein kosmischer Sturm, in dem Welten ungeachtet von Zeit, Raum und Dimensionen aufeinanderprallen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00031=Immer mehr von uns werden in dieses rätselhafte Reich geholt und müssen sich in der Hitze der Schlacht gegen gleich starke Gegner beweisen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00032=Also bin ich hier, um zu kämpfen?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00033=Und um Ruhm zu erringen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00034=Okay. Damit kenn ich mich aus ... Auf geht's!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00035=Diablo?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00036=Ihr wagt es, dem Herrn des Schreckens zu trotzen?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00037=(Lacht) Ich frage mich ... Wie schmeckt deine Angst, Sterblicher?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00038=Ich hab keinen Schimmer. Ich weiß nicht mal, ob man Angst überhaupt schmecken kann ...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00039=(Brüllt) Ich werde dich verschlingen!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00040=Der hinterlässt nicht gerade den besten Eindruck. Ich glaube, ich bring ihm besser mal ein paar Manieren bei.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00041=Dann erzähl mir mal, was hier eigentlich los ist.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00042=Dieses Reich nennt man den Rabenhof ... und es scheint vom Dämonenfürsten Diablo belagert zu werden.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00043=Fähigkeiten erscheinen auf der Aktionsleiste am unteren Bildschirmrand.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00044=Wenn Ihr es mit Diablo aufnehmen wollt, müsst Ihr das Beste aus Euren Fähigkeiten machen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00045=Probiert Eure Durchschlagsmunition zuerst gegen Diablos untote Soldaten aus.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00046=Probiert Eure Durchschlagsmunition zuerst gegen Diablos Diener aus.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00047=Nur Geduld, Junge. Zielt genau und versucht es erneut.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00048=Drückt die "Q"-Taste und zielt dann mit dem Pfeil auf die Skelette. Feuert danach mittels Linksklick.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00050=Aktiviert Eure Durchschlagsmunition und zielt mit dem Pfeil auf die Skelette. Feuert dann per Klick, sobald Ihr bereit seid.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00051=Rechtsklicken bricht eine Fähigkeit ab. Wenn der Zielpfeil angezeigt wird, feuert mit Linksklick.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00053=Drückt die "Q"-Taste und zielt dann mit dem Pfeil auf die Gegner. Feuert danach mittels Linksklick.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00055=Aktiviert Eure Durchschlagsmunition und zielt mit dem Pfeil auf die Gegner. Feuert dann per Klick, sobald Ihr bereit seid.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00056=Richtet den Zielpfeil auf die Gegner aus, nachdem Ihr "Q" gedrückt habt, und feuert dann mittels Linksklick.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00058=Sobald Ihr die Durchschlagsmunition aktiviert habt, zielt mit dem Pfeil auf die Gegner und feuert per Klick.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00059=Drückt die "Q"-Taste und zielt dann mit dem Pfeil auf die Gegner. Feuert danach mittels Linksklick.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00061=Aktiviert Eure Durchschlagsmunition und zielt mit dem Pfeil auf die Gegner. Feuert dann per Klick.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00062=Ganz genau! Fähigkeiten verursachen mehr Schaden als Standardangriffe.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00063=Da vorn sind noch mehr Skelette. Benutzt Durchschlagsmunition, um sie zu besiegen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00064=Da vorn sind noch mehr Diener. Nutzt Eure Durchschlagsmunition, um sie zu besiegen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00065=Guter Schuss, Junge!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00066=Du solltest das auch mal ausprobieren, Uther. Es ist sehr viel effektiver, als mit dem Hammer herumzufuchteln.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00067=Denkt daran: Mit Durchschlagsmunition könnt Ihr Gruppen von Dienern auf einen Schlag töten.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00068=Da vorn sind zu viele Skelette ... Wir müssen uns zurückziehen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00069=Oh, das ist nicht gut. Die Jungs verlieren ihren Kampfeswillen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00070=Eure Fähigkeit "Mut machen" ermutigt Euren Helden und Eure Verbündeten.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00071=Ihr müsst diesen Fußsoldaten Mut machen und den Kampf fortsetzen!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00072=Ich kann es mit jedem aufnehmen! Angriff!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00073=Werd nicht übermütig, Kleiner ...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00074="Mut machen" erhöht Eure Angriffsgeschwindigkeit und die naher Verbündeter. Nutzt es, so oft Ihr könnt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00075="Mut machen" verstärkt Euch und Verbündete in Eurer Nähe. Nutzt es, so oft Ihr könnt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00076=Denkt daran: Während Eure Diener kämpfen, könnt Ihr mit Durchschlagsmunition ganze Skelettgruppen töten.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00077=Euren Dienern Mut zu machen ist nützlich, um die Skelette effizienter zu besiegen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00078=Euer neu entdeckter Mut wird euch nicht retten. Eure erbärmlichen Leben enden hier.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00079=Unsere Fußsoldaten greifen weiter vorne Diablo an. Entsperrt Eure Kamera und seht es Euch an.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00080=Genau so. Jetzt scrollt die Karte. Dann sehen wir mal, was Diablo so treibt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00081=Brennt im Höllenfeuer!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00082=Er ist verletzt! Eure Zeit zum Zuschlagen ist gekommen!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00083=Ihr könnt die Leertaste drücken, um die Kamera jederzeit auf Euren Helden zu zentrieren.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00084=Bringt die Kamera zurück zu Eurem Helden und dann legen wir los!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00085=Wenn Ihr wünscht, könnt Ihr die Kamera wieder fixieren, indem Ihr erneut die "L"-Taste drückt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00086=Wenn Ihr wünscht, könnt Ihr die Kamera auch wieder fixieren.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00087=Dieses Reich und all seine verdammten Seelen gehören mir!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00088=Nicht, solange ich funktionsfähig bin!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00089=Diablo ist gefährlich. Stoßt ihn mit der Durchschlagsmunition zurück.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00090=Ich werde deine Seele bis in alle Ewigkeit jagen, James Raynor.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00091=Gut gemacht, Junge! Aber es ist noch nicht vorbei.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00092=Verwendet Euren Ruhestein, um zu mir zu gelangen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00093=Bleibt stehen, während die Magie des Ruhesteins ihr Werk verrichtet.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00094=(Pfeift) Wie raffiniert ...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00095=Dies ist die Halle der Stürme. Wenn die Schlacht beginnt, werden die Helden hierhergerufen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00096=Unser Ziel ist es, die Zitadelle des Gegners zu zerstören und unsere eigene zu schützen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00097=Beide Zitadellen rufen Diener herbei, die diesen Weg entlanggehen und einander in endlosen Wellen bekämpfen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00098=Verstanden. Diablos Zitadelle zerstören und fertig ... Klingt einfach genug. Aber sag mir: Warum machen wir das hier gleich wieder?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00099=(Seufzt) Wisst Ihr ... Ihr solltet Euch nicht so sehr den Kopf zerbrechen ...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00100=Begebt Euch als Erstes zur Front.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00101=Kleiner will spielen!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00102=Der ist wohl nicht der Hellste ... Ein Fort ganz allein anzugreifen ist praktisch Selbstmord.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00103=Unsere Diener helfen Euch dabei, zur gegnerischen Zitadelle vorzudringen. Bleibt hinter ihnen geschützt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00104=Achtung! Greift Türme nur an, wenn diese anderweitig beschäftigt sind.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00105=Gut gemacht, Junge! Ihr habt Euch als würdig erwiesen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00106=Was soll ich sagen? Ich habe halt ein Talent dafür, Dinge explodieren zu lassen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00107=Diener und Steine sind keine Herausforderung! Jetzt werde ich mich an deinem Schrecken laben!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00108="An meinem Schrecken laben"? ... Angst und Schrecken kann man nicht essen. Das sind nämlich Gefühle ...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00109=Mmhmm! Er recht hat. Nix schmecken Angst.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00110=Ah, der Stinker hat's verstanden.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00111=<Frustriertes Brüllen> Genug!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00112=Moment mal. Bin ich nicht eben gestorben?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00113=Keine Sorge, im Nexus ist der Tod lediglich ein Rückschlag. Nach einer kurzen Pause werdet Ihr kampfbereit wiederbelebt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00114=Habt ihr etwas dagegen, wenn ich mich Euch anschließe? Gemeinsam sind wir stärker.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00115=Überhaupt nicht ... Auf geht's, Partner!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00116=Sitzt auf, dann stürzen wir uns ins Kampfgetümmel.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00117=Wenn Ihr aufsitzt, kommen wir viel schneller wieder zur Front.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00118=Ihr könnt absitzen, indem Ihr erneut die "Aufsitzen"-Taste drückt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00119=Seid vorsichtig. Ich werde nicht immer zur Stelle sein können.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00120=Vorsicht, Junge. Ich habe Euch erneut gerettet.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00121=Sammelt Kugeln ein, um Lebenspunkte und Mana zu regenerieren.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00122=Türme sind tödlich, doch sie schießen immer zuerst auf Diener, bevor sie zu Helden übergehen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00123=Greift einen Turm nur dann an, wenn unsere Diener in der Nähe sind.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00124=Flieht rasch! Wir kommen wieder, wenn wir Diener haben, die uns beschützen!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00125=Bleibt hinter unseren Dienern und lasst sie den Schaden absorbieren.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00126=Vergesst nicht, "Durchschlagsmunition" und "Mut machen" einzusetzen, um Eure Gegner effektiver zu bekämpfen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00127=Wenn Ihr einen wichtigen Befehl vergesst, könnt Ihr ihn links oben sehen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00128=Sehr gut! Bleibt nur noch die gegnerische Zitadelle!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00129=Hast du sonst noch was zu sagen, Feuermaul?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00130=(Brüllt) Ich werde meine Rache bekommen, James Raynor. Wir sind noch nicht fertig!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00131=Na, das ist aber nicht fair!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00132=Wir stehen Euch zur Seite!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00133=Wow, was hat der Nexus denn da angespült ... Schön dich hier zu sehen, Cowboy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00134=Nova? So langsam fühle ich mich hier fast wie zu Hause.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00135=Mach es dir nicht zu bequem ... Das wird noch ganz schön ungemütlich.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00136=Hehe, so mag ich es am liebsten ...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00137=Dann mal los, mein Roter. Ich bin bereit für die zweite Runde.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00138=<Roar>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00139=Ich hoffe, Ihr seid bereit, Raynor. Jetzt wird es ernst!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00140=Ich wurde schon bereit geboren, Uther ...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00141=Wenn Ihr verletzt seid, kehrt zu unserer Halle der Stürme zurück. Dort werden Eure Wunden mit der Zeit automatisch geheilt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00142=Wie zuvor geht es darum, die gegnerische Zitadelle zu zerstören.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00143=Also, ich seh das so: Drei Wege führen zur anderen Basis. Besser, wir sorgen dafür, dass alle Wege abgedeckt sind.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00144=Jetzt habt Ihr es begriffen, Junge. Folgt mir in die Schlacht und macht Euch kampfbereit.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00145=Wenn Ihr gegnerische Diener, Helden oder Gebäude vernichtet, erhält unser Team Erfahrung.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00146=Wir erhalten zusammen Erfahrung und alles, was Ihr tut, trägt zum Erfolg unseres Teams bei.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00147=Hier werden Stufe und Erfahrung beider Teams angezeigt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00148=Sobald die blaue Leiste voll ist, steigt unser Team auf und wir werden alle stärker.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00149=Dann wollen wir uns mal eine Stufe holen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00150=Sehr gut, wir sind eine Stufe aufgestiegen!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00151=Eure Werte haben sich erhöht und Eure Fähigkeiten sind stärker geworden.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00152=Das klingt echt hilfreich. Hast du noch mehr lustige Tricks für mich?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00153=Stufenaufstiege schalten außerdem Talente frei, mit denen Ihr Eure Fähigkeiten Eurem Stil anpassen könnt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00154=Hey, nicht schlecht! Ich fühl' mich schon stärker.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00155=Ihr habt Eure heroische Fähigkeit freigeschaltet. Eine mächtige Fähigkeit, die in der Schlacht die Wende bringt. Passt nur auf, WANN ihr sie einsetzt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00156=Heroisch, ja? Ich freu mich schon, die auszuprobieren.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00157=Verdammt. Ich fühl' mich nicht so gut.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00158=Sucht einen Heilbrunnen auf. Ihr könnt dort per Rechtsklick Lebenspunkte wiederherstellen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00159=Sucht einen Heilbrunnen auf. Ihr könnt dort per Linkssklick Lebenspunkte wiederherstellen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00160=Sucht einen Heilbrunnen auf. Klickt ihn an, um Lebenspunkte wiederherzustellen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00161=Wunderbar. Durch das Trinken am Brunnen regeneriert sich Euer Leben und Mana mit der Zeit.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00162=Doch Ihr müsst warten, bis er wieder aufgefüllt ist, bevor Ihr erneut davon trinken könnt.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00163=Raynor, zieht Euch zurück!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00164=Ich muss mich zurückziehen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00165=Raynor, wir könnten hier Eure Hilfe gebrauchen. Wir werden diese Riesen "überreden", sich uns anzuschließen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00166=Überreden?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00167=Oh, es macht mehr Spaß, als man denkt. Vertrau mir einfach ... <Nachladegeräusch>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00168=Stellt Euch doch einen Augenblick lang in das Signal, ja?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00169=Wunderbar. Sobald ein Söldnerlager besiegt wurde, werden sie sich uns anschließen und entlang des nächstgelegenen Weges angreifen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00170=Alles klar, dann eskortieren wir diese Riesenviecher mal zum Fort und jagen das Ding in die Luft.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00171=Riesen sind sehr gut darin, Forts aus der Entfernung zu zerstören.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00172=Raynor, wir könnten Unterstützung gebrauchen. Versucht, allein ein Söldnerlager einzunehmen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00173=Vergesst nicht, Eure Fähigkeiten einzusetzen, um sie zu besiegen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00175=Raynor, begebt Euch zum Beobachtungspunkt. Wenn Ihr ihn sichern könnt, gewährt er uns Sicht in diesem Bereich.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00176=Bleibt ein Weilchen dort, dann wird der Beobachtungspunkt aktiviert.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00177=Zieht Euch zurück, Junge. Es ist gefährlich, einen Turm ohne unsere Diener anzugreifen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00178=Seid vorsichtig, es sind keine Diener da, die Euch vor dem Turm beschützen könnten.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00179=Beeilung, Junge. Wir brauchen Eure Hilfe gegen diese Riesen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00180=Besser, ich helfe Uther mal, bevor der Alte noch stinkiger wird.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00181=Raynor, ich könnte auf diesem Weg Eure Hilfe gebrauchen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00182=Nicht vergessen, Jimmy: diese Fähigkeiten öfter einsetzen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00183=Ihr habt nur noch wenige Lebenspunkte. Sucht Euch einen Heilbrunnen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00184=Euer Mana ist am Ende. Trinkt von einem Heilbrunnen oder teleportiert Euch mit dem Ruhestein in die Basis, um Mana und Leben zu regenerieren.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00185=Jetzt sollten wir vielleicht ein Söldnerlager einnehmen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00186=Kaum noch Leben und der Brunnen ist leer. Ich nehm besser den Ruhestein und heile mich in der Basis.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00187=Sitzt auf, dann kommt Ihr schneller wieder an die Front.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00188=Mit einem Reittier könnt Ihr Euch viel schneller bewegen. Die Standardtaste dafür ist: Y
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00189=Keine Zeit zum Rumsitzen, Marshal. Such dir einen Weg und mach dich kampfbereit.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00190=Klasse, eine Regenerationskugel. Genau das hab ich gebraucht.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00191=Vergesst nicht, ein Talent zu wählen, Junge.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00192=Der Gegner hat unseren Beobachtungspunkt eingenommen. Wir sollten ihn uns zurückholen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00193=Mit Durchschlagsmunition könnte ich diese Gruppe von Gegnern schnell ausschalten.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00194=Raynor! Nutzt Eure Fähigkeit "Mut machen", um unsere Angriffe zu verstärken.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00195=Ein Rechtsklick bricht eine Fähigkeit ab. Nutze den Linksklick, um eine Fähigkeit einzusetzen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00197=Ihr habt die Fähigkeit abgebrochen. Passt auf, dass Ihr die richtige Maustaste drückt, um Eure Durchschlagsmunition abzufeuern.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00198=Rechtsklicken bricht eine Fähigkeit ab. Nutzt den Linksklick, um die Hyperion zu rufen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00200=Ihr habt die Fähigkeit abgebrochen. Passt auf, dass Ihr die richtige Maustaste drückt, um die Hyperion zu rufen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00201=Wenn Ihr nur noch wenige Lebenspunkte habt, trinkt von einem Heilbrunnen oder kehrt mittels Ruhestein in die Basis zurück.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00202=Werdet nicht übermütig. Wenn Ihr Euch mit wenigen Lebenspunkten in den Kampf stürzt, bringt das unseren Gegnern Erfahrung und uns fehlt ein Mann.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00203=Setzt Euren Ruhestein ein, um zur Zitadelle zurückzukehren. Achtet aber darauf, dass Ihr dabei weit vom Gegner entfernt oder gut verborgen seid.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00204=Hey! Du hast meinen Ruhestein unterbrochen!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00205=Die Verwendung eines Ruhesteins dauert einige Zeit und kann durch Angriffe unterbrochen werden. Nutzt ihn nur an einem sicheren Ort.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00206=Ich würde sagen, das sieht wie der perfekte Zeitpunkt aus, um die Hyperion anzufordern.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00207=Ich wette, wenn ich jetzt die Hyperion anfordere, können wir die Kerle alle ausschalten.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00208=Na, was sollst du denn für einer sein? Eine Art Ritter?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00209=Ein Paladin, um genau zu sein.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00210=Das ist doch nur Haarspalterei, oder?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00211=Nein, eigentlich nutzt ein Paladin die Macht des...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00212=Halt die Luft an, Kumpel. Ich muss das nicht wirklich wissen ...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00213=Wie ich mich freue, dich zu sehen, Nova.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00214=Ich wünschte, ich könnte dasselbe über dich sagen, Cowboy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00215=Hey, Diablo ... <Schmatzen> Ich glaube, ich kann DEINE Furcht schmecken ...

Conversation/Spooky18/Line00001=Generäle, geht hinaus und metzelt in meinem Namen. Der Rabenfürst gebietet es.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00002=Königszier wird fallen. Lasst dies allen eine Warnung sein, die sich dem Rabenfürsten widersetzen.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00003=Die volle Macht des Rabenfürsten wird über dieses jämmerliche Königreich herfallen.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00004=Gespensterritter Zarya, läutert dieses Reich mit unheiligen Flammen.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00005=Ihr glaubt, Ihr könnt meinen Generälen die Stirn bieten? Ich bitte Euch. <lacht>
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00006=Wer wagt es, meinen Gespensterritter zu erschlagen? Oh, Ihr seid es. Ich hätte es wissen müssen. 
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00007=Sieh einer an, einer meiner Generäle ist gefallen. Was für lästiges Ungeziefer Ihr doch seid.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00008=Der Spektralwyrm Alexstrasza, Aspekt des Untodes, steht Euch gegenüber.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00009=Aspekt des Untodes, der Rabenfürst ruft Euch in seinen Dienst!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00010=<Ausruf der Verärgerung> Wie konntet Ihr etwas töten, das nicht richtig lebt?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00011=Der Spektralwyrm ist gefallen? <spöttisch> Das hier ist noch längst nicht vorbei.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00012=Höhlenhexe, die Zeit ist gekommen, dieses Reich zu strafen!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00013=Königszier wird für seine Einmischung bestraft werden.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00014=Ich verfluche Euch, Eindringlinge.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00015=Warum wollt Ihr einfach nicht sterben?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00016=Spinnenwächterin, ich habe frische Beute für Euch gefunden.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00017=Macht meine Feinde ausfindig, General. Und zeigt keine Gnade.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00018=Die Jagd ist vorbei, der Krieg aber noch nicht.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00019=So ... Ihr habt also Euren Verfolger getötet ... <seufzt> Ich werde Eurer Mätzchen langsam überdrüssig.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00020=Habt Ihr etwa angenommen, dass Ihr mir so einfach davonkommt?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00021=So, Ihr habt also meine Generäle besiegt. Nun denn. Lasst uns sehen, wie Ihr mit dem Drachenritter zurechtkommt.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00022=Genießt Euren kümmerlichen Sieg, Helden. Denn Königszier ist nicht mehr.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00023=Ihr habt gesiegt, Helden. Ihr seid die großen Champions eines sterbenden Reiches. <lacht>
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00024=Ihr haltet Euch für unheimlich schlau, nicht wahr?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00025=Ein Relikt aus der Vergangenheit ...
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00026=Hmpf. Vergnügt Euch ruhig mit diesem wertlosen Relikt.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00027=Ihr verschwendet Eure Kraft.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00031=Ich habe genug von diesen Scherereien.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00032=Wie könnt Ihr es wagen, dem Rabenfürsten zu trotzen.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00033=Nein …
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00034=Ihr steht nicht mehr in meiner Gunst, <beat> um es gelinde auszudrücken.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00035=Ihr habt meine Streitkräfte geschwächt, das ist wahr. Aber keine Macht kann meinen Zorn jetzt noch zügeln.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00036=Königszier wird heute Nacht fallen. So will es der Rabenfürst!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00037=Helden, zu den Waffen! Vernichtet die Diener des Rabenfürsten!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00038=Heute werden wir dem Rabenfürsten eine Niederlage beibringen. Königszier wird obsiegen!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00039=Die Übeltaten des Rabenfürsten enden hier. Ich werde sein Handeln nicht länger tolerieren!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00040=Der Gespensterritter des Rabenfürsten trachtet danach, mein Reich zu brandschatzen. Erstickt sein unheiliges Feuer.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00041=Diese leere Ritterrüstung ist ein General des Rabenfürsten. Und genauso wie ihr Meister, wird auch sie fallen.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00042=Kein Gespenst kann gegen einen wahren Ritter von Königszier bestehen.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00043=Nur keine Angst, Rabenfürst. Ihr werdet Eurem Gespensterritter schon bald folgen.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00044=Der Rabenfürst wagt es, Königszier mit einem Drachen anzugreifen? Welch ein Narr.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00045=Einst war der Spektralwyrm eine edle Kreatur. Doch nun dient sie einem üblen Meister. Gebt ihrem Geist die Freiheit wieder.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00046=Möge die Drachenseele erneut frei sein.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00047=Königszier ist ein Reich voller Leben. Der Untod hat hier keinen Platz.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00048=Dies ist erst vorbei, wenn Ihr besiegt vor mir im Staub liegt, Rabenfürst.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00049=Die Höhlenhexe ging einen dunklen Handel ein, um an ihre Macht zu gelangen. Doch mit unserem Stahl kann sie sich nicht messen.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00050=Diese Hexe möchte uns "bestrafen". Zeigt ihr, was dieses Wort wirklich bedeutet.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00051=Ihre widerliche Magie wird mein Reich nicht länger entweihen.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00052=Der Fluch ist dahin, Rabenfürst. Und Eure Hexe ebenso.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00053=Der Rabenfürst hat seine Spinnenwächterin ausgesandt, um uns aufzulauern. Doch wir sind keine leichte Beute.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00054=Bald wird die Jägerin merken, dass sie in Wahrheit die Gejagte ist.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00055=Hmpf. Zerquetscht wie eine gewöhnliche Spinne.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00056=Spinnt Eure Netze, Rabenfürst. Ich werde sie alle durchschneiden.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00057=Der Drachenritter wurde verderbt?! Für diese Untat werdet Ihr büßen, Rabenfürst!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00058=Nein ... mein geliebter Gemahl ... Das ist unverzeihlich! Helden, tut, was Ihr tun müsst!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00059=War dies alles ... umsonst ...?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00060=Auch wenn der Fluch mich dahinrafft, Königszier ... wird überleben ...
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00061=Königszier wird gegen den Dunklen Nexus triumphieren!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00062=Es war ein großer Fehler, in mein Reich einzudringen, Rabenfürst.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00063=Eure Taten werden bis in alle Ewigkeit unvergessen bleiben, Helden.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00064=Unsere edlen Streitkräfte können von solchen Monstrositäten nicht besiegt werden!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00065=Ich kenne mich mit Schmerz und Verlust aus. Wir werden dafür sorgen, dass der Rabenfürst mit beidem Bekanntschaft macht.

Conversation/Toy18/Line00001=Hey, ein neuer Freund! Cool! Wollen wir zusammen spielen? Ich habe ein Spiel selber gemacht. Das macht voll Spaß.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00002=Also, das hier ist das Spielbrett und das da bist du ... und ... und ... wir ham Würfel ... und so Karten ... und Sticker ... Und, ha, ich freu mich voll.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00003=Das Ziel ist, man muss hier rum und Quests machen. Dafür kriegt man Preise. Fang mal an zu würfeln!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00004=Ui, toll gewürfelt. Wenn du auf so einem Feld landest, dann machst du einfach, was auf der Questkarte steht.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00005=Wenn du auf so einem Feld landest, dann machst du einfach, was auf der Questkarte steht. Okay?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00006=Du hast 'ne Quest fertig. Dann kriegst du jetzt einen Sticker. Für drei Sticker kriegst du eine Kiste voll mit Überraschungen. Nich' mal ich weiß, was da drin ist.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00007=Die Quest hier ist für Mephisto. Oder nein, die ist für Kleiner. <seufzt> Wie jetzt? Müssen wir den auch noch zusammenflicken? Ein bisschen komisch, oder? Na ja, leg mal los!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00008=Mit dem kleinen Bär'n hab ich schon immer gern gespielt. Aber, ähm, hast du vielleicht meinen Mephisto irgendwo gesehen?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00009=Oh-oh. <seufzt> Jemand ist auf mein ... Ich meine, der Einhornstall ist irgendwie kaputt gegangen. Hier ist eine Quest, wo du Zeugs sammeln musst, um 'nen neuen zu bauen.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00010=Quest fertig. Hier ist deine Belohnung. Gib mir die Sachen zum Bauen! Toll und jetzt ... hast du meinen Kleber irgendwo gesehen?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00011=Oh, eine Spezialquest. Mein Dehaka hat sich ... also der is' verletzt und, äh, du musst jetzt Teile von den andern Spielsachen sammeln, damit du ihn wieder heil machst. Glaub ich.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00012=Oh, du hast's geschafft?! Er ist wieder ganz. Hammer! Äh, ich meine, äh, das hast du voll gut gemacht mit der Quest. Hier, bitte, für dich.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00013=Och nee, beim Löwen ist wieder der Akku alle. Ich weiß gar nicht, wie man das auflädt. Können wir ihm einfach Diener zu fressen geben oder so? Das muss doch gehen! Hilfst du mir, das rauszufinden?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00014=Gibt's doch gar nicht. Das hat funktioniert? Öhm, ich meine, natürlich hat das funktioniert. Hab ich ja gesagt. Wir sind eben einfach die Besten.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00015=Okay, also ... Ich hab die Waffen von der Valeera von meiner Schwester kaputt gemacht ... Das war keine Absicht. Du musst das bitte für mich reparatieren, sonst krieg ich bestimmt Ärger. Also, hier, 'ne neue Quest. Bitte beeil dich!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00016=Du hast's geschafft. Oh, danke! Dafür helf ich dir auch mal. <seufzt> Das is' grad ist noch mal gutgegangen. Hier, für dich.

Conversation/Toy18/Line00018=Hast du das Spiel schon wieder gewonnen? Das gibt's doch gar nicht. Das macht dir also wirklich Spaß!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00019=Öhm, spielst du immer noch? Du kannst aber nicht die ganze Nacht dableiben. Mama sagt, ich muss noch aufräumen.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00020=Gut gemacht! Hier ist 'ne Überraschungskiste. Ich hoffe, du kriegst was Tolles!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00021=So langsam glaub ich, das Spiel ist zu einfach. Vielleicht sollte ich alles irgendwie hundertzwölfundfünfzig Mal schwerer machen.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00022=Noch mal gewonnen? Hier ist dein Preis.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00023=Wenn du so weiter machst, hab ich bald keine Preise mehr. Das hab ich wohl irgendwie nicht gut geplant. Hmpf.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00024=Du, schon wieder? <seufzt> Okay, öhm ... Die Preise sind da drüben ... irgendwo.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00025=Wahnsinn, Held! Du hast das Spiel gewonnen! Moment, du bist das ja schon wieder. Ich dachte, es wäre mal wer anders. Aber, äh, gut gemacht! Haha.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00026=Gut gemacht! Das feiern wir!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00027=Mann, bist du gut! Vielleicht sogar zu gut.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00028=He, das darfst du nicht! Das ist mein Spiel und ich mach die Regeln! Und die Regel heißt, du darfst das nicht.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00029=Das ist nicht fair! Du mogelst!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00030=Was? Das steht nicht in den Regeln ... und wenn doch, dann tu ich das da rausstreichen!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00031=Hey, lass das! Nein!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00032=Wenn du das noch mal machst, nehm ich dir meine Spielsachen weg.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00033=Boah, ich wusste gar nicht, dass das geht. Das war irre!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00034=Wie hast du das denn gemacht? Mach das noch mal!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00035=Der Hammer!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00036=Wow, du bist ja noch viel-viel besserer als die anderen.

VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Death00=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Death01=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Death02=<Death Exertion>

VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Healed02=Gut.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroAgree00=Ich stimme zu.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroAgree01=Ich freue mich bereits.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroAgree02=Ich werde ihnen das Fleisch von den Knochen reißen.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroBoast00=Wir werden im Blut unserer Feinde baden!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroBoast01=Auf unsere Feinde warten ewige Qualen!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroQuestion00=Seid Ihr gewappnet?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroQuestion01=Seid Ihr bereit, Euren Zorn brodeln zu lassen?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Seid gegrüßt, Lichkönig!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Dies ist kein geeigneter Ort für deine lachhafte Spezies, Murloc ...
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Ihr ...
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Anscheinend hat uns das Schicksal zusammengeführt ...
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroQuestion_Zagara00=Schöne Beine.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroRespond00=<lacht> Natürlich.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroRespond01=Immer.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroRespond02=Da fragt Ihr noch?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Solange Ihr herrscht, werde ich gehorchen.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Wie bitte?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Auf Euch kann ich keine Zeit verschwenden.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Schlachten wir sie ab im Namen des Meisters.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/IntroResponse_Zagara00=Mein Wille ist bereits Untertan eines Monarchen, da ist kein Platz für einen weiteren.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Kill00=F-lakkh shir!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Kill01=Eure Seele wird den Schwarm nähren.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Kill02=Hört Ihr die Stimme des Meisters?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Kill03=Dem Netz des Todes entkommt niemand!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Kill04=Ihr habt versagt.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillAbathur00=Würmer wie Euch esse ich zum Frühstück.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillArthas00=Endlich bin ich frei von Eurem Joch!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillLeoric00=Eure Macht ist nichts im Vergleich zu der meines Meisters!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillSiegeTank00=Eure Maschinen können der Geißel nichts anhaben.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Erblasst im Angesicht meiner Macht!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/KillSylvanas00=Im Tod werdet Ihr keinen Frieden finden, Verräterin.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Laugh00=<kichert>
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ich danke Euch für die Heilung.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ich kämpfe weiter.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowLifeHeal02=Heilung genau zur richtigen Zeit.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowMana00=Ich habe nur noch wenig Mana.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowMana01=Mana geht zur Neige.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/LowMana02=Ich brauche mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/No00=Dem kann ich nicht Folge leisten.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/No01=Ihr verlangt das Unmögliche.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/No02=Nein.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Steht unserem Verbündeten bei!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich brauche Hilfe!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Schnell, zu mir!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zerstört die feindliche Zitadelle.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Lasst uns diese Söldner unterwerfen.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Greifen wir dieses Fort an.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Dieser Beobachtungspunkt soll uns gehören.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Unsere Zitadelle darf nicht fallen!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verteidigt dieses Fort!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt verteidigen.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ping_KillHero00=Dieser Held muss sterben.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed00=Sprecht.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed01=Die Zeit fliegt dahin.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed02=Die Fäden des Schicksals weben nur ein Netz des Todes.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed03=Ich bin der oberste Gruftlord und ein Diener des Lichkönigs. Ich muss mir das nicht gefallen lassen.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed04=Wenn Ihr seht, wie sich der Boden unter Euch bewegt, ist es bereits zu spät.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed05=Weg mit dem Insektengift!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed06=Ugh ... Hat sich jemand den Namen dieser Gilde notiert? Irgendwas mit Paragon, oder?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed07=Ihr glaubt, ich sei stämmig? Dann solltet Ihr mal meine Stiefmutter sehen.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed08=Ist Euch schon einmal aufgefallen, dass man immer genau dann unliebsamen Besuch von Helden bekommt, wenn man gerade die lila Gegenstände sortiert hat?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed09=Die Prüfung des Kreuzfahrers war lediglich ein kleiner Rückschlag.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed10=Es gibt ein Sprichwort in Azjol-Nerub: Im Königreich der Spinnen ist der riesige, allesfressende Käfer König.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed11=Die Fehde zwischen den Gruftlords und den Schreckenslords währt ewig.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed12=Nein, ich bin ganz bestimmt kein Auto.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed13=Sei kein Noob, das Recht ist mir vorbehalten. <SFX: cricket chirp> Das Geräusch mache ich selbst.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed14=Macht das noch 10 Minuten und ich werde richtig wütend.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Resurrected00=Genau zum richtigen Zeitpunkt.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Resurrected01=Ich kehre zurück!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Revive00=Mein Dienst ist für die Ewigkeit.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Revive01=Ich bin zurückgekehrt!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Revive02=Ich komme aus den Tiefen.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Spec00=Das wird ausreichen.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Spec01=Macht erfüllt mich.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Spec02=<evil cackle>
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Spec03=In der Tat.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Spec04=Meine Dienste werden belohnt.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Taunt00=Dieses Schlachtfeld wird Euch als Grab dienen!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Taunt01=Schmerz und Pein erwarten Euch!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Taunt02=Nichts kommt meiner Macht gleich!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/TeamKilled00=Sie werden unserer Rache schutzlos ausgeliefert sein.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_ExLocked00=Ich sehne mich nach dem Kampf!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ich werde Euch ewig dienen.

VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_Lockin00=Für den Frostthron!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_Purchase00=Ich werde Euch bis über den Tod hinaus dienen.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_Trial00=Kommt und seht die Macht der Gruftlords!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_Trial01=Grausige Pein all jenen, die mich herausfordern!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Befreit mich und Eure Gegner werden die meinen sein.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Vielleicht sollte ich Euch mein Können demonstrieren?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=<angespannt, frustriert> Gilt es nicht, eine Schlacht zu führen?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Der Lichkönig war nichts als eine im Eis festgefrorene Rüstung und dennoch ein aktiverer Anführer als Ihr.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ultimate1Used00=Erstickt in meinem Netz.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ultimate1Used01=Ihr gehört mir!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ultimate2Used00=Spürt den Zorn des Schwarms!

VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/WorthIt01=Der Tod führt uns zum Sieg.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Yes00=Bei Nerub.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Yes01=Zweifellos.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Yes02=Ich kümmere mich darum.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Yes03=Pervers.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Yes04=Tod den Lebenden.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Yes05=Die Zeit ist gekommen.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Yes06=So soll es sein.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Yes07=Für den Frostthron!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Yes08=Wie Ihr befehlt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Attack00=Wir müssen vorrücken!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Attack01=Geht zum Angriff über!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Attack02=Unsere Zeit zum Angreifen ist gekommen!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Caution00=Etwas stimmt hier nicht. Seid auf der Hut.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_GoodJob00=Ein gewagtes Manöver.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_GoodJob01=Tapferkeit steht Euch gut.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_GoodJob02=Ihr besitzt die Seele eines Kriegers.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Heal00=Eure Wunden sind tief. Heilt Euch!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Heal01=Ich nehme an, Ihr seid auf dem Weg zu einem Heilbrunnen?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Retreat00=Wir müssen uns zurückziehen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Retreat01=Zieht Euch zurück, Krieger!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Uhoh00=Bedauerlich.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Uhoh01=Das war nicht vorherbestimmt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Uhoh02=Ich trauere um Euch, mein Freund.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack00=Vernichten!

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack05=Wir stehen gegen das Dunkel!

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroAgree00=So soll es sein.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroAgree01=In Euren Worten liegt Wahrheit.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroAgree02=Für den Ruhm der Daelaam!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroBoast00=Unser Glaube wird uns den Sieg bringen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroBoast01=Der Feind hat unserer Macht nichts entgegenzusetzen.

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Fenix00=Fenix!

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond00=Die Wege des Krieges sind mir nicht unbekannt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond01=Unsere Feinde werden diesen Tag bereuen!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond02=Wir bleiben tapfer im Angesicht der Gefahr.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=Auch nicht anders als Ihr, Alarak.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Wenn Euch auch nur ein Funken Weisheit innewohnt, schweigt Ihr besser.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Fenix00=Wir werden Ihnen die Macht der Templer zeigen!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Das werde ich keiner Antwort würdigen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Ich benötige die Khala nicht, um zu wissen, was Ihr davon haltet.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Der Feind wird unter unserem Angriff zerbrechen!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Raynor00=Der Nexus hat mich entführt und eine Schlacht steht uns bevor ... doch ich kann nicht klagen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Tassadar00=Zum Ruhme Aiurs!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Zeratul00=Anon por-ghal!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Wir werden unsere Rechnung nach der Schlacht begleichen, Monster.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill00=Ihr entbehrt jeglicher Ehre.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill01=Enttäuschend.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill02=Den Klingen eines Templers nicht gewachsen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill03=Nur gemeinsam ist man stark.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill04=Eine niedere Lebensform.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillAlarak00=Das ... fühlt sich überraschend gut an.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillKerrigan00=Das war für Raszagal!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillProtoss00=Ihr hättet Euch unserer Einheit nicht verwehren sollen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillRaynor00=Es betrübt mich zutiefst, Freund Raynor.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Genug!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillTassadar00=Es scheint, als habe der Schüler den Meister überholt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillZeratul00=Möge Adun Euch das nächste Mal verbergen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillZerg00=Ich werde die Galaxie von Euresgleichen befreien.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Laugh00=<bemused laugh>
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal00=Genau wie der Astralwind ...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal01=Eure Güte wird nicht vergessen werden.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal02=Eure Unterstützung ist ein entscheidender Faktor.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana00=Es fehlt mir an Mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana01=Mein Mana ist kritisch.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana02=Ich benötige mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No00=Nein.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No01=Das ist nicht vorherbestimmt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No02=Unmöglich.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter benötigt Beistand.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Steht mir bei!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Der Feind bedroht mich.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Vernichtet die Zitadelle des Gegners!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Lasst uns dieses Söldnerlager erobern.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Macht dieses Fort dem Erdboden gleich!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Wir müssen diesen Beobachtungspunkt sichern.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt die Zitadelle, bevor sie fällt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verstärkt die Verteidigung unseres Forts.

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed00=Die Dämmerung naht.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed01=Stärke durch Einheit.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed02=Diese Welt wirft viele Fragen auf und beantwortet nur wenige ...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed03=Waren die Xel'Naga an der Entstehung des Nexus beteiligt? Falls ja, dann haben sie keine Tempel zurückgelassen ... kein neues Leben ...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed04=Es sei denn, diese Lebewesen entziehen sich unserem Blick ... und kontrollieren uns durch eine Art digitalen Mechanismus ... wie ein virtuelles Schlachtfeld.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed05=Vielleicht gibt es sogar Tausende dieser Lebewesen, die alle gleichzeitig unsere Leben manipulieren. Hach ... Genug, ich bekomme Kopfschmerzen davon.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed06=Ich frage mich, was die Daelaam in meiner Abwesenheit tun. Hoffentlich haben sie die Möbel in meiner Ratskammer nicht umgestellt. Ich hasse es, wenn sie das tun.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed07=Die Speer des Adun schwebt also direkt über mir ... und doch gibt es keine Spur von Phasenschmied Karax? <seufzt> Das sieht ihm ähnlich.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed08=Hört Ihr jetzt endlich auf, mich anzustupsen? Lebt Eure Aggressionen doch an einem dieser Orcs aus und findet heraus, ob die sich das gefallen lassen!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed09=Übrigens, als ich sagte, StarCraft sei kein Warcraft im Weltraum, da war von Heroes of the Storm noch gar keine Rede.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed10=Ja, mein Raumschiff folgt mir auf Schritt und Tritt. Man könnte es mit dem vergleichen, was die Terraner "Haustiere" nennen ... nur in nützlich.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed11=Ahh ... <liest>Artanis, Hierarsch der Daelaam.</liest> Was zum? Hier-Arsch? Wo kommt denn das S ...? <wütend/laut>Zmydlorg! Jetzt habe ich zehntausend Visitenkarten mit Schreibfehler drucken lassen!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed12=Was haltet Ihr von meiner neuen Rüstung? Meine alte war doch sehr ... luftig.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed13=Jung bin ich eigentlich nur für einen Protoss. Ich lebe bereits zwei Jahrhunderte länger als die meisten von Euch. Also bitte, zeigt ein wenig Respekt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed14=Habt Ihr meinen Namen schon einmal rückwärts ausgesprochen? Klingt wie Musik in meinen Ohren.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected00=Mir wurde eine zweite Chance gewährt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected01=Mein Dank ist Euch gewiss.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive00=Wir müssen vereint kämpfen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive01=Ich darf nicht versagen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec00=Ein weiser Entschluss.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec01=Faszinierend.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec02=Ah, ich erkenne Euren Plan.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec03=Höchst strategisch.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec04=Das wird mir dienlich sein.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt00=Ihr benehmt Euch wie ein Mitglied einer ... rückständigen Zivilisation.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt01=Wenn Euch Eure eigene Dummheit nicht umbringt, dann meine Klingen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt02=Meditation stärkt Körper und Geist. Ihr habt das wohl noch nie versucht.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/TeamKilled00=Auf die Dunkelheit folgt das Licht.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExLocked00=Wir müssen zusammenstehen, wenn wir siegen wollen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Harak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Gift00=Ich biete meine Hilfe großzügig an.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Lockin00=Der Ruhm ruft uns.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Purchase00=Wir kämpfen vereint!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial00=Ein Templer muss stets seine Fertigkeiten verbessern.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial01=Ich freue mich auf eine Herausforderung.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Wir müssen unsere Taten in diesem Reich sorgsam überdenken.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Ich sehe, Ihr handelt nicht überstürzt. Das bewundere ich.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Die Zeit des Nachdenkens ist vorbei.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Es gibt Schlachten zu schlagen. Wir dürfen nicht zögern!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used00=Speer des Adun, Feuer!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used01=Aktiviert den Destruktorstrahl!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used02=Beginnt mit der Säuberung.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate2Used00=Nehmt ihnen die Sicht!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate2Used01=Werdet Zeugen der Macht der Arche!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate2Used02=Eure Sicht schwindet!

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed01=Stärke durch Einheit.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed02=Diese Welt wirft viele Fragen auf und beantwortet nur wenige ...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed03=Waren die Xel'Naga an der Entstehung des Nexus beteiligt? Falls ja, dann haben sie keine Tempel zurückgelassen ... kein neues Leben ...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed04=Es sei denn, diese Lebewesen entziehen sich unserem Blick ... und kontrollieren uns durch eine Art digitalen Mechanismus ... wie ein virtuelles Schlachtfeld.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed05=Vielleicht gibt es sogar Tausende dieser Lebewesen, die alle gleichzeitig unsere Leben manipulieren. Hach ... Genug, ich bekomme Kopfschmerzen davon.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed06=Ich frage mich, was die Daelaam in meiner Abwesenheit tun. Hoffentlich haben sie die Möbel in meiner Ratskammer nicht umgestellt. Ich hasse es, wenn sie das tun.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed07=Die Speer des Adun schwebt also direkt über mir ... und doch gibt es keine Spur von Phasenschmied Karax? <seufzt> Das sieht ihm ähnlich. Wenigstes bettelt er nicht wieder um Solarit ...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed08=Die Speer des Adun schwebt also direkt über mir ... und doch gibt es keine Spur von Phasenschmied Karax? <seufzt> Das sieht ihm ähnlich.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed09=Hört Ihr jetzt endlich auf, mich anzustupsen? Lebt Eure Aggressionen doch an einem dieser Orcs aus und findet heraus, ob die sich das gefallen lassen!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed10=Übrigens, als ich sagte, StarCraft sei kein Warcraft im Weltraum, da war von Heroes of the Storm noch gar keine Rede.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed11=Ja, mein Raumschiff folgt mir auf Schritt und Tritt. Man könnte es mit dem vergleichen, was die Terraner "Haustiere" nennen ... nur in nützlich.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed12=Ahh ... <liest>Artanis, Hierarsch der Daelaam.</liest> Was zum? Hier-Arsch? Wo kommt denn das S ...? <wütend/laut>Zmydlorg! Jetzt habe ich zehntausend Visitenkarten mit Schreibfehler drucken lassen! 
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed13=Was haltet Ihr von meiner neuen Rüstung? Meine alte war doch sehr ... luftig.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed14=Jung bin ich eigentlich nur für einen Protoss. Ich lebe bereits zwei Jahrhunderte länger als die meisten von Euch. Also bitte, zeigt ein wenig Respekt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed15=Habt Ihr meinen Namen schon einmal rückwärts ausgesprochen? Klingt wie Musik in meinen Ohren.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected00=Mir wurde eine zweite Chance gewährt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected01=Mein Dank ist Euch gewiss.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Revive00=Wir müssen vereint kämpfen.

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec03=Höchst strategisch.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec04=Das wird mir dienlich sein.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt00=Ihr benehmt Euch wie ein Mitglied einer ... rückständigen Zivilisation.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt01=Wenn Euch Eure eigene Dummheit nicht umbringt, dann meine Klingen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt02=Meditation stärkt Körper und Geist. Ihr habt das wohl noch nie versucht.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/TeamKilled00=Auf die Dunkelheit folgt das Licht.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_ExLocked00=Wir müssen zusammenstehen, wenn wir siegen wollen.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_ExPurchased00=Harak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Gift00=Ich biete meine Hilfe großzügig an.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Lockin00=Der Ruhm ruft uns.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Purchase00=Wir kämpfen vereint!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial00=Ein Templer muss stets seine Fertigkeiten verbessern.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial01=Ich freue mich auf eine Herausforderung.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked00=Wir müssen unsere Taten in diesem Reich sorgsam überdenken.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked01=Ich sehe, Ihr handelt nicht überstürzt. Das bewundere ich.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased00=Die Zeit des Nachdenkens ist vorbei.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased01=Es gibt Schlachten zu schlagen. Wir dürfen nicht zögern!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used00=Speer des Adun, Feuer!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used01=Aktiviert den Destruktorstrahl!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used02=Beginnt mit der Säuberung.

VoiceOver/Azmodan/Pissed03=I will show you such terrible pleasures, unbearable suffering!
VoiceOver/Azmodan/Pissed04=Depravity is a matter of perspective.
VoiceOver/Azmodan/Pissed05=Those who believe there are only seven deadly sins lack imagination.
VoiceOver/Azmodan/Pissed06=The wages of Sin is death. And that is why every pay period the cleanup is such a pain.
VoiceOver/Azmodan/Pissed07=Hmph. These nipple rings are starting to chafe.
VoiceOver/Azmodan/Pissed08=Strange... Idall, the Lord of Sloth, was supposed to meet me here an hour ago... It is so unlike him to be this late.

VoiceOver/Azmodan/Yes04=<threatening growl>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Attack00=Holen wir uns den Sieg!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Attack01=Los, zieht zum Korb!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Attack02=Macht sie platt! Der Sieg gehört uns!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Caution00=Augen auf, Team.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_GoodJob00=Starker Einsatz, Team.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_GoodJob01=Gutes Teamwork.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_GoodJob02=Hm. Nach allen Regeln der Kunst.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Heal00=Heil dich mal. Jeder im Team muss vollen Einsatz bringen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Heal01=Zieh dir was vom Heilbrunnen rein, der ist isotonisch.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Retreat00=Zurück in unsere Hälfte.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Retreat01=Ich brauche eine Auszeit.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Uhoh00=Das war's mit den Playoffs.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Uhoh01=Bind dir erst mal die Schuhe richtig zu.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/AI_Uhoh02=Schiri! Das war ein klares Foul!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack00=Jetzt gibt's Rammelbammel.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack01=Euch zeige ich, was Ballkontrolle ist.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack02=Ich geh in die Offensive!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack03=Gleich kassiert hier wer ein böses Foul ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack04=Lust auf eine geBALLte Ladung Schmerz?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack05=Ich habe den Flow.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack06=Blockt DAS!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Attack07=Damit komme ich in die Bestenliste.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Celebrate00=Das war ein großer Wurf.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Celebrate01=Astrein, Jungs.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Comeback00=Weiter so, Team. Jetzt gehen WIR in Führung.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill01=Booyah!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill02=Der hat gesessen ... <evil laugh>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill03=Ska-doosh.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill04=Alley ups ... du bist tot.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill05=Von der Dreierlinie!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/GlobeKill06=Für drei!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Healed00=Mmm. Besser als drei Tage Eistonne.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Healed01=Gutes Teamwork.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Healed02=Du bist der beste Mannschaftsarzt der Liga.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroAgree00=Diese Dummbeutel werden wir auseinandernehmen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroAgree01=Die werden wir gehörig aufmischen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroAgree02=Ich hole mir den Sprungball.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroBoast00=Diesen Narren werden wir zeigen, wie man spielt!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroBoast01=Jetzt zeigen wir ihnen, wer auf diesem Feld zuhause ist.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion00=Der Sprungball kommt jeden Moment. Seid ihr bereit?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion01=Achtung, gleich wird hier gedunkt, was das Zeug hält.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Angel00=Ich bin mit einem Engel im Team? Du wurdest wohl als Letzter gewählt ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Chen00=Einen interessanten Durstlöscher hast du da ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Wie ich höre, hast du's drauf, Nephalem. Und ich bin immer auf Talentsuche.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Ich hoffe, du hast deine Sprungwürfe trainiert, Fröschlein.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Du? Heutzutage lassen sie aber auch jeden aufs Spielfeld ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Hallo, Partner. Bereit für ein paar Slamdunks?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroQuestion_Prime00=Ein Großes Übel auf dem Spielfeld? Halte dich einfach an mich.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroRespond00=Bitte ... Ich wurde mit einem Basketball in den Klauen geboren.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroRespond01=Narr. Diese Halle gehört mir, vergiss das nicht.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroRespond02=Dann wollen wir mal ein paar Körbe werfen!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Angel00=Hör zu, Engel. Wenn du den Ball erwischst, passt du zu mir. (bedrohlich) Und bedankst dich schön für den Assist.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Angry00=Narr. Diese Halle gehört mir, vergiss das nicht.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Annoyed00=Hältst du mich für einen Bankwärmer? Das wirst du bereuen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Chen00=Und ich bin Azmodunk, Herr des Slams.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Mir jucken schon die Klauen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Wer hat diese Flaschen in MEINE Halle gelassen?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hmm. Reden schwingen kannst du, aber kannst du auch mit den Besten slammen?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Negative00=Wenn's nach mir ginge, würdest du immer noch die Bank wärmen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Positive00=Machen wir sie platt!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Prime00=Zeigen wir ihnen, wie man in den Brennenden Hallen spielt.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill00=Das ist meine Halle.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill01=Boom shakalaka!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill02=Jetzt bist du im Aus.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill03=Du bist mein Spielball.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill04=Ein schönes taktisches Foul.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillButcher00=Zurück in die zweite Liga mit dir.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillD3Hero00=<Scoff> Nephalem bringen's nicht.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillDiablo00=Herr des Schreckens? Das einzige Schreckliche an dir sind deine Moves!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillSpreeEnd00=Du hast das Spiel zu weit getrieben.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillTyrael00=Probier's doch mal mit Baseball, Engel.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillUther00=Vielleicht liegt dir Golf ja besser, alter Mann.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Laugh00=<Quiet evil laughter>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowLifeHeal00=Das war kurz vor der Auslinie.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowLifeHeal01=Das war knapp.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowLifeHeal02=Im letzten Moment.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowMana00=Ich könnte ein wenig Mana gebrauchen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowMana01=Ich brauche Mana.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowMana02=Ich habe kein Mana mehr.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/No00=Ähm, nein.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/No01=Ein schlechter Spielzug.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/No02=Spiel hier nicht den Narren.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AssistHero00=Ein Verbündeter steckt in der Klemme. Helft ihm.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich brauche einen Assist.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AssistMe01=Wir sind ein Team, Leute! Helft mir!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackCastle00=Alle Mann auf ihre Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackMerc00=Holt diese Söldner von der Bank.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Greift dieses Fort an.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackTower00=Holen wir diesen Beobachtungspunkt.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt die Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Sie wollen sich unser Fort holen. Manndeckung!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendTower00=Verteidigt diesen Beobachtungspunkt.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_KillHero00=Diesen Angeber müssen wir ausschalten.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed00=Was geht?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed01=Yo, pass mir die Kugel zu.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed02=Das Runde muss ins Runde.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed03=Es ist nur ein Spiel, sagst du? NUR EIN SPIEL? <evil laugh>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed04=Du denkst, es ist schwer, den Ball zwischen deinen Beinen durchzudribbeln? Dann probier's mal mit sechs Beinen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed05=Die Brennenden Hallen und die Hohen Tribünen stehen sich seit Äonen in den Ewigen Playoffs gegenüber. Nach dieser Saison schaffen wir endgültig ab, dass man mit zwei Punkten Vorsprung gewinnen muss.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed06=Die Talentscouts der Brennenden Hallen draften Lacuni immer am höchsten.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed07=Es gibt Dinge, die kann man nicht erklären! Wieso regnet es? Wieso bin ich sexy? Ich weiß es nicht!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed08=Übrigens, ich hab mal unter "Basketballspieler" im Lexikon nachgesehen und da steht, dass du keiner bist.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed09=<schnell gesprochen> Na ja, weißt du, man geht da raus und man gibt einfach 110 Prozent. Man will gut spielen und, weißt du, man hofft, dass man gut spielt.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed10=Erst zertrümmere ich das Brett. Und dann deine Welt.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed11=Du willst wissen, warum wir um die Herrschaft über Sanktuario kämpfen? Das Finale wird dort ausgetragen und wir wollen Heimvorteil.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed12=Ich habe genug von diesen Nephalem, die immer mit ihren Dunks angeben. Als ich ein Rookie war, ging es noch um die Grundlagen!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed13=Malthael war eines der größten Talente der Hohen Tribünen. Tja, sie hätten ihn halt nicht immer auf der Bank lassen sollen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed14=Du hast sehr viel ... du hast sehr viel ... <Pause> Was auch immer es ist, du hast sehr viel davon!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed15=Früher war mein Gesicht auf jeder Cornflakes-Packung. Aber dann haben die Kinder aufgehört, zu frühstücken. Keine Ahnung warum.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB00=Geh dazwischen!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB01=Denk bloß nicht, dass ich dir zupasse. <chuckle>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB02=Denk an deinen Laufweg!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Resurrected00=Ich bin wieder im Spiel!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Resurrected01=Nur ein Kratzer. Weiter geht's!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Revive00=Auf geht's in die Verlängerung.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Revive01=Schick mich wieder rein, Coach.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Revive02=Zeit für einen Rebound.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting00=Von der Dreierlinie!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting01=Für drei!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting02=Jeder Schuss ein Treffer!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting03=Blockt das!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Shooting04=Der ist im Kasten.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec00=Brutal.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec01=Ich verlass mich auf dich, Coach.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec02=Das wird ein heißes Replay!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec03=Damit wird niemand rechnen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec04=Brandheiß.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt00=Wie wollt ihr mich aufhalten, wenn ihr mich nicht mal sehen könnt?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt01=Ihr wollt mich? Dann kommt mich holen!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt02=Wer hat diese Flaschen in MEINE Halle gelassen?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/TeamKilled00=Nächstes Mal will ich da draußen mehr Einsatz sehen!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_ExLocked00=Wechsel mich ein, Coach!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_ExPurchased00=Na, sollen wir ein paar Körbe werfen?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Gift00=DU willst MICH abschieben? Ich hoffe, sie haben dir 'ne hübsche Ablösesumme versprochen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Lockin00=Jetzt wird gedunkt!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Purchase00=Ha. Erster im Draft.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Trial00=Ich spiele nur mit den Besten. Mal sehen, ob du's draufhast.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Trial01=Ein Probetraining? Wann geht's endlich richtig los?

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_VOX_Spun09=<Dizzy Exertion>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitLocked00=Ein Talentscout? Wenn du mich unter Vertrag nimmst, wirst du es nicht bereuen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitLocked01=Ich stehe frei!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitPurchased00=Hältst du mich für einen Bankwärmer? Das wirst du bereuen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitPurchased01=Beim Warten habe ich mir einen neuen Spielzug ausgedacht. Er heißt "hör auf, meine Zeit zu verschwenden, und fang endlich an, zu spielen".
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used00=HIER ist die heiße Zone!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used01=Alle in die Freiwurfzone!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used02=Achtet auf die Wurfuhr!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate2Used00=Huddle!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate2Used01=Ich brauche mein Team!

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/AI_Uhoh02=Welch Anmaßung!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack00=Unbedeutender Winzling!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack01=Spürt meinen Hass!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack02=Die Vernichtung ist unausweichlich!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack03=Es endet mit Blut!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack04=Ich werde dich verzehren.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack05=Niemand kann gegen mich bestehen!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack06=Ich trotze dir!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Celebrate00=Wie unterhaltsam ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Celebrate01=Ein wüstes Gelage soll diesem Sieg folgen!

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroAgree00=Mmm ... 
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroAgree01=Einverstanden.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroAgree02=Nur, weil ich es wünsche.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroBoast00=Die Sünde wird über alles herrschen!

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Sieh einer an ... wenn das mal nicht ein Nephalem ist.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Hmm. Und aus welchem Teil der Hölle stammst du?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Wie ich sehe, zieht jetzt auch der letzte Abschaum in den Kampf.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Du scheinst für die Schlacht bereit zu sein.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Prime00=Wir müssen uns diese Welt Untertan machen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroRespond00=Darauf habe ich nur gewartet.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroRespond01=Ich verfüge über die Mächte der Hölle.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroRespond02=Machst du mir ein Angebot?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Agree00=Mmm ... 
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=Was du da machst, würde ich nicht als "kämpfen" bezeichnen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Bedeutungsloses Wesen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Annoyed00=Du liebäugelst mit deinem Schicksal!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Chen00=Du bist also der Juwelenhändler des Nephalems.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Nach diesem kleinen Zwischenspiel wird Euer Tod nur um so süßer.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Du wurdest geschaffen, um zu sterben.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Du klingst wie ein Gefallener.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Du amüsierst mich nicht.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Worauf wartet ihr? Ich will sie leiden sehen!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Prime00=Du führst uns nur ins Verderben, Bruder. Ich allein entscheide über mein Leben.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill00=Arrogant und närrisch!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill01=Bedeutungsloses Wesen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill02=<dark laughter>
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill03=Boshaftigkeit belohnt sich selbst.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Kill04=Deine Schwäche überrascht mich nicht ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillButcher00=Schlächter abgeschlachtet.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillD3Hero00=Ich wusste, dass ich dich irgendwann kriegen würde, Nephalem.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillDiablo00=Sieh es als dauerhaftes Exil an.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Ich labe mich an deinem Stolz.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillTyrael00=Du wirst dich gut neben Inarius machen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/KillUther00=Hiermit ist dein "Licht" ausgelöscht.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Laugh00=<dark laugh>
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowLifeHeal00=Oh ... oh, ja.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowLifeHeal01=Sehr befriedigend.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowLifeHeal02=Gut gedient.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowMana00=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowMana01=Mein Mana schwindet.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/LowMana02=Nicht genug Mana.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/MatchEnd00=Was soll ich noch mal sagen?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/MatchEnd01=Was soll ich noch mal sagen?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/MatchEnd02=Was soll ich noch mal sagen?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/No00=Nein.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/No01=Das kann ich nicht.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/No02=Ein wertloser Befehl.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Unterstützt meinen Diener.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Zu mir!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AssistMe01=In den Kampf!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zerstört die Zitadelle unseres Feindes.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Diese Söldner werden jetzt versklavt.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Vernichtet dieses Fort!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Erobert diesen Beobachtungspunkt.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt meine Zitadelle.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verteidigt dieses Fort.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Verteidigt diesen Beobachtungspunkt.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ping_KillHero00=Dieser einfältige Held macht meine Pläne zunichte.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed00=Führt mich nicht in Versuchung.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed01=Bald werdet ihr mir alle dienen.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed02=Du gehst zu weit ... oder vielleicht nicht weit genug.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed03=Derart vermessen habe ich mich zuletzt im Kampf um die Bastion gefühlt!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed04=Du hältst dich für so schlau. Dachtest, du hättest alles unter Kontrolle. Meine Diener werden deine Maus finden. Dann <evil laugh> dann, endlich, werde ich, Azmodan, herrschen … als der Oberste Spieler. <evil laugh>
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed05=Mit den Sündenleutnants hat man nichts als Ärger. Faulheit liegt dumm rum. Zorn legt sich die ganze Zeit mit mir an. Stolz meint, Gier würde ihn beklauen. Neid ist eifersüchtig, dass Gier damit durchkommt. Völlerei versucht, jeden zu fressen. Und die Gebieterin der Lust ... ist eine einzige Ablenkung.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed06=Mit Engelszungen zu reden klingt irgendwie nach Teufelswerk. 
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed07=Diener, vergesst nie: Es gibt nichts Giftigeres und nichts Tödlicheres als ein Nephalemkind. Es muss euch nur anfassen, schon seid ihr tot!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed08=Ich will ja nicht die Engel an die Wand malen, aber hier ist nicht gerade die Hölle los.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed09=So ein Wahnsinn, warum schickst du mich schon wieder in die Höllen?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed10=Du glaubst, deine Familie sei furchtbar? Ich bin mit den Herrschern der Hölle aufgewachsen. Unsere Geschwisterstreitigkeiten haben ganze Reiche vernichtet.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed11=Wer glaubt, es gäbe nur sieben Todsünden, dem fehlt es lediglich an Vorstellungskraft.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed12=So langsam ist das hier schmerzhafter als meine Piercings.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed13=Haltet ein, Diener und Feinde. Bevor diese Schlacht zu meinen, Azmodans, Gunsten fortgeführt werden kann, muss ich zunächst einige Geschichtsbücher und ausführliche Pläne darüber schreiben und sie ... unauffindbar in der ganzen Welt verteilen ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed14=Geringes Übel? Höllie räumt den Magen auf. Schnell und zuverlässig. Zu Risiken und Nebenwirkungen fragen Sie Ihren Henker oder Medizinmann.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed15=<knurrt> <sauer> Nenn mich noch einmal Azzi!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB00=Los.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB01=Zerstören.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB02=Vorwärts, Diener.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB03=Töte sie!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB04=Schlachte sie in meinem Namen ab.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB05=Jetzt!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Resurrected00=Endlich kehre ich zurück.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Resurrected01=Mein Sieg ist gewiss.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive00=Ein Herrscher der Hölle kann nicht sterben!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive01=Mich hält niemand auf!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive02=Nichts als eine geringe Verzögerung.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec00=Reizvoll.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec01=Das wird mir gefallen ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec02=Mein Siegeszug wartet.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec03=Bemerkenswert ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec04=Macht durchströmt mich.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt00=Dein Schicksal ist besiegelt!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt01=Deine Anmaßungen toleriere ich nicht!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt02=Die Versuchung ist dazu da, dass du ihr nachgibst.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/TeamKilled00=Ein leerer Sieg. Schlussendlich werden wir triumphieren!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExLocked00=Ich bin der wahre Herrscher der Hölle!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Wo verstecken sich unsere Feinde?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Gift00=Ich unterwerfe sie alle.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Lockin00=Dann beginnt es also!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Purchase00=Eine kluge Wahl.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Trial00=Werdet Zeuge der Macht der Hölle!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Trial01=Du willst eine Abmachung mit mir eingehen?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Die Armeen der Hölle sind rastlos.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Schonmal über die Freuden der Sünde nachgedacht?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ja ... erfreue dich an meinem Anblick.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ich sehne mich nach Kampf und frischem Blut ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used00=Du denkst, du weißt, was Qualen sind?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used01=Ertrinkt in der Sündenflut!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used02=Fürchtest du das Ende?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used00=<laughs> Und du hast dich für so schlau gehalten ...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used01=Verwüstet diese Welt!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used02=Reißt sie in Stücke!

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/AI_Attack00=Hauen wir sie in die Pfanne ... nach Wikinger-Art.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/AI_Caution00=Ich habe ein ganz mieses Gefühl bei der Sache. Nee, echt.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/AI_GoodJob00=Hätte ich selbst nicht besser gekonnt!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/AI_Heal00=Huch, du brauchst einen Heilbrunnen.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/AI_Retreat00=Hier wird's mir zu ungemütlich.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/AI_Uhoh00=Tut mir leid, Kumpel.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Attack00=Ich werde dich vernichten wie ein Nordmann!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Attack01=Jetzt gibt's eins übergebraten!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Attack02=Der ist für dich, Freya!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Attack03=Für Boot und Beute!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Attack04=Wer braucht schon Pfeil und Bogen?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Attack05=Mal sehen, wie du damit fertigwirst!

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Healed00=Ich bin geheilt!? Ich liebe dieses Spiel.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Healed01=Daran könnt ich mich gewöhnen!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Healed02=Ah, Heilung! Freya ist mir hold.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroAgree00=Alles klar.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Habe ich schon mal gegen einen Verwandten von dir gekämpft?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Du gehst in diesem Zeitalter also als Held durch?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Du siehst viel nützlicher aus als Olaf und Erik. Das wird ein Spaziergang.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Bist du diese Hexe aus Transsilvanien?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroRespond00=Ich habe ein paar brandneue Schwerter und kann es kaum erwarten, sie auszuprobieren.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroResponse_Dwarf00=Öde? Wohl kaum. Wo wir sind, geht die Party ab.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Du sagst es, Freundchen.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Ja, ja. Red du nur.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Wenigstens bin ich hier nicht der Einzige, der Ahnung hat.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Kill00=Grüß Freya schön von mir.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Kill01=Vermöbelt wie einen Eisbären.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Kill02=Ha! Zerdrückt wie widerliches Gemüse!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Kill03=Ich hoffe, du hast dir das Levelpasswort notiert!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/KillArmored00=Geschieht dir recht, wenn du dich hinter all dem Schrott versteckst.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/KillETC00=Neue Hörner für meinen Helm!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/KillOrc00=Nimm das, Tomator!

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Laugh00=<dismissive snicker> 
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ich hatte schon die Tore von Walhalla vor Augen!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/LowLifeHeal01=Das war knapp.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/LowLifeHeal02=Stellst du mir das in Rechnung?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/LowMana00=Ich habe nur noch wenig Mana.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/No00=Seh ich so aus, als könnte ich das?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Wir sollten helfen, bevor unser Kumpel in Schwierigkeiten kommt.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich kann fast alles alleine, aber das nicht!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Treffen wir sie da, wo es wehtut. Greift die Zitadelle an!

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Verteidigt diesen Turm!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Ping_KillHero00=Töten wir den hier, sonst verliere ich die Beherrschung. Wieder mal.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed00=Für wen hältst du dich eigentlich, für Tomator?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed01=Hey! Wenn ich nicht hinter diesem Bildschirm wäre, dann ...
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed02=Ich hab 'nen Köcher voller Schwerter und weiß auch, wie man sie wirft.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed03=Ja, ich bin der Schreckliche. Hast du damit ein Problem?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed04=Moment mal, Wikinger sind die besten Navigatoren der Welt? Meine Freunde und ich machen definitiv was falsch ...
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Resurrected00=Wenigstens habe ich in diesem Spiel unendlich viele Leben.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Revive00=Ich bin wieder da, Baby!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Revive01=Einen echten Wikinger kriegt man nicht klein.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Revive02=Wie viele Leben haben wir noch?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Spec00=So machen wir das.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Spec01=Haha, das wird lustig.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Taunt00=Deine Mutter war ein Hamster und dein Vater roch schlimmer als Olaf.

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/What04=Ich warte.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/What05=Was?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/What_Evo00=Ja?

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Yes02=Lasst den Raubzug beginnen.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Yes03=Auf große Fahrt.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Yes04=Gibt's hier Aliens?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Yes05=Kein Problem.

VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_GoodJob02=Ha! Ein guter Kampf!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/AI_Heal00=Ihr seid verletzt. Geht schnell zu einem Heilbrunnen.

VoiceOver/Barbarian/Kill04=Euer Fleisch ist schwach!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillAzmodan00=Die Herrschaft der Sünde ist zu Ende.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillD3Hero00=Haha, ich liebe eine gute Prügelei.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillDiablo00=Das war für Leah!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillMagicUser00=Wie ich es verabscheue, meine Hände mit dem Blut dieser üblen Zauberer zu beschmutzen.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillSpreeEnd00=Ha, ich scheine Euch überlegen zu sein.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillStitches00=Zieht Euch doch etwas über.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillVarian00=Als Lo'Gosh habt Ihr mir besser gefallen.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillWarrior00=Gut gekämpft!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/KillZertatul00=Nur Feiglinge verstecken sich in den Schatten.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowLifeHeal00=Danke. Ich bin wieder gesund.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowLifeHeal01=Ihr habt mir das Leben gerettet ... Ich danke Euch.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowLifeHeal02=Ich stehe auf ewig in Eurer Schuld.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowMana00=Ich habe nur wenig Wut.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowMana01=Ich brauche Wut.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/LowMana02=Nicht genug Wut.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/MatchEnd00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/MatchEnd01=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/MatchEnd02=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/No00=Niemals.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/No01=Das ist unmöglich. Hört auf zu fragen.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/No02=Das kann ich nicht.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter braucht Hilfe.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich brauche Hilfe!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AssistMe01=Schnell, helft mir!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zerstört die Zitadelle des Gegners.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AttackMerc00=Ich denke, wir sollten uns dieses Söldnerlager schnappen.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Dieses Fort muss zerstört werden!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_AttackTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt einnehmen.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unsere Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verteidigt dieses Fort.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt verteidigen.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ping_KillHero00=Tötet diesen Helden!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed00=Warum belästigt Ihr mich?
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed01=Wählt Eure nächsten Worte mit Bedacht.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed02=Ich schwöre, die nächste Person, die mir auf Battle.net den Namen Barbie gibt, kriegt 'ne Axt in die Stirn.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed03=Bul-Kathos, ich habe noch niemals zu dir gebetet. Meine Lippen blieben verschlossen. Eines fernen Tages wird man nicht mehr wissen, wofür wir gekämpft haben und wofür wir gestorben sind. Das Einzige, was zählt, ist, dass fünf gegen fünf in den Kampf zogen. Deshalb bitte ich dich, erfülle mir einen Wunsch: Gib mir eine höhere Spielwertung! Und wenn du mir nicht hilfst, dann zum Teufel mit dir.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed04=Hm, mal sehen. Kämpfen mit dem Feind ... gemacht. Ihn verfolgen und vernichten ... ebenfalls. Sich erfreuen an dem Geschrei der Weiber ... ach, das lassen wir aus.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed05=Ihr! Tod durch Snu-Snu!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed06=Ich kenne meine Zukunft. Wenn Ihr so weitermacht, habt Ihr keine mehr.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed07=In meinem Stamm stehen die Männer am Herd und die Frauen ziehen in den Zickenkrieg.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed08=Ich schnetzel mich hier durch Horden von Gegnern und erhalte doch keine Beute. <frustriert> Dieses Spiel ergibt einfach keinen Sinn.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed09=Schon mal einen Albtraum gehabt, in dem Ihr in Unterwäsche auf der Arbeit erschienen seid? Ich auch, jeden Tag.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed10=Wenn ich jemals herausfinde, wer den Kettenbikini erfunden hat, dresche ich ihm die Nase ins Hirn.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed11=Auf meinen vielen Reisen hat mich einmal ein Dreckskerl gebeten, ihm ein Sandwich zu machen. Ich hab ihn dann in schön dünne Scheibchen geschnitten.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed12=Ich warte schon *ewig* auf echtes PvP.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed13=Moment, Moment, ich muss mir das notieren ... mit Rechtsklick renne ich, mit Rechtsklick greife ich an ... und was macht Linksklick schon wieder? Ach, ich hasse neue Steuerungen.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed14=Im Winter ziehe ich meinen dicksten Lendenschurz an.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed15=Blondinen haben vielleicht mehr Spaß. Aber Rothaarige ... MACHEN mehr Spaß!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Resurrected00=Ich schulde Euch mein Leben.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Resurrected01=Ich stehe in Eurer Schuld.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Revive00=Gewährt mir Stärke, Ihr Urahnen!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Revive01=Bul-Kathos lächelt auf mich herab!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Revive02=Meine Wut lässt sich nicht aufhalten.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Spec00=Meine Macht wächst.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Spec01=Die Urahnen gewähren mir Stärke.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Spec02=Ein Segen.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Spec03=Keiner kann sich mir stellen.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Spec04=Ich habe neue Kraft geschöpft.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Taunt00=Kriecht zurück zu Eurer Mutter!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Taunt01=Habt Ihr keine Ehre? Kämpft!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Taunt02=Bettelt um Gnade, Hund!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/TeamKilled00=Wir werden Rache üben!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_ExLocked00=Sprich, Frischling.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_ExPurchased00=Die Urahnen wachen über uns.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Gift00=Euer Verbündeter ist auch der meine.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Lockin00=Meine Klingen gehören Euch.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Purchase00=Eine gute Investition.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Trial00=Lassen wir meine Taten sprechen.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Trial01=Ich beweise Euch gern mein Können.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitLocked00=Ich bin das Warten leid. Stoßen wir unsere Klingen in die Herzen der Feinde.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitLocked01=Kommt! Unsere Feinde schreien förmlich danach, entzweigespalten zu werden.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitPurchased00=Worauf warten wir? Ich habe bald keine Wut mehr.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitPurchased01=Wenn Ihr mich weiter so anstarrt, reiß ich Euch die Augen aus dem schönen Kopf.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ultimate1Used00=Attacke!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ultimate1Used01=Zeit, zu sterben!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ultimate1Used02=Erzittert!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Ultimate2Used00=Ich biete dem Tod die Stirn!

VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Möchtet Ihr einen Schluck? Ich verspreche, davon bekommt man Haare am ganzen Körper!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_LiLi00=<SFX: Drinking> Ahh! Jetzt schon.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ahm ... also ... Ich ... Da fällt mir nichts zu ein.

VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_OfCourse00=Haha, natürlich!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Kommt ... Lasst uns kämpfen, um Heimat und Familie zu beschützen. Und für die Ehre.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Rexxar00=Lok'tar ogar, mein Freund.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Samuro00=Wenn ich im Kampf gebraucht werde, stehe ich bereit.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill00=Ihr vertragt wohl nicht so viel.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill01=Das sollten wir irgendwann wiederholen!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill02=Oh-ho-ho! Wie schmeckt Euch der Boden?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill03=Na das war doch mal ein guter Kampf!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill04=Wer gehört hier zu einer bedrohten Art?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillDwarf00=Oje ... manche Zwerge vertragen einfach nichts.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillLiLi00=Guter Einsatz, Li Li! Jetzt steh auf und wir versuchen das noch einmal.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillRexxar00=Na? Werdet Ihr so langsam alt, Rexxar?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSamuro00=Das Fass ist mächtiger als das Schwert.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSkeletonKing00=Hui, Ihr habt es mit der Diät aber wirklich übertrieben.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Jetzt ist Sperrstunde.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Laugh00=<lacht>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal00=Oha, danke ... Es wurde langsam ernst.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ah, das fühlt sich besser an.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal02=<kichert> Ich freue mich, dass Ihr da seid.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana00=Ich könnte jetzt ein gutes Bräu vertragen.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana01=Es wäre Zeit für ein Bräu.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana02=Wer braucht ein Bräu? ICH!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No00=Das denke ich nicht.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No01=Diesmal nicht.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No02=Und wie soll ich das anstellen?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Schnell, unserer Freund braucht Hilfe.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich könnte etwas Hilfe vertragen!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Freunde, steht mir bei!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Lasst uns die Zitadelle der Gegner angreifen!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Lasst uns dieses Söldnerlager einnehmen.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Zerstört dieses Fort!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt sichern.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt die Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Wir sollten dieses Fort verteidigen.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt verteidigen.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_KillHero00=Kann mal jemand diesen Helden kaltstellen.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed00=Hey, hallo!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed01=Braut sich da Ärger zusammen?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed02=Betont das Positive. Eliminiert das Negative.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed03=Natürlich, ich habe viele Geschichten zu erzählen. Möchtet Ihr eine hören? <Pause> Nur neun-fünfundneunzig die Minute.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed04=<liest Brief>Liebär Schen. Gannst du mir niescht etwas von dier schi-ken? Deine 'ut mit die Duft von lezte Nacht? Und vielleischt die gleine Silbärmünze? ... Und eine Fässchen von die Bräu, die so schön 'at geprickelt in mein Bauch-na-böl. <SFX: Papier wird gefaltet> Näh.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed05=Heimatbräu ist das beste Bräu. Das kann man direkt zuhause trinken!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed06=Wenn Ihr mal in der Nähe seid, schaut auf doch mal in der Brauerei Sturmbräu vorbei. Da gibt es immer etwas zu tun.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed07=Ein weiser Mann hat mal gesagt: "Ein leerer Krug muss nur gefüllt werden." <SFX: tapping on the side of a cup> <räuspert sich> Ähäm!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed08=Es ist entscheidend, dass Ihr Euer Bräu meistert, nicht andersrum.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed09=Oh, und viel Wasser trinken. Das ist auch wichtig.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed10=Nicht jeder, der umherwandert, hat sich verlaufen ... Ich meine, klar, ich habe mich verlaufen ... aber eben nicht JEDER.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed11=Bei einigen IST der Weg das Ziel.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed12=Das Ziel eines Wanderers ist zu beobachten ... und mit anderen Kulturen zu trinken. Mit diesem Wissen kann man ein erfülltes Leben leben. Das Ziel des Dunklen Wanderers hingegen ... ohje ... sagen wir einfach, es endet böse.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed13=Zu fragen, warum wir kämpfen, ist zu fragen, warum wir Heroes of the Storm spielen. Es liegt im Erlebnis. Vielleicht gibt es eine bessere Frage.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed14=Chen Sturmbräu, Braumeister. Fragt nach mir persönlich und akzeptiert keine billigen Kopien!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split00=Ja?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split01=Wir folgen dem Ruf.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split02=Erdaspekt: "Erde!" Feueraspekt: "Feuer!" <3. Stimme>: "LIEEEBE!" <Pause> Sturmaspekt: "Was war das?"
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split03=Feueraspekt: "Bei uns ist jeder Kill ein Dreifachkill."
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split04=Sturmaspekt: "Wer wind sät, wird von mir geerntet!"
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split05=Sturmaspekt: "Man könnte behaupten ..." Feueraspekt: "... wir haben eine gespaltene ..." Erdaspekt: "... Zunge." Sturmaspekt: "<seufzt> Persönlichkeit ... Also echt ... Geh in die Ecke und schäm dich."
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Resurrected00=Ich stehe in Eurer Schuld.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Resurrected01=<excited exertion> Ich schulde Euch etwas.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive00=Okay, ich bin wach! Ich bin wach!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive01=Aua! Das spüre ich noch immer!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive02=Frisches, kühles Bräu. Gibt's nur hier.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec00=Hey, so mag ich das!

VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Purchase00=Eine ausgezeichnete Entscheidung!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Trial00=Oh, möchtet Ihr gerne etwas Sturmbräu Fu lernen, ja?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Trial01=Es ist immer weise, Waren vorher zu prüfen.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Nehm Euch ruhig Zeit. Denn wenn wir uns niemals die Zeit nehmen, wie sollten wir dann jemals Zeit haben?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Ihr kommt mir bekannt vor. Sind wir uns nicht schon einmal in Pandaria begegnet?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Bereit für die nächste Runde? Nein? Gut, ich war sowieso durstig.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Oh nein, mein Bräu wird warm ... ich hasse es, wenn das passiert.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used00=Sturm, Erde und Feuer! Hört meinen Ruf!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used01=Elemente, erhört meinen Ruf.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate2Used00=Zeit, etwas kaputt zu machen!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate2Used01=<schnüffelt> Ich sollte dieses Fass öfter reinigen.

VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSelect00=Der Kreuzzug ruft. Macht Euch bereit!
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSelectPlayer00=Eine weitere Kreuzritterin! Es ist lange her, dass ich mit einer Schwester der Zakarum gereist bin.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSelectPlayer01=Ihr kommt mir merkwürdig bekannt vor ... Sind wir uns schon einmal begegnet? Oh, vielleicht in einer Schenke!
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSelectPlayer02=Wie ich sehe, ist es unter Kreuzrittern immer noch Mode, die Seiten zu rasieren. War meine Idee...
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSelect_Observer00=Ihr wollt es ruhiger angehen? Nun gut, schauen wir einfach zu!
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSlain00=Ihr wurdet getötet.
VoiceOver/CrusaderA/HeroSlain01=Tröstet Euch, das Licht hat Euch noch nicht verlassen.

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion01=Macht Euch bereit.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Erzählt unseren Gegnern dieses Mal nicht von unseren Plänen. Ich warne Euch. Nicht ein Wort.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Habt Ihr eigentlich mittlerweile gelernt, wie man Türen öffnet?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Ein weiterer Nephalem! Ich nehme an, die Diener der Hölle sind nun stärker geworden.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Hmm, sogar Dämonen sind in diesen Konflikt verwickelt?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_DiabloHero00=Ihr habt schon länger nicht mehr an einer Schlacht teilgenommen. Meint Ihr, dass Ihr noch dazu in der Lage seid?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Übel wie Ihr sollten nicht ungehindert umherstreifen dürfen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Ein weiteres brüchiges Zweckbündnis, ich verstehe.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil02=Eure Zeit läuft ab, Schurke!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good00=Es ist immer gut, mit Verbündeten zu kämpfen, an die ich glaube.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good01=Ah, Ihr seid es. Das macht die Sache ein wenig leichter.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good02=Lasst uns für das Gute kämpfen, seid Ihr bereit?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Imperius00=Könnt Ihr es denn ertragen, an der Seite eines Sterblichen zu kämpfen, Imperius?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Leoric, wie fühlt es sich eigentlich an, ausnahmsweise auf der richtigen Seite zu stehen?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Lord00=Ein Fürst der Hölle kämpft an meiner Seite? Die Endzeit muss wahrlich nahe sein.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=Habe ich Euch nicht schon mehrere Male getötet, Malthael?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Mephisto00=Der Herr des Hasses... Sehr beeindruckend, ganz bestimmt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Habt Ihr mein Angebot überdacht, Murky? Ich könnte einen fähigen Knappen gebrauchen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Denkt Ihr wirklich, dass Ihr das Zeug dazu habt, an meiner Seite zu kämpfen?

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Meint Ihr, dass Ihr Schritt halten könnt, Paladin?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond00=Ich bin stets bereit.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond01=Der Kreuzzug hat mich hierher geführt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond02=Immerzu.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Es ist nicht weise, einen Kreuzritter zu reizen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Ist das alles? Ich habe eigentlich erwartet, dass Ihr mir lang und breit erklärt, warum ich Euch niemals besiegen werde. Zum wiederholten Male.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Wirklich furchteinflößend. Vielleicht könntet Ihr das an unseren Feinden ausprobieren.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=Entschuldigt_... Wie bitte?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Nichtsdestotrotz werden wir ihnen einen guten Kampf liefern.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Deckard, vielleicht könnt Ihr mir den Rest nach der Schlacht erzählen?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Die Ansichten eines Dämons haben mich noch nie interessiert.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_DiabloHero00=Lasst uns unsere Gegner besiegen. Wir können uns später darüber Gedanken machen, wie wir nach Hause gelangen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=<sigh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil00=Ich würde lieber gegen Euch kämpfen als gemeinsame Sache mit Euch zu machen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil01=Die Welt wäre ein besserer Ort ohne Euch.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil02=Ist es zu spät, ein neues Bündnis zu schmieden?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=Das könnte mir gefallen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good00=So Akarat will.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good01=Ich werde Euer Schild sein.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good02=Wir werden das gemeinsam schaffen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Imperius00=Nun, Imperius, Ihr seid hier. Was bedeutet, dass ihre Anforderungen nicht allzu hoch sein können.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Ich glaube, ich hatte schon unangenehmere Gesellschaft. Sagt, habt Ihr jemals Lyndons Bekanntschaft gemacht?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Lord00=Das gilt auch für Euch, Dämon.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=Wir stehen auf der selben Seite, Malthael. Also werde ich Euch nicht vernichten ... jedenfalls nicht jetzt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto00=Ah, ah, ah! Mit Schmeicheleien erreicht Ihr gar nichts.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Weise Worte. Wie immer seid Ihr sehr wortgewandt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Wir werden für eine Weile Verbündete sein, also sollten wir uns zunächst auf unsere Gegner konzentrieren.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_No00=Das werde ich keiner Antwort würdigen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Wieder vereint! Keiner wird uns aufhalten können.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Auch ich freue mich darauf, Tyrael.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=Ja, mit mir. Niemand wird ein negatives Richturteil über Euch sprechen, wenn Ihr zwischendurch eine Pause braucht, denn ich bin eben eine Klasse für mich.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Äh ... Nein, so läuft das nicht.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill00=Akarat sei Euch gnädig. Denn ich werde es nicht sein.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill01=Der Kreuzzug kommt Euch holen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill02=Immerhin habt Ihr es versucht.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill03=Vielleicht klappt es ja beim nächsten Versuch.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill04=Heute ist nicht Euer Tag!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillAngel00=Zurück in die Himmel mit Euch!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillButcher00=Die Geister der Toten sind nun gerächt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDeckard00=Verzeiht, alter Freund. Vielleicht solltet Ihr etwas weniger reden.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDemon00=Selbst hier könnt Ihr Euch nicht vor mir verstecken, Dämon
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiablo00=Wie viele Male habe ich Euch nun schon getötet, Diablo? Ich komme gar nicht mehr mit.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiabloHero00=Eure Zeit ist vorüber.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillImperius00=Dieser Windbeutel war ohnehin überfällig.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillLeoric00=Zurück in Euer Grab, Leoric.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillMephisto00=Wart Ihr nicht das schlaueste der drei Übel?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillNephalem00=Verzeiht mir, Nephalem.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Genug ist genug!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillTyrael00=Das Zeitalter der Nephalem ist herangebrochen, alter Freund.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillUther00=Paladine. Hah!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillWhitemane00=Eine Fanatikerin weniger.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh00=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh01=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh02=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh03=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh04=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal00=Das war knapp!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ihr versteht Euch aufs Heilen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal02=Keinen Augenblick zu früh.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana00=Mein Mana reicht dafür nicht aus.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana01=Nicht genug Mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana02=Ich benötige mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No00=Nein.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No01=Das kann ich nicht.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No02=Unmöglich.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter benötigt Unterstützung!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich benötige Eure Hilfe!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Ich könnte Eure Hilfe gebrauchen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Auf zur gegnerischen Zitadelle! Es ist höchste Zeit!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten uns mit diesen Söldnern anfreunden.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Lasst uns dieses Fort stürmen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Nehmt diesen Beobachtungspunkt ein.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Sammelt Euch zur Verteidigung an unserer Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verteidigt dieses Fort.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Verteidigt diesen Beobachtungspunkt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_KillHero00=Dieser Held sollte erledigt werden – und zwar bald.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed00=Ich grüße Euch.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed01=Ja? Was braucht Ihr?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed02=Warum klickt Ihr mich die ganze Zeit an und nicht meine Gegner oder Beute? Was für ein Spiel ist das eigentlich hier?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed03=Ihr wollt einen Witz hören? Wenn Ihr darauf besteht, kann ich sicher dienlich sein.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed04=Ein Kreuzritter, ein Paladin und ein Templer kommen in eine Taverne. Und der Wirt fragt sie: Was darf's denn heute NICHT sein? <laugh> ... nein?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed05=... nun, nicht jeder ist hart genug für den Humor der Kreuzritter.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed06=Eines Tages werde ich den Glauben der Zakarum von allem Bösen geläutert haben und der Kreuzzug wird enden. Manchmal frage ich mich, was ich dann tun werde ... Ach, ich bin mir sicher, es wird immer jemanden geben, der bestraft werden möchte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed07=Wie "bei Stufe 30 ist Schluss"? Haben die hier im "Nexus" denn noch nie etwas von Paragonstufen gehört?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed08=Wisst Ihr, was das wichtigste ist, wenn man eine schwere Rüstung trägt? Denkt niemals, wirklich NIEMALS daran, wie ungeheuer kratzig das Ganze ist ... <complaining exertion> Na wunderbar, das kann ja heiter werden ...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed09=Oh, Akarat, segne diesen heiligen Flegel, so dass durch ihn Deine Feinde in winzig kleine Stücke geprügelt werden mögen. Wie in den Himmeln, so auch in den Höllen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed10=Ich nahm den Namen meiner Meisterin an, so wie sie einst den Namen ihrer Meisterin annahm. Eines Tages wird mein Knappe meinen Namen annehmen und selbst einen Knappen finden, der diesen Namen einmal annehmen wird. Ja, ich weiß, dass das ein wenig verwirrend klingt. Alles, was ich sagen will, ist: Wir haben alle den gleichen Namen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed11=Ihr verstoßt damit bestimmt gerade gegen irgendein Gebot. Vermutlich "Du sollst nicht wie ein Wahnsinniger auf armen Kreuzrittern rumklicken, als hättest du kein Leben!"
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed12=Irgendein betrunkener Kerl verwechselte mich gestern mit einem Templer. Als ich ihn fragte, ob er mich jemals 'PRÄCHTIG' hätte rufen hören, antwortete er: "Ja, gerade eben." Ein echter Witzbold, schade nur, dass er nicht mehr unter uns weilt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed13=Klickt mich noch einmal an, und ich schwöre Euch bei Akarat: Ich schneide Euren Finger ab. Oder das, womit auch immer Ihr mich davon abhaltet, an dieser Schlacht teilzunehmen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected00=Ich stehe in Eurer Schuld.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected01=Meinen Dank.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive00=Ich bin zurück!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive01=Ich nehme den Kampf wieder auf.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive02=Ich sollte mir bald einen Knappen besorgen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec00=Gute Wahl.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec01=Ausgezeichnet.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec02=Ich erstarke im Licht!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec03=So sollte es auch sein.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec04=Ich denke, Ihr habt die richtige Wahl getroffen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt00=Wenn es unter Euch irgendwelche wahren Helden gibt, könnt Ihr sie zu mir schicken.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt01=Ihr wäret den Strapazen eines Kreuzzugs beileibe nicht gewachsen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt02=Selbst mein Knappe könnte es mit Euch aufnehmen. Und dabei habe ich noch nicht mal einen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/TeamKilled00=Ich habe schon Schlimmeres durchlebt. Gebt die Hoffnung nicht auf.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExLocked00=Ich grüße Euch.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ein alter Freund kehrt zurück.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Gift00=Ihr seid äußerst großzügig.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Lockin00=Der Kreuzzug ruft.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Purchase00=Ihr wählt weise.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial00=Ja, ich denke wir sollten es versuchen. Was denkt Ihr?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial01=Ihr wollt Euch dem Kreuzzug anschließen?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Ihr lasst Euch Zeit, bevor Ihr eine endgültige Entscheidung trefft. Sehr weise.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Ihr seid eher von der nachdenklichen Sorte, nicht wahr?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Der Kreuzzug ruft uns beide.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ah ... die Stille hat etwas Schönes an sich. Was gut ist, denn Schönheit ist wenigstens vergänglich.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate1Used00=Spürt den Zorn der Himmel.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used00=Mein Glaube ist mein Schild.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used01=Keinen Schritt weiter.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used02=Halt!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used03=Da, fangt!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used04=Bis hierher und nicht weiter.

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/WorthIt00=Es hat sich immerhin gelohnt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/WorthIt01=Akarat ist mir wohlgesonnen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes00=Ja.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes01=Nun gut.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes02=Dorthin?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes03=So Akarat will.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes04=Natürlich.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes05=Ihr könntet recht haben.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes06=Warum nicht?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes07=Der Kreuzzug ruft.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes08=Ich eile.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack00=Zum Angriff, los!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack01=Wir müssen angreifen, so lange sie geschwächt sind.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack02=Angriff! Lasst erst nach, wenn sie alle tot sind!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Caution00=Vorsicht!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Caution01=Haltet die Augen auf!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob00=Lok-tar!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob01=Gar nicht mal so schlecht.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob02=Ha ha ha!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Heal00=Die Wunde sieht tief aus. Macht, dass Ihr zu einem Heilbrunnen kommt!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Heal01=Ihr macht es nicht mehr lange. Geht Euch heilen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Retreat00=Ich kehre in unsere Basis zurück.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Retreat01=Ich bin gleich wieder zurück, lasst mir ein paar übrig!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Uhoh00=<growl>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Uhoh01=Nein!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Uhoh02=Ein Verbündeter ist gefallen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Attack00=Zeit, zu sterben!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Attack01=Ich kämpfe für meinen Klan!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Attack02=Kniet nieder vor dem Kriegshymnenklan!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Attack03=Keine Gefangenen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Attack04=Macht alles nieder!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Attack05=Die Horde marschiert voran!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Attack06=Blut und Donner!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Celebrate00=Ein glorreicher Sieg!

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Healed01=Gute Arbeit, Heiler!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Healed02=Das tut gut.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroAgree00=<laugh> Ja!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroAgree01=Mein Schild gehört Euch!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroAgree02=Ich kämpfe an Eurer Seite, Krieger!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroBoast00=Wir werden unseren Feinden Tod und Zerstörung bringen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroBoast01=Wir werden sie zermalmen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion00=Seid Ihr bereit, Welpe?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion01=Die Trommeln des Krieges ertönen! Macht Euch bereit, Krieger!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=Allianz. Pah.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_AurielSpirit00=Ich kämpfe zusammen mit einem Geistheiler. Das wird mir niemand glauben.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Ihr seht aus wie ein Mensch, aber ... hmm, ich werde Euch im Auge behalten.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Ein Dämon? Schade. Ich hatte auf einen Verbündeten gehofft, der ab und zu auch mal gewinnt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Der Kriegshymnenklan verbündet sich nicht freiwillig mit dem Bösen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Ich habe nichts gemein mit Euch. Kommt mir nicht in die Quere.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil02=Ihr? Ugh. Ahnen, steht mir bei ...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Garrosh. Nicht alle vom Kriegshymnenklan sind bereit, Euch in Eurem Wahnsinn zu folgen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Gazlowe00=Gazlowe? Ha. Das sollte unterhaltsam werden.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good00=Ihr gehört zu diesen einfältigen Weltverbesserern, oder? Ihr seht jedenfalls so aus.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good01=Ich bin froh, wenigstens einen Krieger mit Ehre an meiner Seite zu haben.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good02=Ah, Ihr seid's. Das könnte sogar funktionieren.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Lok'tar!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_JunkratGoblin00=Haltet Euch hinter mir und jagt alles in die Luft, was uns in die Quere kommt!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Ein weiterer von Sylvanas Lakaien, wie ich annehme?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Wartet, Ihr seid zu dritt? Denkt Ihr, dass Ihr mit mir mithalten könnt?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Ein Murloc! Früher habe ich Euch im Vorbeigehen immer einen Tritt verpasst! <laugh> Oh, tut mir leid.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Negative00=<scoff> Ich bin es so leid, ständig mit Schwächlingen zusammenzukämpfen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Ha, Ihr seht aus wie ein echter Krieger.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Kriegshäuptling Thrall. Es ist mir eine Ehre.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Ich erkenne die Rüstung von Lordaeron, Paladin. Wir vom Kriegshymnenklan haben Eure Lager nicht vergessen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Whitemane00=Eine von diesen scharlachroten Fanatikern? <spit> Lächerlich.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Yrel00=Eine Draenei? Das hätte ich nicht erwartet.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond00=Lok'tar ogar!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond01=Ich fühle bereits, wie der Zorn mein Blut zum Brodeln bringt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond02=Das werdet Ihr erfahren, wenn die Tore sich öffnen. 
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Keine Sorge, Allianzhund. Die Horde wird diese Schlacht für Euch gewinnen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Angry00=Ich werde Euch jeden Knochen einzeln brechen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_AurielSpirit00=Ein Geistheiler? Bin ich etwa gestorben?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Butcher00=<Growls back>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Confused00=Was war das für ein Geräusch? Hat das Ding geredet?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Ich kenne Euch nicht, Mensch. Und das kann auch so bleiben.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Demon00=Die Orcs haben genug von Euresgleichen, Dämon.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Ich habe nicht nach Eurer Meinung gefragt, Welpe!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil00=Ruhe jetzt! Die Schlacht beginnt. Ich kümmere mich später um Euch.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil01=Ich werde daran denken, wenn wir uns als Feinde gegenüberstehen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil02=Ich bin hier, um den Feind zu bekämpfen, nicht Euch. Aber wenn Ihr es nicht anders wollt ...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Excited00=<laugh> Sehr gut!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Zumindest in diesem Punkt sind wir uns einig.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Gazlowe00=Müde und gereizt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good00=Es ist gut, zusammen mit Kriegern zu kämpfen, denen ich vertrauen kann.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good01=Ehre wird unser Schild sein.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good02=Stärke.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Horde00=Für die Horde!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_JunkratGoblin00=Macht Ihr Euch etwa über mich lustig? Ich breche Euch alle Knochen im Leib!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Wessen Tod hat Euch zum König gemacht?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=Was ist Tomator? Ist das was zu essen?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Murky00=Und da heißt es immer, Orcisch wäre schwer zu verstehen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Negative00=Seid einfach still.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_No00=Habt Ihr den Verstand verloren? Natürlich nicht.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Positive00=Sehr gut. Ich kann die Schlacht kaum erwarten!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Oh, natürlich. <scoff>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Lok-narash!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Uther00=Gebt Ruhe, Mensch. Ich bin auch nicht glücklich darüber.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Wagt es noch einmal, so mit mir zu reden, Blasshaut, und ich zeige Euch, wo Euer Platz ist!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Yrel00=Wie edelmütig von Euch. Und jetzt seid still und kämpft, Draenei.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill00=Blut und Donner!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill01=Das hat gutgetan.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill02=Ihr hattet keine Chance!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill03=Was war das denn? Pah!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill04=Der Nächste! Bringt mir den Nächsten!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill05=Wie Stahl, der Knochen durchschlägt.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillAlliance00=Allianzabschaum.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillAngel00=Diese Geistheiler werden immer aggressiver.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillChogall00=Nehmt das, Verräter! Alle beide!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillCrusader00=Sah dieser Mensch aus wie ich oder hab ich mir das eingebildet?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillDemon00=Sieht aus, als bräuchte die Brennende Legion neue Rekruten.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillDwarf00=Alterac gehört den Frostwölfen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillGuldan00=Ihr verdient ein weit schlimmeres Ende, Hexer!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillHorde00=Ihr seid ehrenvoll gefallen, Krieger der Horde.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillLeoric00=Kehrt bald zurück, damit ich Euch noch einmal töten kann.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillNephalem00=Überraschend stark ... für einen Menschen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillNightElf00=Ha! Ein Nachtelfenkopf! Najak wird sich freuen.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillSpreeEnd00=Euer Blutrausch ist zu Ende, Welpe!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillSylvanas00=<scoff> Ihr seid nicht mein Kriegshäuptling ...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillUther00=Paladine. Pah.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillWarchief00=Ich hatte gedacht, ein früherer Kriegshäuptling ist schwerer zu töten.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillWhitemane00=Selbstgefällige Göre.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh01=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh02=<large laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh03=<aggressive laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal00=Oh ja!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal01=Meine Kraft kehrt zurück!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal02=Ich danke Euch. Und jetzt: Zurück in den Kampf!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana00=Nicht genug Mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana01=Ich brauche mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana02=Soll das ein Witz sein? Ich hab kein Mana mehr!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd00=Der Sieg ist mein!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd01=Ich diene mit Stolz.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd02=Es war mir eine Ehre.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No00=Hah, nein.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No01=Niemals!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No02=Habt Ihr nicht Besseres zu tun?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistHero00=Ein Verbündeter ist in Not!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistMe00=Kämpft an meiner Seite!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistMe01=Schickt mir Verstärkung!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackCastle00=Bringt sie zur Strecke! Vernichtet ihre Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackMerc00=Diese Söldner werden uns dienen – kümmert euch darum!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Lasst uns gemeinsam dieses Fort angreifen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackTower00=Nehmt diesen Beobachtungspunkt ein.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unsere Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verteidigt dieses Fort!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendTower00=Verjagt den Feind von diesem Beobachtungspunkt!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_KillHero00=Ich will diesen Helden tot sehen!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed00=Mok'ra.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed01=Was wollt Ihr von mir?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed02=Lasst mich in Frieden!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed03=Stupst mich noch einmal an!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed04=Hah, daneben!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed05=Jetzt reicht's! Das tragen wir im PvP aus, hier und jetzt!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed06=Mir war mal, als hätte ich eine menschliche Version von mir auf dem Schlachtfeld gesehen. So ein geschniegeltes Blondchen. Pah, allein der Gedanke daran ... ekelhaft.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed07=Ihr denkt, 30 Minuten sind lang? Ich hab damals im Alteractal 2 Tage am Stück durchgekämpft! Das wäre alles etwas schneller gegangen, wenn sich nicht alle ständig in Höhlen versteckt hätten, aber das nur nebenbei.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed08=Ich habe mal meinen Mann im Brachland verloren. Er war schon halb verwest, als ich ihn endlich gefunden hatte.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed09=Manche Menschen sehen uns Orcs als edle Krieger, die zu Unrecht als brutal verschrien sind. Ach, der Gesichtsausdruck, wenn ich ihnen die Zähne ausschlage, ist einfach unbeschreiblich.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed10=Ist Euch einmal aufgefallen, dass Orcquestgeber die Gemeinsprache sprechen, aber Orcabenteurer nicht? Muss ich das verstehen?

VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Ping_Transport01=Wir müssen das jetzt fortbringen.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Ping_TurnIn00=Sollten wir das nicht abgeben?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Ping_TurnIn01=Wir müssen jetzt abliefern.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed00=Hass muss mit Disziplin gezügelt werden.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed01=Solange Dämonen auf dieser Welt ihr Unwesen treiben, wird meine Jagd nicht zu Ende sein.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed02=Des Dämonenjägers höchstes Gebot: Was du nicht kennst, das schieße tot. <kurze Pause> Und danach erschieß es noch einmal.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed03=Finger weg, sonst Finger ab.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed04=Könnt Ihr nicht jemand anderen nerven? Freunde, Verwandte ... giftige Reptilien?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed05=<reißt Blütenblätter ab> Ich hasse Euch, ich hasse Euch sehr, ich hasse Euch, ich hasse Euch sehr ...
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed06=Stirbt der Dämon im Oktober, braucht er im Winter keinen Pullover.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed07=Nicht genug Hass.<kurze Pause> Kleiner Scherz. Ich habe mehr als genügend Hass übrig für Euch.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed08=<phone rings> Hallo? Wer ist da? Ich kenne keine "Dunkelheit". Ich glaube, Ihr habt den falschen Dämonenjäger erwischt. Ja, ja ... tschüss.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed09=Das ist – dafür – dass du – zu viel – auf mir – rumklickst! Geh zu deiner Mami!
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed10=Wenn Ihr das in Diablo III probieren würdet, müsste ich nicht einmal reagieren ... Das vermisse ich langsam wirklich.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed11=Wie ich mit Absätzen renne? Besser als Ihr, so viel ist sicher.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed12=<angewidert> Wie viele Leute muss ich denn hier noch umbringen, damit ich endlich einen legendären Gegenstand kriege? ... Na gut, einer geht noch.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed13=Die Dämonen haben mein Dorf niedergebrannt und meine Familie massakriert ... Ich will doch den Gefallen nur erwidern.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Pissed14=<seufz> Mit einem Begleiter wäre das alles viel einfacher ... Wo zur Hölle ist Kormac, wenn man ihn mal braucht?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Resurrected00=Ihr habt meinen Dank.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Resurrected01=Danke, das habe ich gebraucht.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/RevengeEnd00=Die Rache ist mein!
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/RevengeEnd01=Ha! Reicht es Euch schon?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/RevengeEnd02=Ich fange gerade erst an.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/RevengeStart00=Ich sehe eine große Zielscheibe auf Eurer Stirn ...
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/RevengeStart01=Ich werde mich rächen.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/RevengeStart02=Jetzt werdet Ihr sterben.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Revive00=Rache!
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Revive01=Genug gewartet. Auf geht's!
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Revive02=Gut, dann fangen wir von vorne an ...
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_Dance00=<lacht> Und das in Stöckelschuhen.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_Dance01=So zu tanzen erfordert einiges an Disziplin.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_Goodbye00=Lebt wohl.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_Goodbye01=Bleibt wachsam.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_Hello00=Seid gegrüßt.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_Hello01=Grüße.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_Sorry00=Es tut mir leid, ich habe falsch gehandelt.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_Sorry01=Mein Fehler.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_Thanks00=Oh, vielen Dank.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_Thanks01=Ihr habt meinen Dank.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_WellPlayed00=Gar nicht mal so schlecht.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Social_WellPlayed01=Gut gespielt.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Spec00=Eine hervorragende Wahl.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Spec01=Ich fühle mich stärker.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Spec02=Das sollte nützlich sein.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Spec03=Jetzt hält mich nichts mehr auf.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Spec04=Perfekt.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Taunt00=Ihr entkommt mir nicht!
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Taunt01=War das alles?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Taunt02=Dass ich nicht lache.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/TeamKilled00=Das war nicht gerade eine Glanzleistung.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_ExLocked00=Kann ich Euch helfen?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_ExPurchased00=Ich grüße Euch.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_Gift00=Lebt wohl.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_Lockin00=Ich bin bereit.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_Purchase00=Zusammen sind wir unschlagbar.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_Trial00=Ihr wollt mich auf die Probe stellen?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_Trial01=Ich kann Euch einige Taktiken zeigen.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_WaitLocked00=Meine Jagd muss weitergehen.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_WaitLocked01=Wollt Ihr nicht mit mir Rache üben?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ich sehne mich nach einem Kampf. Wollen wir uns anmelden?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_WaitPurchased01=<seufzt> Das Schlimmste am Jagen ist das ewige Warten.
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Ultimate1Used00=Fahrt zur Hölle!
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Ultimate1Used01=Spürt meine Rache!
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/Ultimate2Used00=Der Tod erwartet Euch!

VoiceOver/Diablo/LowMana02=Nicht genug Mana.
VoiceOver/Diablo/No00=Nein.
VoiceOver/Diablo/No01=Unmöglich.

VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed03=Angst ist nicht immer eine Illusion.
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed04=In den Staub!
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed05=Ist es heiß hier drin oder bin ... hm. Wahrscheinlich bin ich das.
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed06=Das ist aber eine schöne Seele, die du da hast ... Da wäre es doch sehr schade, wenn ihr etwas passieren würde.
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed07=Me llamo Diablo. Vengo de los Infiernos Abrasadores. ¿Dónde está la biblioteca?
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed08=Denkt daran, Kinder: Schaut in beide Richtungen, bevor ihr über die Straße geht.
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed09=Wer bist du? RAUS AUS MEINEM KOPF!
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed10=Schon vom Krieger gehört, der meinte, er könnte einen Seelenstein in seinen Kopf rammen? Spannende Geschichte.
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed11=Ich bin gar nicht so böse, es versteht mich nur keiner.
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed12=Du solltest aufpassen, dass du nach dem Tode nicht in die Hölle kommst.
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed13=Alle Übel sind schon da, alle Übel, alle. Welch ein Brüllen, randaliern, quälen, foltern, malträtiern ...
VoiceOver/Diablo/Pissed14=Nach diesem Auftritt sollte ich mich wirklich bei "Sanktuario sucht den gefallenen Superstern" bewerben.
VoiceOver/Diablo/Resurrected00=Passabel, Untertan.

VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed03=Manchmal ergibt drei ... plus vier ... eins.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed04=In Höllenkreisen erzählt man sich von einem Ort regenbogenfarbener Glückseligkeit, an dem Einhörner und knuddelige Teddybären umherstreifen. Nun ja, sicher ist diese Grafschaft Launebach nur ein Ammenmärchen, um Dämonen Angst zu machen.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed05=Leah: (schwach) Kann mich jemand hören? Ihr müsst mir helfen! Helft mir ... Diablo: ... die Welt mit Schrecken zu überziehen.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed06=Hmm. Vielleicht haben diese Höllentore ja doch einen Zweck erfüllt.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed07=Du willst wissen, wie es ist, sechs Übel in sich zu vereinen? Stell dir vor, du lebst mit ein paar ziemlich unangenehmen Zeitgenossen auf engstem Raum zusammen. Und keiner von ihnen verlässt jemals das Haus ...

VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed09=Nein ... die Münder auf meinen Schultern sprechen nicht. <Mouths: Screech!> Das machen sie ... <Mouths: Screech!> Und sie hören einfach nicht damit auf!
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed10=Du willst wissen, wie Furcht schmeckt!? ... wie Hühnchen. (grumbling) Alles schmeckt wie Hühnchen.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed11=Es ist ganz einfach ... die Großen Übel verbinden sich mit den Geringen Übeln und verschmelzen so zum Obersten Übel. Noch Fragen?
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed12=Rückwärtsbotschaften rückwärts abzuspielen ist immer Zeitverschwendung ... glaub mir.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed13=Meine Macht scheint begrenzt zu sein in diesem ... Nexus. Es spielt keine Rolle ... alle Welten werden vor mir brennen.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Pissed14=Hach, hier fühle ich mich einfach wie im siebten Himmel.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Resurrected00=Passabel, Untertan.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/Resurrected01=Wie es vorhergesagt wurde.

VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/UI_Purchase00=Der Schrecken wird herrschen!
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/UI_Trial00=Ein Versuch reicht ...
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/UI_Trial01=Es beginnt.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/UI_WaitLocked00=Fürchte dich nicht ...
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/UI_WaitLocked01=Stell dir nur vor ... Du könntest über die Mächte der Hölle verfügen.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ich bin geduldig, aber nicht so geduldig.
VoiceOver/DiabloPrime/UI_WaitPurchased01=Beeile dich, Untertan, das Licht der Himmel wird sich nicht von selbst auslöschen.

VoiceOver/DragonKnight/Pissed08=Wisst Ihr eigentlich, wie schwer es ist, mit dieser Stimme Witze zu machen?
VoiceOver/DragonKnight/Pissed09=Bin ich ein Drache, der ein Ritter ist, oder ein Ritter, der ein Drache ist?
VoiceOver/DragonKnight/Pissed10=Ich habe sie immer nur aus Notwehr gekaut. Aber nie runtergeschluckt. <lacht>
VoiceOver/DragonKnight/Revive00=Ich werde stärker.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Attack02=Genug Zeit verschwendet. Schlagen wir zu!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Caution00=Ich glaube, sie haben uns durchschaut. Seid vorsichtig.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_GoodJob00=Das war klasse.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_GoodJob01=Unglaublich!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_GoodJob02=Das muss ich den anderen Dryaden erzählen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Heal00=Ihr seht etwas angeschlagen aus. Heilt Euch am besten am Brunnen!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Heal01=Von allein wächst das nicht wieder nach. Heilt Euch.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Retreat00=Ziehen wir uns lieber zurück.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Retreat01=Ich muss mich zurückziehen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Uhoh00=Nein!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Uhoh01=Wer hat Euch erlaubt, zu sterben?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/AI_Uhoh02=Das darf nicht sein ...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Attack00=Eindringlinge!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Attack01=Der Wald erhebt sich.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Attack02=Dies war niemals Euer Land.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Attack03=Ein Dorn in Eurem Auge!

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Attack05=Kostet meinen Speer!

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Healed01=Nachwachsen!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Healed02=Wie frisch aus dem Ei gepellt.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroAgree00=Natürlich.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroAgree01=Die Idee wächst mir ans Herz.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroAgree02=Ich weiß, was Ihr meint.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroBoast00=Benehmen wir uns wie die Axt im Walde.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroBoast01=Die Wilden besiegen die Gezähmten jedes Mal.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion00=Seid Ihr für eine wilde Schlacht bereit?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion01=Ihr seht aus, als könntet Ihr Bäume ausreißen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Chogall00=Wie könnt Ihr hier nur Euer Gesicht zeigen? ... oder äh Gesichter.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Dryad00=Seid gegrüßt, Schwester.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Greymane00=Ah, der Mann mit dem Wolfsblut.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Hearthstone00=Der Wald erhebt sich.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=Ihr habt Euch den ganzen Weg hierher begeben, Erzdruide?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Monk00=Was schaut Ihr mich so an?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Oha, ich bin etwas eingerostet ... <versucht "Hallo" in Murlocsprache zu sagen>Mrrglr?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Wieso tragt Ihr den Tod in dieses Land?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Wieso nur soll ich jemandem wie Euch helfen?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Na Ihr seid ein Verbündeter, wie man ihn sich wünscht.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroRespond00=Warum wäre ich sonst hier?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroRespond01=Natürlich. Darum geht es doch.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroRespond02=Ihr wisst ja gar nicht, was ich hier entfesseln werde.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Alexstrasza00=Natürlich. Darum geht es doch.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Es gibt Raubtiere und es gibt Beute. Ihr seid womöglich nicht das, wofür Ihr Euch haltet.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Alle Lebewesen haben einen Platz ... selbst die ungehobelten.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Chogall00=Da möchte ich sie lieber brennen sehen!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=War das eine frische Brise oder habt Ihr was gesagt?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=Verglichen mit diesem Ort wirkt der Smaragdgrüne Traum normal.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Greymane00=Das heißt hoffentlich nicht, dass Ihr an den Bäumen hier Euer Revier markiert.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=Glaubt Ihr etwa, das Wort eines Sterblichen verletzt das Kind eines Gottes?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=<lacht peinlich berührt> Eh-hehe-he, schön ... Euch zu sehen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Monk00=Hoffentlich ist das nicht das Einzige, mit dem sie Euch bereichern.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Mrglrlg. Mrgglr!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Behaltet Eure Skelette einfach für Euch, ja?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Habt Ihr schon mal versucht, Euch in Luft aufzulösen?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Das könnte Spaß machen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Na Ihr seid mir aber eine welke Blume.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=Äh, ja ... ich tu dann mal so, als wäre alles normal.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill00=Dünger für die Pflanzen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill01=Ihr bekommt, was Ihr verdient.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill02=Wie man in den Wald hineinruft ...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill03=Ihr werdet eins mit dem Wald.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill04=Es musste ja so enden ...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillDryad00=Warum müssen wir uns bekriegen, Schwester?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillGazlowe00=Scheint, als hättet Ihr einen Getriebeschaden.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillGreymane00=Ah, doch nur ein Mensch im Wolfspelz.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillIllidan00=Habt Ihr nicht schon genügend Welten verdammt?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillMalfurion00=Ich hätte mehr von Euch erwartet, Malfurion.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Da wird der Jäger zum Gejagten.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillTechCharacter00=So viel Metall ... zu nichts gut.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowLifeHeal00=Das habe ich gebraucht!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowLifeHeal01=Uff, vielen Dank.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowLifeHeal02=Gleich viel besser.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana00=Ich habe nur wenig Mana.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana01=Mein Mana ist niedrig.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana02=Klasse. Mir fehlt Mana.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/No00=So nicht!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/No01=Nicht wirklich, nein.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/No02=<hust> Unmöglich.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Dieser Verbündete braucht uns.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Es wird Zeit, dass wir als Team agieren, also helft mir!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Ich könnte hier Hilfe gebrauchen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Reißt die gegnerische Zitadelle ein!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Schnappt Euch dieses Söldnerlager!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Vernichtet dieses schreckliche Fort!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Wir müssen diesen Beobachtungspunkt einnehmen!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Unsere Zitadelle benötigt Schutz!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Lasst unser Fort nicht fallen!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Dieser Beobachtungspunkt ist ohne uns verloren.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_KillHero00=Wir sollten diesen Helden zur Strecke bringen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed00=Ich bin die Erste der Dryaden.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed01=Der Wald benötigt keinen Schutz, Ihr jedoch schon.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed02=Wir werden uns zurückholen, was die Sterblichen gestohlen haben.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed03=Cenarius, mein Vater, hat die Macht, doch ich habe die Entschlossenheit.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed04=Versteht mich nicht falsch, Sterbliche sind sehr gut darin, sich gegenseitig umzubringen. Doch die Wildnis kann das noch viel besser.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed05=Mit den Pflanzen im Garten der Ängste stimmt irgendetwas nicht ... Womit gießen sie die nur?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed06=Dryaden sind keine Grasfresser. Das ist eine Beleidigung.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed07=Und um ehrlich zu sein, esse ich nur Bio-Gemüse. Und das würdet Ihr auch, wenn die Goblins in Eurer Heimat Bergbau betrieben.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed08=Man könnte sagen, ich bin eine Naturgewalt.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed09=Geht und spielt draußen, haben sie Euch gesagt ... Da muss man keine Angst vor haben, haben sie Euch gesagt ... Die haben mich wohl noch nie getroffen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed10=... und sie so: "Ich bin ja so ungezogen, ich bin ja so ungezogen!" Da hab ich ihr gesagt, wenn sie nicht die Klappe hält, kommt sie in die Leimfabrik!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed11=Es geht doch nichts über die Schönheit der Natur. Giftige Blätter, spitze Dornen und diese lieblichen Würgeranken - daran kann ich mich gar nicht satt sehen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed12=Tja, wie das Leben so spielt ... oder eher, wie man IM Leben so spielt. Spiele sind toll: der Mensch gegen die Natur, Gut gegen Böse ... oder einfach nur Rot gegen Blau.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed13=Hey, den Namen Lunara hab ich mir nicht ausgesucht. Mein Vater hat mich nach meiner Großmutter benannt. Mein alter Herr lebt noch irgendwie in der Vergangenheit ...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed14=Ich hab schon ein paar ordentliche Böcke geschossen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed15=Die meisten Dryaden sprechen fließend Hirsch, Hase und Vogel, aber ich beherrsche zusätzlich noch Schlange, Bär und ein paar seltene Skorpiondialekte. <zischt> Tzzzz, tzzz. TZZZZ!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed16=Ich wette, Ihr wart noch nie auf einer Dryadenfeier! Wir kippen uns mehr Mondbeerensaft hinter die Binde als ein ganzer Dunkelmond-Jahrmarkt.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed17=<erklärend> Und so tollen wir herum: Hüpf und spring, hüpf und spring, hüpf und - nicht zu vergessen - spring.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed18=Ihr habt Eure eigene Umwelt ruiniert, meine werdet Ihr nicht ruinieren!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected00=Gut gemacht.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected01=Habt Dank. Es ist noch nicht vorbei.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive00=Ich währe ewig.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive01=Das Leben findet einen Weg.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive02=Mein Kampf geht weiter.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec00=Das sollte helfen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec01=Ah, das kann ich gebrauchen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec02=Perfekt.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec03=Ein Geschenk der Natur.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec04=Ich fühle mich bereits stärker.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt00=Was ist denn? Seid Ihr etwa allergisch? <lacht>
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt01=Vielleicht kennt Ihr die netten Dryaden. Ich gehöre nicht dazu.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt02=Ihr werdet großartigen Humus abgeben.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/TeamKilled00=Wir wachsen immer wieder nach!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExLocked00=Sehr Ihr etwas, das Euch gefällt, Sterblicher?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Freunde des Waldes sind immer willkommen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Gift00=Ihr verschenkt mich? Was bin ich? Ein Strauß Blumen?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Lockin00=Die Jagd ist eröffnet.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Purchase00=Die Natur möge Euch segnen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial00=Wenn's sein muss.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial01=Solange es nicht zu viel Zeit beansprucht ...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Ich sehne mich nach den Feldern Kalimdors ...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Die Wildnis ruft nach mir.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ich warte bereits zu lange.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hört endlich auf, mich anzustarren. Ich werde nichts Niedliches anstellen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used00=Ihr könnt der Natur nicht entkommen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used01=Leidet, wie die Wildnis gelitten hat!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used02=Bekämpfen wir die Wurzel des Übels!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate2Used00=Warum macht ihr nicht mal langsam?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate2Used01=Hüpfen und springen!

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Yes01=Ah, die weite, weite Welt.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Yes02=Für die Wildnis.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Yes03=Na schön.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Yes04=Die Natur geht ihren Weg.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Yes05=Ich suche die Feinde des Waldes.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Yes06=Wo werde ich gebraucht?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Yes07=Ich folge dem Ruf von Kalimdor ...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Yes08=Kräftig wachsen.

VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion_Muradin00=Bereit, den Lümmeln zu zeigen, wozu wir Zwerge in der Lage sind?
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Sieh mal einer an, ein Baby-Murloc. Was machst du denn hier?
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Hab Euch an der Backe, wie? Na großartig.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Seid gegrüßt!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Und dann sagt er: "Ist Falstad nicht tot?"
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroRespond00=Darauf hab ich schon den ganzen Tag gewartet!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroRespond01=Für eine Rauferei bin ich immer zu haben.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroRespond02=Warum nicht? Ich hab gerade nichts zu tun.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Angry00=Jetzt seid Ihr zu weit gegangen.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Indeed00=Hah, in der Tat!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Muradin00=Klingt nach Spaß. Ich bin dabei!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Murky00=So. Und da heißt es, ICH murmle in meinen Bart.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Negative00=Nehmt es mir nicht übel, aber Euch hänge ich lieber gleich ab.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Positive00=Worauf warten wir noch? Mischen wir sie auf!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Da ist mir doch mein Sturmhammer lieber.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Threat00=Das wird Euch noch leid tun.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Kill00=Oh ho! Das muss wehgetan haben!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Kill01=Bah! Zu einfach!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Kill02=So haben Tote auszusehen!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Kill03=Ihr müsst schon schneller sein ... und ein wenig mehr aushalten!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Kill04=Wer ist der Nächste?
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillAbathur00=Beim Barte meiner Oma, was war das?!
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillDeathwing00=Und deswegen nennt man mich Drachenjäger!
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillETC00=Ausgemuht!
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillMuradin00=Heh, Muradin ... hat Euch keiner beigebracht, wie man sich duckt?
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillSpreeEnd00=Uups, da hab ich wohl dazwischengefunkt.
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillThrall00=Sturmhammer eins. Schicksalshammer null.
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillTyrael00=Wo ist der Sinn von so lustigen Flügelchen, wenn Ihr sie nicht benutzen könnt?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowLifeHeal00=Vielen Dank. Das war knapp.
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowLifeHeal01=Bedank dich für die Heilung, Sturmschwinge. <Greifengeräusch>
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowLifeHeal02=Heh, echt gut, dass Ihr hier seid.
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowMana00=Ich habe nur noch wenig Mana.
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowMana01=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowMana02=Kein Mana mehr.
VoiceOver/Falstad/No00=Eh, das kann ich nicht tun.
VoiceOver/Falstad/No01=Eher nicht, Grünschnabel.
VoiceOver/Falstad/No02=Daraus wird nichts.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ping_AssistHero00=Helft unserem Verbündeten!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ping_AssistMe00=Ein klein wenig Hilfe wär nicht verkehrt.

VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed03=Macht Ihr doch eine Fassrolle!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed04=<Greif: Pupsgeräusch> Ach herrje, Sturmschwinge! Hast du wieder Ghul gefressen?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed05=<Greif: Magengeräusche> Achtung, da unten! Dem Greifen hier ist übel!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed06=Es ist immer schön, aus Eisenschmiede rauszukommen ... Keine Ahnung, wie es die Bronzebärte in der Höhle nur aushalten.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed07=Die Gerüchte über meinen Tod sind ziemlich übertrieben.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed08=Äähm, Ihr h-habt nicht zufällig einen kleinen Typen in einem roten Hemd gesehen, oder? Der beobachtet mich immer ...
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed09=Zu meiner Zeit war es noch eine wahre Herausforderung, einen Greifen zu reiten. Heute tun es sogar die Gnome!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed10=Willkommen an Bord von Wildhammer Air. Auf dem heutigen Flug zeigen wir Ihnen "Der Perfekte Sturmhammer".
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed11=Flugbegleiter! Mein Krug ist leer!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed12=<hustet> Immer diese verdammten Federn überall.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed13=Auch wenn gewisse Leute standhaft etwas anderes behaupten ... ich bin quietschlebendig und putzmunter!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed14=Es beeindruckt mich immer wieder, wie Sturmschwinge das macht ... Flap, flap, flap. Die ganze Zeit, ohne eine einzige Pause.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Resurrected00=Danke, das hat gut getan.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Resurrected01=Ho, das war knapp.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Revive00=Heh, ich hab überlebt!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Revive01=Versuchen wir das doch nochmal, Sturmschwinge.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Revive02=Weiter geht der Spaß!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Spec00=Jep!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Spec01=Oh ho ho!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Spec02=Was denkst du? <Greifengeräusche> Er findet's gut!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Spec03=Keine Einwände.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Spec04=Nicht übel.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Taunt00=Heh, Ihr da, wo wollt Ihr hin?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Taunt01=Kommt her! Sturmschwinge will Euch "Hallo!" sagen!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Taunt02=Auf meinem Sturmhammer steht Euer Name!

VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_Trial01=In Ordnung! Bin immer für eine Rauferei zu haben!
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_WaitLocked00=<Langes Gähnen> Geht's bald weiter?
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_WaitLocked01=Einen Moment. <Kratzt sich den Bart> Ahh, schon viel besser.
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_WaitPurchased00=<Räuspert sich> Wisst Ihr, wir könnten mittlerweile dort draußen sein und Schädel einschlagen.
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_WaitPurchased01=Sagt Bescheid, wenn wir uns ein bisschen Spaß gönnen wollen.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ultimate1Used00=Möge Euch der Blitz treffen!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ultimate1Used01=Zzzzap!

VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed01=Was geht?
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed02=Geld oder Liebe? GELD! Damit kann man Liebe kaufen.
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed03=Macht Euch keine Sorgen! Solange Ihr dieses Kabel mit dem Kontakthaken bei einer Geschwindigkeit von 140 in dem Moment, in dem der Blitz in den Generator einschlägt, berührt ... kann nichts mehr passieren ... <Stromschlag> <Lauter Knall> <Schreie>
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed04=Ich überlege mir gerade, ob ich mit der Hydraulikflüssigkeit aus der Servolenkung die Bremsflüssigkeit wieder auffüllen kann.

VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed09=Wisst Ihr, ich bin recht bescheiden. Ich mag Dinge wie X-plodium und Schießpulver und Treibstoff. Und wisst Ihr, was diese Dinge gemeinsam haben? Sie sind BILLIG!
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed10=Ich hab hier diese Kugelschreibermine und einen Kaugummi. <2. Stimme> Oh nein, der bastelt was, wir sind verloren.
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed11=Wisst Ihr, was das Tolle daran ist, der Chef von Ratschet zu sein? <Pause> ... ich wüsste es auch mal gerne ... <Pause> ... ganz ehrlich, man steht NUR blöd in der Gegend rum.
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed12=Guckt mal, was ich eingebaut hab ... <leiser zu sich selbst> Oben, oben, unten, unten, links, rechts, links, rechts, B, A. <wird wieder lauter> Uuuund los! (<ROBOTER:> "Goblinvernichtung aktiviert.") Äh, was? Das ist jetzt aber nicht gut.
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed13=Vergesst niemals Euren Bogenlichtschraubenschlüssel. Man weiß nie, wann man ihn braucht. <Pause> Das mein ich jetzt wirklich ernst.
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed14=Der entscheidende Punkt ist doch, dass die Gier gut ist. Die Gier ist richtig, die Gier funktioniert. Die Gier klärt die Dinge, durchdringt sie und ist der Kern jedes fortschrittlichen Geistes.
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Pissed15=Ich wär so gerne Millionär, dann wär mein Geldschrank niemals leer. Ich wär so gerne Millionär ... millionenschwer.

VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Taunt00=Kommt rüber! Dann verpass ich Euch 'n Ölwechsel ... durch die Nase.
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Taunt01=Nicht mal ich könnte eine Maschine bauen, die messen kann, wie blöd Ihr seid.
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/Taunt02=Ah, ein Feigling! Aber das muss ich Euch ja gar nicht sagen.
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/TeamKilled00=Oh Mann, so macht das keinen Spaß.
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/UI_ExLocked00=Hey, wie geht's, wie steht's?
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/UI_ExPurchased00=Alles klar. Was darf's denn sein?
VoiceOver/Gazlowe/UI_Gift00=Is' ja nich' mein Geld.

VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroKill02=Igitt, der zuckt ja noch. Eklig.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroKill03=Wow, bloß nicht zimperlich werden.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroKill04=Nicht vergessen, die Taschen zu durchsuchen. <Pause> Was denn?

VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelectPlayer01=Oh, you want me fighting and talking? Geeze. Alright, it's fine... but my fee just doubled.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelectPlayer02=Kommt Ihr Euch manchmal vor, als würdet Ihr Euch selbst zusehen? Nein? Ziemlich seltsam, glaubt mir.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSelect_Observer00=Sehr gut, beide Teams machen sich bereit. Oh. das dürfte gut werden.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain00=Ihr seid also tot. Das wird schon wieder.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain01=Was? Was hab ich verpasst? Ich hab woanders hingeguckt.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain02=Oooh, Ihr seid tot ... Darf Ich Eure Anlage haben?
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain03=Oh, ich wette das zwickt!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain04=Also, Ihr lauft jetzt einfach zurück zu Eurer Leiche und ... Ach du Himmel, sowas, weg ist sie ... Dann müsst Ihr wohl warten.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain05=Hey, wisst Ihr noch, als Ihr gestorben seid? Ach, das war ja grad erst. Vergesst es.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/HeroSlain06=Haha, Ihr hättet Euer Gesicht sehen sollen.

VoiceOver/GazloweA/Kill_Observer00=Held getötet.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/MegaKill00=Five in a row! Inconceivable!
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy00=Haha! Fort zerstört.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy01=Ooh, da wird einiges an Eigentum beschädigt.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy02=Schicke Explosion! Der geb ich eine ... 8.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy03=Oh, there goes a fort. That's so neat.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy04=So macht man das. Erste Sahne.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy_Blue00=Das blaue Team hat ein Fort zerstört.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostDestroy_Red00=Das rote Team hat ein Fort zerstört.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostLost00=Der Gegner hat ein Fort zerstört.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostLost01=Joa ... wir haben ein Fort verloren.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/OutpostLost02=Hey, ein Fort ist weg ... so'n Mist.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerAbandon00=Hey, da ist wohl einer abgehauen. Was ein Verlierer.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerAbandon01=Tja, einer der Helden wird jetzt ferngesteuert. Viel Spaß damit ...
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerAbandon02=<Emotionslos> Oh nein ... bitte geht nicht ...
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerRejoin00=Oh, hey. Ihr seid wieder da ... Was? Nein, ich hab nichts über Euch gesagt.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerRejoin01=Hey! Schaut mal, wer wieder da ist! Lag's am Router? Ich wette, es lag am Router ...
VoiceOver/GazloweA/PlayerRejoin02=Hah, hätte nicht gedacht, dass Ihr zurück kommt.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/Revive00=Ein Verbündeter wurde wiederbelebt.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/Revive_Observer00=Held wiederbelebt.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeEnd00=Blutrausch beendet. Finito.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeEnd01=Schade, das war's dann mit dem Blutrausch.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeEnd02=Der Blutrausch hat bestimmt Spaß gemacht. Schade, Schade.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeEnd_Ally00=Der Blutrausch unseres Teams wurde beendet.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeFirstUpgrade00=Chaos.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeMax00=Held des Sturms.

VoiceOver/GazloweA/SpreeThirdUpgrade00=Unaufhaltbar.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TalentUnlock00=Wählt ein Talent.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TalentUnlock01=Wählt ein Talent.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TalentUnlock02=Wählt ein Talent.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TeamKill00=Oh Mann. Das ganze gegnerische Team ist tot.
VoiceOver/GazloweA/TeamKill01=Oha, das ganze gegnerische Team wurde ausgelöscht.

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack00=Vergeudet keine Zeit, greift an!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack01=Das ist die Gelegenheit, greift an!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack02=Der Augenblick ist günstig, zum Angriff!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack_W00=Geht ihnen an die Gurgel!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack_W01=Zerfleischt sie!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Attack_W02=Zum Angriff, vorwärts!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Caution00=Seid wachsam, etwas stimmt hier nicht.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Caution_W00=Ich wittere Unheil.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob00=Beeindruckend!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob01=Vielleicht habe ich Euch unterschätzt.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob02=Ihr seid ein Verbündeter nach meinem Geschmack!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob_W00=Kurz und schmerzvoll!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob_W01=Das hatte Biss!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_GoodJob_W02=Mir gefällt Eure Wildheit!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Heal00=Begebt Euch zu einem Heilbrunnen. Tot seid Ihr niemandem von Nutzen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Heal01=Versorgt Eure Wunden!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Heal_W00=Geht Eure Wunden versorgen, schnell!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Heal_W01=Ihr benötigt Heilung!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Retreat00=Zieht Euch zurück hinter unsere Befestigungen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Retreat01=Wir müssen den Rückzug antreten!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Retreat_W00=Wir müssen uns zurückziehen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Retreat_W01=Verschwindet von hier!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh00=Wir haben einen Verbündeten verloren!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh01=Unsere Verbündeten fallen wie die Fliegen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh02=Rächt die Gefallenen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh_W00=Nein! Ein Mitstreiter ist gefallen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh_W01=<Growls> Dafür werden sie bluten!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/AI_Uhoh_W02=Ein Angriff auf mein Rudel ist ein Angriff auf mich!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack00=Für Gilneas!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack01=Ich werde Euch begraben!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack02=Euer Leben ist verwirkt!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack03=Es ist Zeit, zuzuschlagen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack04=Vergeltung naht!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack05=Gewährt ihnen keinen Millimeter!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack06=Der Sieg wird unser sein!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W00=Ihr seid als Nächstes dran!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W01=Ihr habt einen schweren Fehler begangen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W02=Diesmal halte ich mich nicht zurück!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W03=Gilneer weichen niemals zurück!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W04=Ich werde Euch begraben!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W05=Ich lechze nach Blut.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Attack_W06=Kein Entkommen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Celebrate00=Hah! Ausgezeichnet gekämpft!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Celebrate01=<Scoffs> Das nennt Ihr Befestigungen?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Comeback00=Wir gewinnen an Boden!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Comeback_W00=Unser Rudel kämpft vereint!

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed00=Ich stehe in Eurer Schuld.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed01=Eure Hilfe kommt keinen Augenblick zu früh, Heiler.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed02=Ich fühle, wie meine Kräfte zurückkehren.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed_W00=Ah, schon viel besser. Danke, Heiler.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed_W01=Erneut bereit für die Schlacht!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Healed_W02=Habt Dank, Heiler.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree00=Endlich eine Allianz nach meinem Geschmack.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree01=Eure Entschlossenheit ist beeindruckend.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroAgree02=Dieses Rudel verspricht eine erfolgreiche Jagd.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroBoast00=Unsere Feinde werden diesen Tag bereuen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroBoast01=Sei es durch die Schärfe meiner Klinge oder meiner Krallen, wir werden siegen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion00=Ich hoffe, Ihr seid bereit.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion01=Seid Ihr bereit für die Schlacht?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Ihr habt Euer Volk betrogen, Arthas. Es gibt kein schlimmeres Verbrechen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Baelog00=Ich würde bis aufs Blut für die Rückkehr in meine Heimat kämpfen und Ihr?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Erik00=Nichts wünsche ich mir mehr, als Gilneas wieder aufzubauen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Kael'thas00=Quel'Thalas ist kein Verbündeter von Gilneas. Doch es scheint, als müssten wir zusammenarbeiten.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Es gibt nichts, was ich mehr verabscheue, als einen untoten Monarchen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Lunara00=Habt keine Angst, Dryade. Ich bin mehr im Einklang mit der Natur als andere Menschen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=Ich nehme Hilfe nur ungern in Anspruch, Erzdruide. Dennoch danke ich Euch.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Wie ich höre, sieht Sturmwind Euresgleichen als Bedrohung an.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Bei Verbündeten wie Euch kämpfe ich lieber wieder allein.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Wenn ich schon Hilfe annehmen muss, so bin ich froh, dass sie von Euch kommt.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_RehgarSW00=(Outraged) Tragt Ihr da etwa einen Wolfspelz auf dem Kopf!?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Ihr glaubt, wir seien Verbündete? Wenn dies vorbei ist, werde ich Euch eigenhändig töten.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Wir mögen beide den Titel "König" tragen, doch ich führe das Rudel an!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond00=Ein wahrer Gilneer ist stets bereit.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond01=Ich habe viele Kriege gesehen – auch dieser wird nicht anders sein.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond02=Ihr werdet gleich erfahren, was geschieht, wenn man mich zu sehr reizt.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Ana00=Ihr werdet gleich erfahren, was geschieht, wenn man mich zu sehr reizt.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Strapaziert nicht meine Geduld!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Alles, was ich getan habe, tat ich für Gilneas. Doch Ihr habt lediglich Euch selbst gedient.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Baelog00=Schweigt, wenn Ihr nicht meine Zähne in Eurer Kehle spüren wollt.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Ich hatte auf verlässliche Verbündete gehofft. Stattdessen werde ich mit Euch Vorlieb nehmen müssen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Erik00=Ich bin ein WORGEN! W-O-R-G-E-N, Worgen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Kael'thas00=Mein Volk fiel dem Fluch der Worgen zum Opfer. Doch Ihr hättet das Eure beinahe in Dämonen verwandelt.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Meint Ihr die Fähigkeit, Euer Volk ins Verderben zu führen, oder das Talent, durch seine Hand zu sterben?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Lunara00=Ah, die Frau, die sich für ein Reh hält.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=Mein Volk verdankt Euch viel. Heute werde ich diese Schuld begleichen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ha! Kaum zu glauben, dass eine Kreatur wie Ihr so viel Chaos anrichten könnte.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Wenn es nach mir ginge, würden wir uns als Feinde gegenüberstehen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=Unsere Schicksale sind miteinander verknüpft.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ihr solltet wissen, dass Ihr einer der wenigen in dieser Runde seid, denen ich vertraue.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_RehgarSW00=(Condescending) Ah, Rehgar. Der Orc, der gerne ein Wolf wäre.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Und eines Tages wird Euer Volk das gleiche Schicksal ereilen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Ihr ahmt den Wolf nur nach. Ich hingegen WERDE zum Wolf.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill00=Fallt vor mir!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill01=Ihr hattet keine Chance.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill02=Sterbt wie ein Hund, Elender!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill03=Nun, wie schmeckt Euch gilnearische Gastfreundschaft?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill04=<Ahem> Wer ist der Nächste?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas00=Terenas, lasst dies meine Sühne sein.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas_W00=Ich habe getan, was Terenas nicht über sich brachte.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh00=Und nun kümmere ich mich um den Rest von Euch, Hordenpack!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh_W00=Nicht Lo'gosh ist der Wolf, den Ihr fürchten solltet.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKael'thas00=Kehrt zurück zu Eurem geliebten Sonnenbrunnen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKaelthas_W00=Ihr habt mir das Fell versengt!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric00=So möge es allen Königen ergehen, die ihres Thrones nicht würdig sind.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric_W00=Keine Sorge, Leoric. Ich werde Eure Knochen persönlich verscharren. (Snickers)
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara00=Vielleicht muss die Natur doch vor dem Menschen geschützt werden.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara_W00=Es scheint, als gewährte die Wildnis mir ihre Gunst.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion00=Es tut mir aufrichtig leid, Erzdruide. Doch es ging nicht anders.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion_W00=Vielleicht hattet Ihr Recht, Malfurion. Diese "Rudelgestalt" ist gefährlich.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Beinahe hättet Ihr mich so weit gehabt!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpree_W00=Ich bin der Alphawolf!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas00=Gerechtigkeit für Liam! Für alle Gilneer!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas_W00=Endlich vergieße ich Euer verdorbenes Blut!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther00=Ihr mögt ein Held der Allianz gewesen sein, doch Gilneas bedeutet ihr nichts.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther_W00=Irgendwie wusste ich immer, dass ich Euch überleben würde, Uther.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillVarian_W00=Was soll ich noch mal sagen?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W00=Das ist meine Beute!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W01=Ihr wart lediglich die Vorspeise.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W02=Leichte Beute.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W03=All dieses Töten macht mich hungrig!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W04=Ich bin der Beste in dem, was ich tue!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh00=<Hearty, good natured laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh01=<Derisive laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh02=<Vindictive laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh03=<Amused, but subdued laugh>

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh_W09=<Laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal00=Euch ist meine Dankbarkeit sicher, Heiler.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal01=Solange ich lebe, lebt auch Gilneas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ihr habt gute Dienste geleistet. Ich danke Euch, Heiler.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W00=<Gasps> Das war knapp. Ich danke Euch!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W01=Der Tod hatte mich bereits in seinen Fängen ...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W02=Ich verdanke Euch mein Leben, Heiler!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana00=Nicht genug Mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana01=Ich benötige mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana02=Ich habe nur noch wenig Mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W00=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W01=Mein Mana ist niedrig.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W02=Ich muss mein Mana auffrischen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No00=Niemals!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No01=Nein.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No02=Ausgeschlossen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W00=Das kann ich nicht tun.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W01=Unmöglich.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W02=Ich weigere mich.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Ein Verbündeter von uns braucht unsere Hilfe!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero_W00=Ein Mitglied unseres Rudels braucht Hilfe!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Steht mir bei!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Sammeln an meiner Position!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W00=Greift zusammen mit mir an!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W01=Lasst uns gemeinsam kämpfen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Bringt es zu Ende! Zerstört ihre Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle_W00=Gebt ihnen den Todesstoß! Zerstört die Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Nehmt dieses Lager ein und verstärkt unsere Reihen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc_W00=Zeigt diesen Söldnern, wo sie in der Nahrungskette stehen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Lasst uns das gegnerische Fort dem Erdboden gleichmachen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost_W00=Reißt dieses Fort nieder!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Nehmt diesen Beobachtungspunkt ein!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower_W00=Nehmt diesen Beobachtungspunkt ein!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unsere Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle_W00=Haltet sie von unserer Zitadelle fern!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Unser Fort darf nicht fallen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost_W00=Verteidigt unser Revier!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Lasst nicht zu, dass dieser Beobachtungspunkt dem Feind in die Hände fällt!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower_W00=Lasst nicht zu, dass sie unseren Beobachtungspunkt einnehmen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero00=Reißt diesen Gegner in Stücke!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero_W00=Frischfleisch!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed00=Ja? Raus mit der Sprache!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed01=Ihr werdet gefälligst das gebotene Zeremoniell einhalten, wenn Ihr mit mir sprecht!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed02=Wie ich gehört habe, sind zur Zeit ja Vampire überaus beliebt. Mir vollkommen schleierhaft wie diese zwielichtigen Taugenichtse so einen Erfolg haben können!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed03=Ich habe Narren wie Euch schon wegen geringerer Vergehen in Ketten legen lassen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed04=Einst ließ ich einen unüberwindlichen Wall errichten, um mein Volk vor den Gefahren der Außenwelt zu schützen. Ihr erinnert mich daran, warum.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed05=Wenn wir Gilneas zurückerobert haben, werden wir es wiederaufbauen müssen. Ich frage mich, ob diese Gesellen von der Bruderschaft der Defias noch verfügbar sind ...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed06=Hm? Natürlich dient dieses Schwert lediglich offiziellen Anlässen. Ich trage eine Muskete bei mir, Dummkopf!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed07=Die gilnearische Flagge sollte eigentlich ein Wolfskopf zieren, aber meine Advokaten hatten Einwände wegen möglichen Urheberrechtsverletzungen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed08=Der Graumähnenwall schützte uns zuverlässig vor dem Einfluss der Außenwelt. Schließlich gibt es in Azeroth keine Möglichkeit, hohe Hindernisse fliegend zu überwinden oder sich zu einem bekannten Zielort zu teleportieren.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed09=Diese Waffe ist Wertarbeit aus Gilneas. Ihre Wirkung kann man in jeder Hinsicht als "durchschlagend" beschreiben.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed10=Wart Ihr jemals in Burg Schattenfang? In meiner Jugend verbrachte ich viel Zeit dort, doch in letzter Zeit wechseln die Hausherren ziemlich häufig.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed11=Gilneas war mehr als zwanzig Jahre lang vom Rest der Welt vollkommen abgeschottet. Ich hoffe, Ihr werdet es mir nachsehen, wenn ich nicht jede kulturelle Anspielung von Euch Jungspunden verstehe.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed12=Vollmond? Heute Nacht? Oh nein, ich werde mich in ein Ungeheuer verwandeln! Ha ha! Ich mache nur Spaß. Ich könnte jederzeit, wenn mir danach ist, in meine Worgengestalt wechseln und Euch die Kehle herausreißen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed13=Vor einiger Zeit verirrte sich eine junge Verlassene, die auf dem Weg zu ihrer untoten Großmutter war, vor unser nördliches Tor und rief: "Ei Graumähne, was habt Ihr so große Mauern?" Ich entgegnete: "Damit ich Dich besser mit kochendem Teer übergießen kann!" Ach, Ihr hättet sehen sollen, wie diese kleine Rotzgöre gelaufen ist!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed14=Wusstet Ihr übrigens, dass der Graumähnenwall zu den wenigen Bauwerken gehört, die vom Wirbelnden Nether aus sichtbar sind? Nein, ehrlich, ich spreche die Wahrheit.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W00=Was wollt Ihr?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W01=Sprecht.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W02=<Menacing growl>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W03=Fragt bloß nicht, was mit meinem Schwert passiert, wenn ich mich verwandle. Ich meine es ernst.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W04=Ihr wollt mir also weismachen, dass diese "Tauren" eine Art humanoide Rindviecher sind? Kuhmenschen sozusagen? Also das ist einfach lächerlich!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W05=Die Nachtelfen waren die ersten, die sich in Worgen verwandelten. Mal wieder typisch, bei allem müssen sie die ersten sein.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W06=Tief im Schwarzforst versammeln wir Worgen uns unter einem riesigen Baum, der unsere animalische Natur besänftigt. Es ist ein friedliches Plätzchen, nur riecht es dort ein wenig streng.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W07=Ihr denkt wohl, Hunde, die bellen, beißen nicht. Dann solltet Ihr eines wissen: Worgen sind keine Hunde.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W08=Ich warne Euch, wenn Ihr damit nicht aufhört, drehe ich Euch durch den Wolf!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W09=Dieser Anzug ist übrigens aus Wolle. Tja, ich denke, das macht mich zu einem Wolf im Schafspelz.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W10=<Grunts> Diese verdammten Flöhe! Oh, richtig, Ihr seid das ja.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W11=Wollt Ihr wohl damit aufhören? Da wird ja der Wolf in der Pfanne verrückt!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W12=Unter uns: Ich bin eigentlich eher ein Katzenfreund.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W13=Man wirft mir immer wieder vor, ein gar zu strenger Herrscher zu sein. Nun, ich gebe zu: Ich halte mein Volk eher an der kurzen Leine.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W14=Als Herrscher von Gilneas hatte ich so manche schwere Entscheidung zu ... <schreit unvermittelt> Katze! <nach kurzer Zeit> Oh, entschuldigt, wo waren wir stehengeblieben?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected00=Allein die Starken überleben!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected01=Ihr steht in meiner Gunst, Heiler.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive00=Gilneas wird überleben!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive01=Ich habe schon Schlimmeres überstanden.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive02=Ich werde mein Volk nicht noch einmal enttäuschen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec00=Natürlich.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec01=Eine würdige Wahl.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec02=Der Fluch wird stärker ...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec03=Eines Königs Waffe ist seine Überzeugung.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec04=Der einsame Wolf.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W00=Gute Wahl.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W01=Da läuft mir das Wasser im Maul zusammen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W02=Selbst ein alter Wolf lernt niemals aus.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W03=Meine Sinne sind geschärft.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W04=Ich höre Goldrinn heulen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt00=Ihr seid mir nicht ebenbürtig!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt01=Ich erschieße Euch wie einen tollwütigen Hund!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt02=Ihr wagt es, Euch dem König von Gilneas zu widersetzen?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W00=Ich kann Eure Angst riechen.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W01=Nur ein Narr fordert den Alphawolf heraus!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W02=Lauf, kleines Mädchen, lauf!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/TeamKilled00=Lasst sie die Wut unseres Rudels spüren!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExLocked00=Mein Zorn wird meine Feinde vernichten!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExLocked_W00=Mein Zorn ist entfesselt!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Dieser Fluch wird meine mächtigste Waffe sein.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExPurchased_W00=Dieser Fluch ist meine Waffe.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Gift00=Früher hielt ich nicht viel von Nächstenliebe, doch nun sehe ich einen gewissen Nutzen darin.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Gift_W00=Ein Geschenk? Interessant.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Lockin00=Gilneas wird wiederauferstehen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Purchase00=Ich bin der Anführer des Rudels!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Purchase_W00=Ich bin der Anführer des Rudels!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Trial00=Ich brauche ein wenig Auslauf, lasst uns ein paar Runden drehen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Trial01=Ihr habt Zweifel an meiner Stärke? Dann werde ich Euch gerne eine kleine Vorführung geben.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Gilneas stand jahrelang unter Belagerung. Ich bin bereit zum Kampf!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Zögern ist ein Zeichen von Schwäche.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked_W00=Beeilt Euch, mich erwartet die Schlacht.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked_W01=Zögern ist ein Zeichen von Schwäche.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ein wahrer Anführer zieht stets als Erster in die Schlacht.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ein Wolf, der sich langweilt, ist ein gefährlicher Gefährte.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased_W00=Ein wahrer Anführer zieht an der Spitze seiner Streitkräfte als Erster in die Schlacht.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased_W01=Ein Wolf, der sich langweilt, ist ein gefährlicher Gefährte.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used00=Ihr könnt Euch nicht vor mir verstecken!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used01=Blut geleckt!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used02=Nun seid Ihr die Beute!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used00=Mein Zorn ist entfesselt!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used01=Ich reiße Euch in Stücke!

VoiceOver/Illidan/Ping_KillHero00=Dieser Held muss sterben.
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed00=Ich werde ungeduldig.
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed01=Wer wagt es, mich zu berühren?
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed02=Ich bin blind, nicht taub.
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed03=<SMS-Geräusch> Einen Moment, die Dunkelheit hat mir gerade eine SMS geschickt.
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed04=Vermisst sonst noch jemand Chaosschaden?
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed05="Hast du das gesehen?" Nein, habe ich nicht. Wie oft denn noch?
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed06=Einst waren Flügel, Hufe und Hörner ein seltener Anblick in der Welt von Warcraft. Ach ja, die gute alte Zeit.

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_Retreat01=Zieht Euch zurück!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_Transport00=Lasst uns das transportieren.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_Transport01=Wir sollten das jetzt fortschaffen.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Es wird Zeit, das abzugeben.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Zurück zum Abgabeort.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed00=Wie lautet der Plan?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed01=Psst! Ich versuche zu denken.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed02=Ich wollte immer nur studieren. Natürlich hat dann ein gigantischer Dämon mein Zuhause in Schutt und Asche gelegt ... Da war's mit dem Studieren erst mal vorbei.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed03=Hmm, ob meine Teleportzauber hier funktionieren? Wie ging das noch gleich ... ah, ja: Eene meene Drachenhort, bring mich fort von diesem Ort. Hex-hex! ... Oh nein, da muss ich wohl was verwechselt haben.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed04=Vergesst, was ich vorhin gesagt habe ... JETZT wird es echt unheimlich. Vorhin ist ein Zwerg aus Marzipan an mir vorbeimarschiert!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed05=Moment mal, ist das ein weißes Haar? Hoffentlich ist das kein schlechtes Omen.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed06=Es ist wirklich schön, wieder mal draußen zu sein. Ich fühle mich, als hätte ich jahrelang in einem Turm festgesessen.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed07=Ich habe noch nie verstanden, warum Magier von Schafen so fasziniert sind.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed08=Eine Zauberin kommt nie zu spät, ebenso wenig zu früh. Sie trifft genau dann ein, wann sie es beabsichtigt!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed09=Die Ströme der Magie sind voller Turbulenzen.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed10=Lasst Euch verzaubern von meinem Geheimnis, das Mana bringt die Kraft, das Abenteuer lacht.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed11=Nur, damit das mal klar ist: Das hier sind keine Zaubertricks. Es sind Illusionen. Zaubertricks sind das, wofür man in den Schlotternächten Bonbons kriegt.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed12=Wie bitte? Thrall und ich? Uääh... wer verbreitet immer wieder dieses widerwärtige Gerücht? (kurze Pause) Jeder weiß, dass ich auf blau stehe! Nicht auf grün.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed13=Außerdem wollten meine beiden letzten Verehrer die Weltherrschaft an sich reißen. Wie gesagt, ich will lieber nur studieren ...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed14=Ich habe gesehen, dass die Horde und die Allianz in Frieden zusammenleben können. Ein einziges Ereignis könnte uns zusammenbringen.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed15=Eure ständigen Anspielungen auf die Eiskönigin finde ich völlig unverfroren.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed16=Als mein Bruder Derek getötet wurde, schwor mein Vater, alle Orcs auf Azeroth auszulöschen. Ich frage mich, wie ich mit einem solchen Verlust umgehen würde. Ich hoffe, dass ich es nie erfahren muss.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed_Evo00=Was ... ist der Plan?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed_Evo01=Versuche zu denken ...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Resurrected00=Vielen Dank dafür.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Resurrected01=Ich bin froh, dass Ihr mir den Rücken freihaltet!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd00=Rache wird am besten kalt serviert.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd01=Vielleicht hört Ihr ja nächstes Mal auf die Stimme der Vernunft.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeEnd02=Nun, das wäre erledigt.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart00=Ihr geht mir auf die Nerven.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart01=Ihr fallt als Nächstes.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/RevengeStart02=Ich verabscheue es, Gewalt anzuwenden. Aber für Euch mache ich eine Ausnahme.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive00=Um mich unterzukriegen, müsst Ihr Euch schon mehr anstrengen.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive01=Beeilung, unsere Verbündeten brauchen uns.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Revive02=So, versuchen wir das noch einmal.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Dance00=Na, hab ich Euch schon in meinen Bann gezogen?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Dance01=Oh, dieser Tanz gefällt mir viel besser.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Goodbye00=Das Licht sei mit Euch.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Goodbye01=Passt auf Euch auf.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Hello00=Hallo.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Hello01=Wie geht's?

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_Thanks01=Habt Dank.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_WellPlayed00=Ein ausgezeichneter Schachzug.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Gut gemacht.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec00=Ich weiß auch schon, wie ich das verwenden werde.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec01=Gute Wahl.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec02=Das wird das Blatt wenden.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec03=Dieser Plan gefällt mir.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Spec04=Interessant.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt00=Was ist los? Fürchtet Ihr Euch vor mir?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt01=Meine Magie wird Euch in Stücke reißen!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt02=Wo wollt Ihr denn hin?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt_Evo00=Fürchtet Ihr Euch?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt_Evo01=Magie wird... Euch zerreißen!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Taunt_Evo02=Wo wollt Ihr hin?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/TeamKilled00=Gebt nicht auf! Wir müssen siegen!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_ExLocked00=Für die Allianz!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ich grüße Euch.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_Gift00=Meine Talente werden scheinbar anderswo gebraucht.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_Lockin00=Ich bin hier, um zu helfen.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_Purchase00=Meinen Zauberkünsten reicht niemand das Wasser.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_Trial00=Gerne stelle ich mich dieser Herausforderung.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_Trial01=Ich kann Euch sicherlich ein paar Tricks zeigen.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Ich versichere Euch, Ihr findet in ganz Azeroth keinen besseren Magier.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Fragt einfach, wenn Ihr meine Hilfe benötigt.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Falls Ihr ja sowieso nichts macht, kann ich in der Zwischenzeit ja ein Buch lesen.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hallo? Ist da noch jemand?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ultimate1Used00=Verteidigt mich, Elementar!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ultimate1Used01=Eure Zeit ist gekommen, Freund.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Ultimate1Used02=Erhebt Euch, Diener Neptulons!

VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Bringen wir es hinter uns.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Dieses Bündnis wird sich zweifellos als hilfreich erweisen.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Mm. Gebt Acht ... Wenn Ihr weiterhin so viel Unsinn redet, könnte Euch die Zunge abfallen.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Kill00=Ihr habt gespielt. Und verloren.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Kill01=Ist das alles, was Ihr zu bieten habt?
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Kill02=Das war ein Kinderspiel.

VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/KillStitches00=Gah, zumindest musste ich es nicht anfassen, um es zu töten.

VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed01=Mein Volk muss gerächt werden.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed02=Der letzte Rückschlag war nur ein Rückschlag! <kurze Pause> <Räuspern> Wer beim Sonnenbrunnen hat sich diesen Unsinn mit den RÜCKschlägen eigentlich ausgedacht? Kleiner VORschlag: Der Nächste, der einen Rückschlag erwähnt, <zornig> bekommt einen Satz heiße Ohren!
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed03=Diese Rüstung schützt nicht im Geringsten vor Hitze. Hier drin ist es höllisch heiß!
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed04=Zuerst hat die Allianz mein Volk im Stich gelassen, danach taten die Illidari dasselbe. Doch das ist jetzt belanglos – mein Volk muss gerächt werden.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed05=Nun, dies is 'ne Story, in der's darum geht, von heut' auf morgen wurd' mein Leben verdreht. Also gib mir 'ne Sekunde und mach dich nicht nass, dann erzähl ich dir was vom Prinzen der Stadt Bel'Thalas!
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed06=<im Singsang> Mana Mana, düü düüü bidübi ...
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed07=Das ist Euer Gehirn. Sag hallo, Gehirn. (zweite, leicht dümmere Stimme: Hallo!) Und das ist Euer Gehirn auf Teufelsmagie. <SFX: fire effect> (zweite Stimme schreit) Noch Fragen?
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed08=He, passt auf, wo Ihr hinklickt! Für diese Frisur habe ich zwei Stunden vor dem Spiegel verbracht.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed09=Sie haben Lor'themar zum Waldläufergeneral ernannt? Ernsthaft? Was kommt als Nächstes? Sollen sich vielleicht die Blutelfen der Horde anschließen?
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed10=Ihr seht diese grünen Kugeln auch? Ah, gut. Ich dachte schon, ich halluziniere.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed11=<disgusted exertion> An den Geruch verbrannter Haare werde ich mich nie gewöhnen.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed12=<gereizt> Haltet doch mal kurz die Klappe und wartet einen Moment ... ich hab Entzug. <SFX: Sound of demonic energy being siphoned> Ahh, viel besser.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed13=Blut für die Blutelfen, Sonne für den Sonnenkönig!
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Pissed14=Energie. Kraft. Mein Volk ist süchtig danach ... Wisst Ihr was, diese Rede habe ich schon tausendmal gehalten. Schaut sie Euch doch einfach im Internet an.

VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Revive00=Wurde ja langsam Zeit.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Revive01=Nur ein Rückschlag.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Revive02=Hmm. Ich werde sie kein weiteres Mal unterschätzen.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Spec00=Das sollte für den Moment ausreichen.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Spec01=Wie berauschend.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Spec02=Eine treffliche Ergänzung für mein Arsenal.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Spec03=Eine weise Entscheidung.

VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/WorthIt00=Ein gerechter Tausch.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/WorthIt01=Das war es in jeder Hinsicht wert.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Yes00=Es soll geschehen.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Yes01=Außerordentlich.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Yes02=Die Sonne erleuchtet meinen Pfad.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Yes03=Ist mir ein Vergnügen.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Yes04=Sehr gut.
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Yes05=Endo-enah, Quel'Thalas!
VoiceOver/KaelthasBase/Yes06=In der Tat.

VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroAgree01=Klingt spaßig.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroAgree02=Auf geht's.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroBoast00=Diese Welt wird sich uns unterwerfen.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroBoast01=Meine Rache steht bevor.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroQuestion00=Gleich geht es zur Sache. Seid ihr bereit?
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroQuestion01=Seid ihr bereit? Mir wird langweilig.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroQuestion_Abathur00=Abathur.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroQuestion_Artanis00=Artanis ...
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroQuestion_Dehaka00=Wir machen das wie beim Psi-Zerstörer: aufteilen und erobern.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroQuestion_InfestedTychus00=Weißt du, wer ich bin? Gut. Dann folge deiner Königin.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Süß. Und wo bleibt mein echter Verbündeter?
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Du schon wieder.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroQuestion_Nova00=Willst du mal einem Profi bei der Arbeit zusehen?

VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Mir doch egal.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Excited00=Ich kann's nicht abwarten.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_InfestedTychus00=Nein, für MICH!
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Kidding00=<DO NOT RECORD. REUSES AN INTRO LINE.>
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Murky00=Für einen solchen Knirps spüre ich erstaunlich viel Hass in dir.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Negative00=Weiß du, ich würde es echt bedauern, wenn du mir im Weg stündest.

VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Positive00=Reißen wir sie in Stücke.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Raynor00=Weißt du doch.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Right00=Sicher.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Tassadar00=Mindestens 15 Jahre ...
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Tychus00=Keine Sorge, früher oder später bist du auf dich allein gestellt.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Zagara00=Weißt du noch, was ich dich über Weitsicht gelehrt habe? Zeit, es umzusetzen.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Zeratul00=Lass deine Klinge für dich sprechen, Zeratul.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Für den Schwarm.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Kill00=Du solltest die Königin nicht verärgern!
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Kill01=Och, hat das weh getan? Gut!
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Kill02=Stirbst du? Lass dich nicht aufhalten.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Kill03=Viel Lärm um nichts.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Kill04=<hust> Leichter als gedacht.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillAbathur00=Genug gespielt. Zurück an die Arbeit!
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillArthas00=Immer diese verwöhnten Prinzen ...
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillKerrigan00=Es kann nur eine geben.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillLeoric00=Schlafenszeit, Leoric.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillNova00=Netter Versuch, Blondie. Du bist und bleibst einfach die Nummer 2.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillProtoss00=Protoss ... Große Klappe, nichts dahinter.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillRaynor00=Warst DU es nicht, der MICH umbringen wollte, Jim?
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillSpreeEnd00=Und deshalb bin ich die Königin.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillSylvanas00=Lang lebe die echte Königin.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillTerran00=Hüte dich vor der Königin der Klingen.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillZeratul00=Du hattest niemals eine Chance, Zeratul.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/KillZerg00=Stell dich niemals gegen deine Königin!

VoiceOver/Kerrigan/LowLifeHeal01=Guter Einsatz.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/LowLifeHeal02=Gut gemacht! Jetzt bin ich bereit für die zweite Runde.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/LowMana00=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/LowMana01=Mein Mana geht zur Neige.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/LowMana02=Ich brauche mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/No00=Meinst du das ernst?
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/No01=Unmöglich.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/No02=Das kann ich nicht tun.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Ping_AssistHero00=Helft unserem Verbündeten.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich könnte etwas Hilfe gebrauchen.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Ping_AssistMe01=Hilf mir mal jemand!

VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed00=Was willst du?
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed01=Sprich.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed02=Ich mag dich. Und deswegen werde ich dich als Letzten töten.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed03=Es ist nicht einfach, die Königin zu sein.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed04=Ja, ich bin noch immer die Königin der Zicken.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed05=Was glotzt du mir so auf den Vorbau?
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed06=Noch immer so leicht zu begeistern, wie ich sehe.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed07=Diese Energydrinks verleihen anscheinend tatsächlich Flügel.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed08=Moment, sollte ich jetzt nicht wieder ein Mensch sein? Was denn nun, Blizzard. Mensch, Zerg, Mensch, Zerg. Entscheidet euch mal.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed09=Das Schlimmste daran, Schwarmgedanken zu haben, ist, dass man jederzeit genau weiß, wie viele Zerglinge sich gerade lecken.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed10=Und welcher evolutionäre Vorteil steckt bitte hinter der Entwicklung solcher Absätze?
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed11=Wenn andere Frauen sagen, sie hätte einen Schwarm, dann meinen sie garantiert nicht das Gleiche wie ich.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed12=Es dauert ewig, sich das Haar zu kämmen, wenn es aktiv dagegen ankämpft.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed13=Komm, wir werfen Steine aufs Berstlingnest.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed14=Unglaubliche Psi-Kräfte ... eklig-schleimiges Zuhause.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed15=Sie werden assimiliert werden. Ihre biologischen und technologischen Eigenschaften werden den unseren hinzugefügt. Widerstand ist zwecklos.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed16=Oh, das alles und noch viel mehr würd ich machen, wenn ich Königin der Klingen wär.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Resurrected00=Guter Einsatz.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Resurrected01=Ich bin wieder da.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Revive00=Der Schwarm lebt ewig.

VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Spec02=Ich fühle mich stärker.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Spec03=Ich liebe es!
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Spec04=Hört sich spaßig an.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Taunt00=Was ist los? Hast du Angst?
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Taunt01=Komm ruhig näher, ich beiße nicht. Dafür hab ich Zerglinge.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Taunt02=Stell dich mir! Feigling!
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/TeamKilled00=Das lässt noch zu wünschen übrig. Wir müssen uns weiterentwickeln.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/UI_ExLocked00=Ich bin der Schwarm.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/UI_ExPurchased00=Deine Königin hört dir zu.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/UI_Gift00=Ich werde allen Feinden den Tod bringen.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/UI_Lockin00=Wart's ab, bis sie es mit mir zu tun bekommen.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/UI_Purchase00=Perfekt.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/UI_Trial00=Ich freu mich drauf.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/UI_Trial01=Eine Demonstration meiner Macht? Wie amüsant.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/UI_WaitLocked00=Na los, lass uns etwas zerstören.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/UI_WaitLocked01=Wenn ich nur rumstehen und nichts tun wollte, wäre ich auf meinem Leviathan geblieben.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/UI_WaitPurchased00=Komm schon, ich hab Lust, die Welt in Stücke zu reißen.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed03=Immer noch ein einfaches Gemüt, was?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed04=Ich bin heilfroh, dass sich Jim mir im Kampf gegen Mengsk angeschlossen hat. Was würde ich nur ohne ihn machen?

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed06=Ist schon eine Weile her, dass ich einen Ghost-Schutzanzug getragen habe. Seit wann haben die denn diese leuchtenden Streifen?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed07=Ich hatte nie viel für Valerian übrig, aber eines muss ich zugeben: Seine Laborratten haben da ein paar hübsche Spielzeuge gebastelt. Erinnert mich daran, diesem "Reigel"-Typen noch mal zu danken.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed08=Wenn sie sich schon so viel Mühe mit meinen Schwingen gegeben haben, hätten sie dem Anzug wenigstens auch ein Tarngerät einbauen können, oder?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed09=Seid ihr auch froh, dass die Ghosts jetzt "Ghosts" heißen und nicht mehr "Geister", so wie früher einmal? Ich schon, nur macht das das Übersetzen einiger Witze etwas komplizierter.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed10=Es ist schon schön, wieder ein Mensch zu sein. Aber ihr wisst echt nicht, was ihr wollt, oder Blizzard? Immer dieses Hin- und Her. Was macht ihr als Nächstes aus mir? Eine Xel'Naga? <lacht> Stellt euch das nur mal vor ...

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed12=Ja, natürlich ist ein robotischer Ultralisk komplett verrückt ... aber habt ihr gesehen, wie cool der aussieht?
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed13=Hm, viellllllleicht sollte ich mal mein Shampoo wechseln ...
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Pissed14=ICH BIN DER SCHWARM! Oh, tut mir leid. Es ist nicht leicht die kombinierten Gedanken einer ganzen außerirdischen Spezies aus dem Kopf zu bekommen ... ENTWICKELN! ÜBERLEBEN! ... Oh Mann. Das könnte eine Weile dauern.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Resurrected00=Ich lebe? Danke ... ganz ehrlich.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Resurrected01=Okay, ich bin wieder dabei.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Revive00=Oha, das hat weh getan. Das machen wir lieber nicht noch mal.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/Revive01=Es gibt keine Zeit zu verlieren.

VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_WaitLocked01=Ich warte auf dich.
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_WaitPurchased00=Man sollte doch annehmen, dass hautenge Schutzanzüge auch warmhalten, aber ... <brrrr>
VoiceOver/KerriganGhost/UI_WaitPurchased01=So langsam wird es mir hier etwas langweilig.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed00=Ihr wagt es ...?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed01=Wer stört die Ruhe des Königs von Khanduras?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed02=Ich bin bereits tot. Was geschieht also, wenn ich getötet werde? Bin ich ... toter? Supertot? ... oder lebendig?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed03=Es ist kein Kinderspiel, eine Familie, ein Königreich und die Seele eines der Großen Übel unter einen Hut zu bringen.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed04=Dieses Gesindel nannte mich wahnnsinnig, paranoid! <Entrüstetes Keuchen> Ist es etwa paranoid zu denken, dass Euch jeder nach dem Leben trachtet? Hm? SPRECHT! ... ist es das? Und was, wenn sie es doch wirklich tun ...?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed05=Diese alten Knochen fürchten nur eines: Osteoporose!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed06=Vernimmt sonst noch jemand dieses Flüstern? Was? Nein ... Ja! <verrückte böse Lache> Oh ja, bald hören sie es ALLE.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed07=Ihr da! Nehmt Eure Hand weg! Wisst ihr, wie leicht das abfällt?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed08=Ich bin der Skelettkönig, nicht der König der Skelette – ein großer Unterschied.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed09=Helden? <Entrüstetes Keuchen> Ihr meint diese Herumtreiber, die andauernd in meine Hallen einbrechen, meine Sammlung exotischer Vasen demolieren und meinen, mich erwecken zu müssen – nur um mir die Knochen zu brechen und überall auf dem Boden weiße Gegenstände herumliegen zu lassen? Oh ja, wie unglaublich "heroisch".
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed10=<missmutig> Habt Ihr auch so steife Knochen? Mir scheint, es regnet bald.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed11=Die Dunkelheit folgt mir ... Ich folge ihr auch, aber sie macht selten Posts.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed12=Sitzen zwei Skelette auf einer Mauer, eins fällt herunter, beide sind tot ...
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed13=Habt Ihr das auch schon erlebt? Ich schlafe friedlich in meiner Gruft und plötzlich landet so ein peitschenschwingender Lederhutträger auf mir und versucht mir meine Krone zu stehlen. <Seufz> Ich hasse Touristen.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed14=Trinkt mehr Milch. <Unheimliches Lachen> Das ist gut für die Knochen.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Resurrected00=Wer ruft mich in die Welt der Lebenden?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Resurrected01=Meine ewige Ruhe wird warten müssen.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive00=Mein Grab hält mich nicht!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive01=Meine Herrschaft wird ewig währen!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive02=Man kann nicht töten, was nicht richtig lebt.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec00=Ja. Wahrlich eines Königs würdig.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec01=Bei meinem Geburtsrecht!

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec03=Eine vorzügliche Wahl.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec04=Gut. Sehr gerissen.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Taunt00=Flieht oder sterbt!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Taunt01=Schwört mir Eure Lehnstreue!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Taunt02=Bringt mir Euren Kopf, damit ich ihn einschlagen kann.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/TeamKilled00=<widerwillig> Wir müssen zusammenstehen, um dieses Gesindel bezwingen zu können.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_ExLocked00=Der Skelettkönig ruft Euch!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ich warte ...
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Gift00=Ich hoffe, mein neuer Besitzer ist meiner würdig ... um seinetwillen.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Lockin00=Sie werden alle leiden!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Purchase00=Eine Entscheidung von großer Weitsicht.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Trial00=Eine überraschend gute Entscheidung, Wicht.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Trial01=Nun endlich kann ich Rache üben.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Ihr wärt ein Narr, meinen Zorn zu unterschätzen.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Ich muss aus diesem Fegefeuer befreit werden!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Unsere Feinde sind auf dem Vormarsch, wir sollten keine Zeit verlieren.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Schneller, oder Euer Kopf wird rollen.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ultimate1Used00=Das wird Euer Grab sein!

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Attack00=Zerquetscht sie. Lasst nicht ab.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Attack01=Überwältigt sie und ihr Widerstand wird gebrochen sein.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Attack02=Zerfetzt sie. Unserem Zorn sind sie nicht gewachsen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Caution00=Gebt gut Acht. Jetzt zu sterben würde euch nicht bekommen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_GoodJob00=Simpel, aber effektiv.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_GoodJob01=Du hast dich gut angestellt.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_GoodJob02=Ein weiterer Gegner liegt im Staub.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Heal00=Heile dich! Für Verwundete habe ich keine Verwendung.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Heal01=Kümmer dich um deine Wunden, bevor sie dein Ende sind.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Retreat00=Wartet nicht auf mich.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Retreat01=Es wird Zeit für einen Strategiewechsel.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Uhoh00=Enttäusche mich nie wieder.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Uhoh01=Ich habe keine Verwendung für nutzlose Diener.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Uhoh02=Ich dulde kein Versagen!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack00=Für das Ewige Imperium.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack01=Du besitzt Stärke. Ich werde dich unterwerfen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack02=Keine Gnade. Keine Vergebung.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack03=Alle Verräter müssen ausgerottet werden.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack04=Aller Widerstand wird gebrochen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack05=Spürt meinen Hass!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack06=Sterbt durch meine Hand.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Celebrate00=Ausgezeichnet.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Celebrate01=Genau wie geplant.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Comeback00=Wir schließen zu ihnen auf. Bedient euch ihrer Schwächen.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Healed00=Gut gemacht. Ergebenheit wird belohnt werden.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Healed01=Eine nützliche Fertigkeit. Du darfst fortfahren.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Healed02=Gut so. Bleib mir treu ergeben, Heiler.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree00=Und Gnade dir, wenn nicht ...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree01=Dein Zorn wird sich als mächtiger Verbündeter erweisen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree02=Diesmal wird uns niemand aufhalten.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroBoast00=Ich habe tausend Welten unterworfen. Dieser wird es nicht anders ergehen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroBoast01=Die Macht der Dunkelheit wird ihnen ein Ende bereiten.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion00=Ich hoffe, du bist auf den bevorstehenden Krieg vorbereitet.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion01=Bist du bereit?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Ich spüre, dass du noch mit der Kontrolle über die Dunkelheit ringst. Du bist ihrer nicht würdig.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Ich spüre Dunkelheit in dir, Dämon. Schwach, aber genug, um mir zu dienen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Interessant. Du stehst vor einem Herrn der Dunkelheit, aber du erzitterst nicht ...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Hm, in dir prallen Dunkelheit und Licht aufeinander ... Niemand kann auf lange Sicht zwei Herren dienen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Ein Wesen vollkommener Dunkelheit. Diene dem Ewigen Imperium und du darfst leben.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Deine Macht wird dem Ewigen Imperium dienen, Dämon. Füge dich, sonst werden wir dich zwingen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Monk00=Ich spüre in dir nur Stille, Menschling. Warum hat dich der Tod noch nicht ereilt?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Der Hass brodelt in dir. Schließ dich mir an und du wirst die Rache bekommen, nach der es dich dürstet.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Spar es dir. Dies wäre nicht die erste Welt, die ich alleine unterwerfe ...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Ich glaube, du könntest mir dienlich sein. Hoffen wir beide, dass ich Recht behalte.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Eine Kreatur des Lichts ... das Ewige Imperium ist bereits auf Wesen wie dich getroffen. Sie waren köstlich ...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond00=Ich finde deinen Mangel an Glauben beklagenswert.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond01=Die Frage ist doch: Bist du es?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond02=Kümmer dich um deine eigenen Angelegenheiten.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Ana00=Du wirst mir noch nutzen, also sehe ich über diese Anmaßung hinweg ... vorerst.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Ah, ein König, der meint, er herrsche über die Toten ... Ich sehe vieles, das dagegen spricht.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Das wirst du gleich herausfinden.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Diesen Namen habe ich schon seit Ewigkeiten ... Sprich ihn nie wieder aus, sonst wirst du es bereuen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Du lebst nur, weil ich es erlaube. Lass mich meine Großzügigkeit nicht bereuen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Demon00=Du wirst mir noch nutzen, also sehe ich über diese Anmaßung hinweg ... vorerst.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Dein Ton erinnert mich an viele, die nicht mehr unter uns weilen. Du solltest ihn überdenken.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Monk00=Ich bin nicht der, für den du mich hältst, Menschling. Sei froh, dass du mich nicht kennst.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Murky00=Wenn das dein Wunsch ist, werde ich deinem Zorn nicht im Weg stehen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Negative00=Schweig.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Positive00=Genug der Förmlichkeiten ... Es gibt viel zu tun.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Ja, Lichtwesen ... gib dich der Angst hin, damit dich die Dunkelheit verschlingen kann.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill00=Viel zu leicht.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill01=Dir fehlt die Überzeugung.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill02=Das Imperium duldet keine Verräter.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill03=Unbedeutend.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill04=Betrachte dich als erledigt.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillArthas00=Der Tod umgibt dich, doch du bist nicht sein Meister.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillAzmodan00=Warum begehrst du auf, Dämon? Unsere Ziele sind dieselben.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillBarbarian00=Wie wäre es mit einer Rüstung?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillButcher00=Solche Wut ... Solcher Hass. Du wirst mir dienen, Bestie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillCrusader00=Schweigen ist Gold, Kreuzritter.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDemonHunter00=Für dich ist Dunkelheit eine Waffe, ich wurde in ihr geboren.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDiablo00=Das Ewige Imperium könnte deine Macht gebrauchen, Diablo. Schließ dich mir an.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillMonk00=Bete zu so vielen Göttern, wie du willst. Sie können dich nicht vor mir retten.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillSpreeEnd00=Selbst eure Besten reichen mir nicht das Wasser.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillTyrael00=Interessant. Ein Engel? Oder nur ein Lichtwesen, das sich als einer ausgibt?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillUther00=Alle, die auf das Licht vertrauen, werden genau wie es ausgelöscht werden.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWitchDoctor00=Du spielst mit Mächten, die du nicht begreifen kannst.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWizard00=Du ... bist nicht die Prinzessin. Und doch bereitet mir dein Tod Freude.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal01=Ah, mein Tod wurde hinausgezögert.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal02=Dieses Mal war es recht knapp.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana00=Mir fehlt das Mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana01=Nein. Dazu fehlt mir das Mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana02=Ich benötige Mana.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No00=Ein Ding der Unmöglichkeit.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No01=Zwing mich nicht, dir weh zu tun. 
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No02=Niemals.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter versagt.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe00=An meine Seite.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe01=Zu mir! Schnell!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackCastle00=Die Zitadelle. Eliminiert sie!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackMerc00="Überredet" diese Söldner, sich uns anzuschließen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Stampft ihre Verteidigung ein.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackTower00=Dieser Beobachtungspunkt wäre höchst nützlich.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unsere Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Dieses Fort DARF nicht fallen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendTower00=Verteidigt diesen Beobachtungspunkt.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_KillHero00=Zeigt diesem Helden die Macht der Dunkelheit.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed00=Was kann ich gegen dich tun?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed01=Du stellst meine Geduld auf die Probe. Das ist nicht ratsam.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed02=Das Ewige Imperium hat viele Welten verschlungen. Ihre Macht ist durch die Dunkelheit an mich gefesselt.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed03=Unter meinem wachsamen Blick haben wir alle unsere Feinde zerquetscht. Alle ... na ja ... bis auf einen kleinen Planeten voller widerspenstiger Sternenprinzessinnen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed04=Und-ich-sing ... heeeeeeeeeeey Space-Lord, Mother-mother.  [ALT] Komm zur Dunkelheit. Wir haben Kekse. [ALT2] Ich bin dein Vater. Und dein Vater. Und dein Vater. Und dein Vater bin ich auch.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed05=Wir haben eine Abmachung. Nein, warte, ich habe noch eine kleine Änderung. Ah, viel besser. Oh, diesen Teil sollte ich auch noch etwas ändern ... <böse>Ja ... JA!</böse> Diese Abmachung gefällt mir immer besser.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed06=Unterschätzt niemals die Macht der Dunkelheit. Ich meine es ernst. Die Dunkelheit ist dann echt sauer und hinterlässt überall so passiv-aggressive Klebezettel ... ü-ber-all!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed07=Falls ihr jemals eine unpraktische und phänomenal große Superwaffe baut, dann lasst den Architekten nicht als gestalterische Entscheidung irgendwelche 2-Meter-großen Löcher einbauen. Wenn man da rein feuert, kann das ganze Ding in die Luft fliegen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed08=Es gibt immer zwei Spacelords. Ein Meister und ein Schüler. <pause> Das macht unsere Treffen irgendwie öde ... und einseitig.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed09=Ja, die Macht der Dunkelheit sieht aus wie ein leuchtender Hologrammeffekt. Gibt es daran etwas auszusetzen?  [ALT] <peinlich/bloßgestellt>Sie wissen doch, ich trinke IMMER Kaffee, wenn ich den Radarschirm betrachte.</peinlich/boßgestellt> <Befehlston>Das wissen ALLE hier!</Befehlston>
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed10=<Knurren> Das blöde Visier beschlägt ständig. <SFX: Squeegee sounds> Ah, viel besser.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed11=Einige behaupten, der Name "Ewiges Imperium" wäre vermessen. ... Sekunde, einige behaupTETEN. Ja, besser. Man sollte die richtige Zeitform verwenden, wenn man sich auf Tote bezieht.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed12=Nein, diese funkelnden Lichter dienen keinem wirklichen Zweck. Aber ich sehe das so, wenn man sich schon in einen robotischen Körper einbaut, dann bitte schön mit Stil.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed13=Nein, du Trottel, wir nehmen das nicht zu wörtlich. Wir sollen die Wüste durchkämmen, also durchkämmen wir sie.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed14=Ihr habt ja keine Ahnung, wie viele Doppel-A-Batterien ich pro Woche verbrauche.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed15=Niemand erzählt einem jemals, wie absolut langweilig der Weltraum ist. Er ist riesig, größtenteils vollkommen leer und die paar Flecken, die das nicht sind, sind für gewöhnlich voller Idioten.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected00=Ewiger Dienst. Endlose Treue.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected01=Gut gemacht, Diener des Imperiums.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive00=Der Kreis schließt sich.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive01=Ich währe ewig, so wie unser Imperium ewig währt.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive02=Ah ... fahren wir mit der Inquisition fort.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive03=Dachtet ihr, ihr wärt mich los?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive04=Ich sterbe nicht. Ich lebe nicht.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec00=Die Dunkelheit wird stärker.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec01=Unsere Feinde werden leiden.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec02=Wie passend.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec03=Weniger hatte ich nicht erwartet.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec04=Gut, das kann ich gebrauchen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt00=Du bedeutungsloser Wicht.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt01=Komm und stell dich deinem Schicksal.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt02=Ich werde mich höchstpersönlich um dich kümmern.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/TeamKilled00=Neeeeeiiin!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExLocked00=Du störst mich hoffentlich nicht ohne triftigen Grund.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExPurchased00=Eine Präsenz, die ich lange nicht mehr ... [ALT] Diesmal wird uns niemand aufhalten!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Gift00=Wie du wünschst.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Lockin00=Diese Galaxie wird leiden.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Purchase00=Ruhm dem Ewigen Imperium.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial00=Ah, eine neue Welt, die es zu unterwerfen gilt.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial01=Du wünschst eine Demonstration meiner Macht? So sei es.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked00=Schließ dich mir an und gemeinsam könnten wir über die Galaxis herrschen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked01=Meine Geduld hat ihre Grenzen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased00=Auch wenn du das Warten leid bist, bleibe ich immer noch unbeeindruckt.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased01=So viele Sterne ... Und alle werden sie irgendwann dienen.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used00=Niemand entkommt seinem Schicksal.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used01=Jetzt hab ich dich.

VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed06=Also ... Ich wurde auf dem Rücken einer Riesenschildkröte geboren, die so durch den Ozean schwimmt ... Aber was, wenn der Ozean einfach nur so der Rücken einer noch viel größeren Schildkröte wäre? Und ... <aufgeregt> Oh du meine Güte! Und wenn es dann noch mehr Schildkröten gäbe ... eine größer als die nächste? <schnauft, da sie ganz überdreht war>
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed07=<Seufz> Das ist sooooo langweilig. Los, machen wir irgendwas!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed08=Fragt sich hier sonst noch jemand, wo diese ganzen komischen Diener herkommen? Von denen erfährt man nichts, die reden ja nicht mal ... Hallo? Jemand da?

VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed10=<Seufz> Ihr macht mich zu einem seeeehr traurigen Panda.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed11=Das Leben ist ein Abenteuer! Außer, wenn es das nicht ist ... Tja, dann weiß ich wohl auch nicht, was es ist ... aber es ist irgendwas! Ja, genau! Das Leben ist irgendwas!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed12=Äh ... Hey, sollten wir nicht kämpfen? Ich hab ja gegen das Gerede nichts einzuwenden, aber unsere Teamkollegen warten auf uns, wisst Ihr?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed13=Wisst Ihr ... Habt Ihr je darüber nachgedacht, ein wenig vor die Tür zu gehen und die Welt zu erkunden? Sie ist riiieesig!

VoiceOver/LostVikingsBase/Pissed02=ERIK: Alles klar, Jungs? OLAF: Ich hab schrecklichen Hunger. BALEOG: Das fällt dir etwas spät ein. Außerdem hast du heute schon dreimal gegessen! OLAF: Seht ihr! Das ist kein Wunder, dass ich hungrig bin.
VoiceOver/LostVikingsBase/Pissed03=ERIK: Siebzehn Jahre lang nichts, und dann holen sie uns für ein MOBA wieder raus! War ja klar. BALEOG: Es ist ein Teamkampfspiel, kein MOBA. OLAF: Das stimmt nicht. Das hast du gerade erfunden. ERIK: Ich nicht ... aber Blizzard sehr wohl! BALEOG: Irgendwann werfen sie uns wegen euch raus ...
VoiceOver/LostVikingsBase/Pissed04=BALEOG: Wenn du so weitermachst, dann pikse ich zurück! ERIK: Baleog! Beruhige dich. Tief durchatmen. Du gehst gleich in die Luft! BALEOG: <atmet> ERIK: Gut, gut so.

VoiceOver/LostVikingsBase/Pissed09=BALEOG: Hier macht ja nie einer was ... weckt mich, wenn's weitergeht. ERIK: Nein, warte! BALEOG: <Schnarchen> ERIK: Uuund weg ist er. Gut, wie bewegen wir uns denn jetzt?
VoiceOver/LostVikingsBase/Pissed10=ERIK: Uuh! Ich glaube, ich brauche wieder mal ein Bad. BALEOG: Ein Bad? Wikinger brauchen keine Bäder! Bäder stinken! OLAF: Genau! Außerdem habe ich erst letztes Jahr gebadet.
VoiceOver/LostVikingsBase/Pissed11=OLAF: Vielleicht bekommen wir so endlich unsere eigene Fernsehserie? Ich mag Kochshows total! ERIK: Der Kochprofi – Einsatz mit Bauch. Jeden Dienstagabend auf Silicon & Synapse TV. BALEOG: Na danke, bei dem Format werden wir schon nach 'ner halben Staffel wieder für 17 Jahre abgesetzt.
VoiceOver/LostVikingsBase/Pissed12=OLAF: So. Nur, damit das klar ist: Ich kriege immer noch Eriks Helm. BALEOG: Und ich seine Stiefel. ERIK: Siebzehn Jahre! Nichts ändert sich.
VoiceOver/LostVikingsBase/Pissed13=OLAF: Wisst ihr noch, als wir in World of Warcraft waren? ERIK: Das war doch nur 'ne Anspielung. BALEOG: Ja, wir sind keine Zwerge, wir sind Wikinger! Außer Erik. Der ist 'n Zwerg. ERIK: He! Nimm das zurück!

VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowLifeHeal02=Hui, das war knapp. Gute Arbeit.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowMana00=Ich hab kaum noch Mana.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowMana01=Meine Manareservern werden knapp.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowMana02=Ich brauche mehr Mana.

VoiceOver/MedicBase/MatchEnd02=<Reuses a previous line of dialog. Do not record.>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/No00=Negativ.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/No01=Wir wissen doch beide, dass das nicht geht.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/No02=Ähm, nö.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Los, helfen wir unserem Freund.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Das schaff ich nicht allein.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Hey, ich brauche Verstärkung.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zielt auf die Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Sezieren wir ein Söldnerlager.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Dieses Fort sollte ein gutes Ziel abgeben.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Wir sollten uns diesen Beobachtungspunkt aneignen.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt die Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Oh, oh, unser Fort ist in Schwierigkeiten.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt beschützen, bevor er flöten geht.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_KillHero00=Seht ihr diesen Helden? Schalten wir ihn aus.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed00=Wo tut's denn weh?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed01=Nennen Sie die Art des medizinischen Notfalls.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed02=Ich bin dem VED beigetreten, um das Universum zu einem sichereren Ort für meine Familie zu machen. Aber ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich mal hier enden würde.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed03=Wenn ich an die Erde denke, merke ich, wie sehr ich alles vermisse. Selbst die Krabbelviecher. Die sind zuhause einfach so viel kleiner.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed04=Oh-oh, werde ich etwa angestupst? Dann muss ich jetzt schnell was Lustiges sagen ... ähm, äh ... Ach Mist, ich bin Arzt und kein Komiker.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed05=Wenn mich jemand fragt, sage ich immer: Heilen ist gar nicht so schwer. Das ist wie töten ... nur rückwärts.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed06=Alle haben es immer zuerst auf den Sani abgesehen. Deshalb haben wir auch diese riesigen, regenerativen Schilde.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed07=Wobei, gilt das nicht als Kriegsverbrechen, Sanitäter abzuknallen? Gelten die Genfer Konventionen eigentlich im Nexus?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed08=Nachdem ihr erst einmal einen frisch geschlüpften Overmind mit Neurostimulanzen vollgepumpt habt, ist alles andere ein Kinderspiel ... glaubt mir.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed09=Wenn mir noch so ein Gehirnamputierter diesen dämlichen <verstellte Stimme>"Kommt 'ne Frau beim Arzt"</verstellte Stimme>-Witz erzählt, isst er seine Mahlzeiten künftig durch einen SCHLAUCH.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed10=Ich hasse Spritzen. Jedenfalls bei mir. Bei anderen Leuten macht es jedoch eine Menge Spaß. <kicher>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed11=Niemals den Sanitäter-Eid vergessen: Verletze niemanden, versorge die Verwundeten. Und falls das nicht hilft, wirf Granaten.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed12=Space-Marines haben ein ziemlich großes Maul. Die verbreiten so viele Gerüchte. Zum Beispiel, dass ich offene Wunden mit einem Tacker schließe. So ein Blödsinn! Dafür habe ich eine Heißklebepistole. Heftklammern sind doch teuer.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed13=Also diese neue Ausrüstung gefällt mir eigentlich ganz gut ... Moment mal! Hab ich gar keine Blendgranaten mehr?! ... Ein normaler Granatwerfer ist ja schön und gut, aber Leuten das Augenlicht zu nehmen wird mir echt fehlen.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed14=Oh, ein Beipackzettel. <liest>Dieser Heilstrahl wurde nicht vom Gesundheitsministerium genehmigt. Unter und nach Einfluss dieses Strahls ist es untersagt, Fahrzeuge, schwere Maschinen oder mystische Kreaturen zu steuern.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed15=<liest weiter>Zu den Nebenwirkungen zählen Übelkeit, Dimensionsverlagerung, Magenbeschwerden und übernatürliche Ausflüsse. Konsultieren Sie einen Arzt, bevor sie diesen Heilstrahl verwenden.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed16=Ach du meine Güte ... vielleicht richte ich das Ding besser nur auf ANDERE.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Resurrected00=Hui, für 'ne Sekunde hab ich da schon ein helles Licht gesehen.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Resurrected01=Danke. Wüsste nicht, was ich ohne dich tun würde.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive00=Puls konstant. Atmung stabil.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive01=Der Doktor ist da.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive02=Gut, dann wollen wir mal wieder an die Front.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec00=Upgrade abgeschlossen.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec01=Oho, neue Instrumente! Na endlich.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec02=Damit kann ich arbeiten.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec03=10 von 10 Ärzten empfehlen das.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec04=Hui, das gefällt mir.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt00=Oh, bei dir ist wohl eine Operation schiefgegangen.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt01=Ihr glaubt, ihr hättet eine Chance gegen uns? Ha!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt02=Herzchen, ich hab schon härtere Soldaten als dich in meinem OP zersägt.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/TeamKilled00=Reißt euch zusammen und lasst uns den Spieß umdrehen.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_ExLocked00=Nennen Sie die Art des medizinischen Notfalls.

VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Lockin00=Lasst mich durch, ich bin Arzt.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Purchase00=Retten wir ein paar Leben.

VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Ich wär dann so weit, Commander.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Es kann jederzeit losgehen.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Uff, der Schild ist schwer. Können wir vielleicht mal loslegen?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Jede Minute sterben im Schnitt 100 Menschen. Vielleicht sollten wir nicht so rumtrödeln.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used00=Nanostimulatoren aktiviert.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used01=Hier, das sollte helfen.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used02=Du könntest jetzt ein leichtes Kribbeln spüren.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used03=Verabreiche Stimpack.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used04=Stimpack aktiviert.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used00=Den letzen beißen die Zerglinge.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used01=Transporter bereit. Alle Mann an Bord.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Unerheblich! Wir werden sie besiegen.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Schweigen ... ist Gold.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Hmpf.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=Die Götter des Hains sind sonderbare Geschöpfe.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Der Tod steht Euch weit besser.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ihr sprecht wie ein sprudelnder Strom. Wie erfrischend.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Meine Gedanken gehören Wichtigerem als Euch.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_No00=Genug dieser Torheiten.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Diese Welt ruft nach Kriegern wie uns.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Kill00=Recht plump.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Kill01=Eure Technik lässt zu wünschen übrig.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Kill02=Euer Weg endet hier.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Kill03=Bedauernswert.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Kill04=Euer Bestes war wenig überzeugend.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillAzmodan00=Schweigt, Dämon!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillButcher00=Zurück in den Schlund der Hölle, Monster!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillChen00=Ihr seid kein wahrer Mönch.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillD3Hero00=Auch unsere Liebsten können der Verderbnis anheimfallen.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillDiablo00=Dieses Übel kann in dieser Welt nicht von Dauer sein.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillLeoric00=Ich hoffe Euer Aufenthalt im Grab ist dieses Mal ... dauerhaft.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Hier endet Euer Weg.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/KillTyrael00=Ich klage, Freund, doch Ihr habt das Gleichgewicht gestört.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowLifeHeal00=Meine Kraft kehrt wieder.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowLifeHeal01=Meine Wunden schließen sich.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowLifeHeal02=Habt Dank, Heiler.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowMana00=Mein Mana verblasst.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowMana01=Ich benötige mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowMana02=Mein Mana geht zuneige.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/No00=Das ist nicht möglich.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/No01=Ihr verlangt das Unmögliche.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/No02=Überdenkt Euer Vorhaben.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Dort, ein Verbündeter braucht uns.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich kann nicht alleine standhalten!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Leiht mir Eure Stärke!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Bringt Tod und Zerstörung über die Zitadelle unseres Gegners!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten dieses Söldnerlager einnehmen.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Erschüttert dieses Fort in seinen Grundfesten.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Dieser Turm muss weichen.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Unsere Zitadelle ist in Gefahr. Beschützt sie!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Schützt unser Fort.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Schnell. Verteidigt diesen Turm!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_KillHero00=Dieser Held muss sterben. Das Schicksal will es so.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed00=Und wohin führt Euch Euer Pfad?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed01=Ich diene den Patriarchen von Ivgorod, den Auserwählten von tausendundeins Göttern.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed02=Ich glaubte nicht, dass mein Pfad mich hierher führen würde, doch er tut was er will.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed03=Jede Handlung muss der Meditation entspringen. So liegt Weisheit in Eurem Tun ... theoretisch.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed04=Bei meinen vielen Reisen und Begegnungen habe ich eines gelernt. Weisheit ist ein rares Juwel, das sich vor den Menschen zu verbergen weiß.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed05=Einst reiste ich mit einem Krieger von Lügen getrieben, einer Göttin mit Zweifeln an ihrer Art und einem weisen Uralten, der nur Torheiten zum Besten gab.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed06=Meinen ersten Atemzug tat ich unter dem Zeichen von Ytar, dem Gott der Sonne. Seine Tracht ist es, die ich trage, und seine Lehre ist es, der ich folge.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed07=Ich bin dankbar, unter dem Zeichen von Ytar geboren zu sein. Es gibt andere Götter - Götter des Müßiggangs und des Gleichmuts. Viele dienen ihnen nur allzu gut.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed08=Wenn ihr es denn wissen müsst – ja, ich habe Haar, doch meine Glatze ist ein Zeichen der Gottesfurcht.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed09=Meine Faust fuhr durch zahllose Bretter und mein Körper erduldete Tage des Fastens, doch die Tätowierungen in meinem Gesicht brennen noch immer am meisten. 
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed10=Mein Herz wankt nicht. Mein Geist trübt nicht. Mein Mantra ... ändert sich nicht.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed11=Wenn Ihr die Explodierende Hand einsetzt, denkt immer daran ... Eure Hand sollte nicht wirklich explodieren.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed12=Leert Euren Geist. Seid ohne Form, ohne Gestalt – wie Feuer. Legt man Feuer in einem Becher, brennt es durch den Becher – und dann den Tisch, und dann das Haus. Seid Feuer, mein Freund – nicht der Becher.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed13=Ah, ein Diener Sovyats, des Gottes der endlosen Nervtöterei. Ihr seid wahrlich eine Zierde seiner Lehren.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed14=Um euch würdig zu erweisen, müsst ihr Shenlong bezwingen. Er ist seit etwa einem Jahrtausend tot. Viel Erfolg!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed15=Ich hörte von einem rundlichen Wesen mit schwarz-weißem Fell, das mit seinem kleinen Finger ein ganzes Dorf auszulöschen vermochte. Ich glaube, sie nannten es den "Ulki-" oder "Juxi-Fingergriff".
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected00=Ihr seid die Hand der Götter.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected01=Mein Freund, unser Werk ist noch nicht getan.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive00=Die Götter gebieten mir, mein Werk zu vollenden!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive01=Meine Zeit ist noch nicht gekommen.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive02=Einmal mehr diene ich.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec00=Ich bin nun reicher an Erkenntnis.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec01=Mein Pfad festigt sich.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec02=Die Götter gewähren mir ihre Gunst.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec03=Ytar erhebt mich ins Unendliche.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec04=Mein Geist wird stärker.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt00=Wollt Ihr Euch unbedingt selbst zerstören?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt01=Stellt Euch mir und Ihr werdet untergehen.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt02=Eure Schwäche widert die Götter an.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/TeamKilled00=Dies ist nur eine Prüfung und wir werden sie bestehen.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExLocked00=Ich bin die Faust der Götter.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ich werde das Gleichgewicht erhalten.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Gift00=Es scheint, meine Dienste sind andernorts gefragt.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Lockin00=Ytar, leite meinen Pfad.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Purchase00=Die Götter schenkten Euch Weisheit.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial00=Eine Prüfung? Hervorragend.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial01=Ah, lasst die Unterweisung beginnen.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Diejenigen, die nichts unternehmen, werden zu nichts.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Die Zeit bleibt immer in Bewegung. Das sollte ich auch.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Wer nicht wagt, der nicht gewinnt.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Die Götter belohnen nicht jene, die untätig bleiben.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used00=Die Götter handeln durch mich!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used01=Spürt den Zorn des Ytar!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate2Used00=Tausendundein Segen begleiten Euch.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate2Used01=Die Götter gewähren Euch Stärke.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes02=Für Ivgorod.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes03=Ich begrüße jede Prüfung.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes04=Die Schlacht steht bevor.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes05=Ich freue mich auf eine erneute Prüfung.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes06=Mein Geist ist klar.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes07=Die Götter sind in allem und jedem.

VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Attack00=Auf sie, solange sie geschwächt sind!
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Attack01=Jetzt haben wir sie! Macht keine Gefangenen!
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Attack02=Attacke!
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Caution00=Seid vorsichtig dort draußen.
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_GoodJob00=Ausgezeichnete Arbeit!
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_GoodJob01=Gut gekämpft!
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_GoodJob02=Denen habt Ihr's gezeigt!
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Heal00=Ihr seht aus wie ich nach einer langen Nacht. Sucht Euch einen Heilbrunnen.
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Heal01=Hab noch nie jemand gesehen, der einen Heilbrunnen so dringend nötig hatte wie Ihr.
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Retreat00=Höchste Zeit, in die entgegengesetzte Richtung vorzurücken.
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Retreat01=Ich muss mich zurückziehen!
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Uhoh00=Das könnte uns teuer zu stehen kommen.
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Uhoh01=Oh oh, schlechtes Timing.
VoiceOver/Muradin/AI_Uhoh02=Oh oh.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Attack00=Ich nehm den Hässlichen!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Attack01=Für die Bronzebärte!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Attack02=Nehmt das, Bastard!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Attack03=Jetzt wird der Hammer geschwungen!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Attack04=Versucht doch, mich aufzuhalten.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Attack05=Für Khaz Modan!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Attack06=Schaut genau hin!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Celebrate00=So macht man das!

VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroAgree00=Fangt nicht ohne mich an!
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroAgree01=Ich bin dabei!
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroAgree02=Auf jeden Fall.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroBoast00=Auf geht's! Zeigen wir ihnen, wo der Hammer hängt.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroBoast01=Macht ihnen allen den Garaus!
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion00=Bereit, ein paar Schädel einzuschlagen?
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion01=Gleich geht's rund! Ich hoffe, Ihr seid vorbereitet.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Bleibt mir bloß weg mit dem Schwert.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Falstad00=Ich wette zweitausend Gold, dass ich mehr Gegner umniete als Ihr.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Brr, ich hasse diese Viecher ...
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Kann gar nicht glauben, dass ich an Eurer Seite kämpfe.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Sieh mal einer an, wer auch da ist!
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroQuestion_Viking00=Hab ich Euch nicht schon mal im Ödland gesehen?
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroRespond00=Packen wir's an!
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroRespond01=Oh, yeah.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroRespond02=Ich bin bereit zur Welt gekommen.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Agree00=Was soll ich noch mal sagen?
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Ich konnte Euch nicht helfen ... und das bereue ich zutiefst.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Falstad00=Verdammt richtig!
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Murky00=<disgusted exertion> Bei diesem Geräusch stellen sich bei mir immer noch alle Haare auf.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Negative00=Beeilt Euch, bevor ich vergesse, auf welcher Seite Ihr seid.
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Positive00=Los, schlagen wir ein paar Schädel ein!
VoiceOver/Muradin/IntroResponse_Viking00=Weshalb nennt man Euch die "Vikings", wenn ich hier derjenige mit Hörnern am Helm bin?
VoiceOver/Muradin/Kill00=Ich hab schon Blutelfen getroffen, die zäher waren als Ihr!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Kill01=Seid zukünftig lieber doppelt wachsam.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Kill02=Merkt Euch das für's nächste Mal.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Kill03=Grüßt Eure Vorfahren von mir!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Kill04=Mann, das macht Spaß!
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillArthas00=Das war dafür, dass Ihr mich zurückgelassen habt!
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillDemonHunter00=Und IHR jagt Dämonen? <Spöttisches Lachen>
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillFalstad00=Oh ... Hügelzwerge ... Große Klappe, kleine Hämmer.
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillRaynor00=Macht schon Platz, ich bin der Landvogt!
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillSpreeEnd00=Und mir hat man gesagt, Ihr hättet was drauf ...
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillTassadar00=Tassadar hat, äh, eindeutig versagt.
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillThrall00=Dreckige Horde.
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillTinker00=Scheint, als ob der Schrotthaufen eine Überholung benötigt. <lacht>
VoiceOver/Muradin/KillTychus00=Hmm, hätte gedacht, Ihr könntet mehr einstecken.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowLifeHeal00=Das war dringend nötig.
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowLifeHeal01=Wirklich gut, dass Ihr auf unserer Seite seid!
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowLifeHeal02=Das war ziemlich knapp. Danke!
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowMana00=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowMana01=Hmm, gleich kein Mana mehr.
VoiceOver/Muradin/LowMana02=Ich könnte ein wenig Mana gebrauchen.
VoiceOver/Muradin/No00=Eher nicht.
VoiceOver/Muradin/No01=Das ist nicht möglich.
VoiceOver/Muradin/No02=Das kann ich nicht tun.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AssistHero00=Helft unserem Verbündeten!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich könnte ein wenig Hilfe gebrauchen!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AssistMe01=Könnte hier noch eine weitere Axt gebrauchen!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AttackCastle00=Jemand Lust, die gegnerische Zitadelle auseinanderzunehmen?
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten dieses Söldnerlager einnehmen.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Machen wir dieses Fort platt!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_AttackTower00=Dieser Beobachtungspunkt will geradezu erobert werden.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt die Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Schnell, sichert unser Fort!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir sollten auf diesen Beobachtungspunkt Acht geben.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ping_KillHero00=Schlagt diesem Helden den Schädel ein!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed00=Ich bin ganz Ohr.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed01=Ich grüße Euch!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed02=Schwerter für 300, bitte.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed03=Was? Ich war gar nicht tot! Ich hab nur kurz meine Augen geschlossen.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed04=Lasst mir meinen Frieden oder Ihr werdet bald in Frieden ruhen, Freundchen.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed05=Oh, Ihr wollt wissen, wie es ist, an Amnesie zu leiden? Kein Problem, ich sag's Euch. Es ist ... hmm, also ... ich hab's vergessen.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed06=Kann mir irgendwer Gold leihen? Ich bin ein wenig zu kurz gekommen. Hallo? Hört mich irgendwer?
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed07=Man wirft keine Zwerge! <Pause> Man SCHLEUDERT sie! Ein kleiner, aber feiner Unterschied.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed08=Hmm, nichts mehr zu trinken. Wartet mal kurz. <wringing sound and cup filling> Ha! Ich wusste doch, dass der Bart zu etwas zu gebrauchen ist!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed09=<summt ein paar Takte aus "In der Halle des Bergkönigs" von Edvard Grieg>
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed10=Wagt es bloß nicht, mich in den Garten zu stellen!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed11=<flüstert> Man munkelt, dass mein Großvater in Wirklichkeit ein ... ein Silberbart war. <seufzt> Hat sich seinen Bart das ganze Leben lang gefärbt! Aber psst!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed12=Blizzard hat Euren Lieblingscharakter abgemurkst? Ach, seid unbesorgt. In ein oder zwei Erweiterungen ist er wieder da. Glaubt mir – ich weiß, wovon ich spreche.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed13=Wisst Ihr, ist 'ne tragische Geschichte und so, aber mein Bruder Magni gibt eine großartige Statue ab! Funkelt so schön.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed14=Als Brann noch ein kleiner Zwergling war, haben wir ihn oft dabei ertappt, wie er in der Zeitschrift der Forscherliga geblättert hat ... Hehehe. Er hat immer behauptet, er liest nur die Artikel, aber wir wussten alle, dass es ihm eigentlich um die Bilder von den Tuskarrfrauen ging. <laughter>
VoiceOver/Muradin/Resurrected00=Danke, dass Ihr aufpasst!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Resurrected01=Hui, auf einmal war's ganz schnell vorbei.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Revive00=Bart, Blut, Bauch und Donner!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Revive01=Für Khaz Modan!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Revive02=Auf wen stürze ich mich als Nächstes?
VoiceOver/Muradin/Spec00=Sehr gut.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Spec01=Unbedingt.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Spec02=Eine gute Wahl.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Spec03=Darüber hatte ich auch schon nachgedacht.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Spec04=Damit zeig ich's der Welt!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Taunt00=Oh, kommt schon her! Ich will Euch meinem Hammer vorstellen!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Taunt01=Kommt und kämpft gegen einen richtigen Zwerg!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Taunt02=Kommt rüber, damit ich Euch die Zähne einschlagen kann!
VoiceOver/Muradin/TeamKilled00=Pause? Na gut, wenn's unbedingt sein muss ...
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_ExLocked00=Was kann ich für Euch tun?
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_ExPurchased00=Freut mich, Euch kennenzulernen!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_Gift00=<gespielt pikiert, nicht wirklich verärgert> Ich weiß schon, wenn ich nicht erwünscht bin!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_Lockin00=Bereit für den Kampf!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_Purchase00=Legen wir los!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_Trial00=Ha! Das gefällt mir schon besser!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_Trial01=Kann's kaum erwarten.
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_WaitLocked00=Von mir aus können wir ja ein paar Köpfe einschlagen.
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_WaitLocked01=Heh, klickt doch mal da unten auf "Ausprobieren". Ihr werdet nicht enttäuscht!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_WaitPurchased00=Also, ich weiß ja, dass ich furchtbar schön anzuschauen bin, aber ich würde jetzt wirklich gern kämpfen!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ich bin ein Zwerg der Tat, kein Zwerg des Rumstehens.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ultimate1Used00=Khaz Modan!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ultimate2Used00=Haut ab!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ultimate2Used01=Ha-ha! So geht das!

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill00=Nur eine weitere Leiche.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill01=Seht dem Tod ins Auge.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill02=Zweifelt nie an meinen Fähigkeiten.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill03=Es erfordert mehr als das, um mich aufzuhalten.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill04=Dem Gleichgewicht wurde Genüge getan.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill05=Ha! Ich habe Euer Ohr ...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillArthas00=Nichts als ein Junge, der sich als Gott des Todes aufspielt.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillAzmodan00=Hmph. Duriel war stärker ... und er war eine riesige Made.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillD3Hero00=Und ich bin noch nicht mal ein Nephalem.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDeath00=So, ein "Meister des Todes" weniger, der hier unnütz herumsteht.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDemon00=Das Gleichgewicht muss aufrechterhalten werden, Dämon.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDiablo00=Fürst Diablo, ich habe Euch übertrumpft!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillLeoric00=Ich habe keine Verwendung für Untote, die mir den Gehorsam verweigern.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillMephisto00=Gute Reise, Mephisto. Meine besten Empfehlungen an den Abgrund!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Ich gebiete über die Macht des Todes.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillTyrael00=Verzeiht mir, Engel. Wer das Gleichgewicht stört, muss fallen.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillUndead00=Welche Verschwendung von untotem Fleisch.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillWitchDoctor00=Den Toten zu dienen verstößt gegen alle Naturgesetze, Hexendoktor.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillZeratul00=Ihr habt recht ... Sensen haben einen gewissen Charme.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh01=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh02=<hearty laugh>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh03=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh04=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh05=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh06=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh07=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh08=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ah, viel besser als diese widerwärtigen Tränke.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal01=Der Griff des Todes wird schwächer.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal02=Gut gemacht, Heiler. Sehr gut.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana00=Ich brauche Mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana01=Nicht genug Mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana02=Wenn ich doch bloß einen Manatrank hätte.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No00=Ha. Nein.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No01=Das kann ich nicht.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No02=Unmöglich.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No03=<seufz> Warum sollte ich das tun?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Unserem Verbündeten droht Gefahr.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich benötige Hilfe!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Kommt mir zu Hilfe!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Vernichtet ihre Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Nehmt dieses Söldnerlager ein.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Macht dieses Fort dem Erdboden gleich.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Hm ... dieser Beobachtungspunkt könnte sich als nützlich erweisen.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unsere Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verteidigt unser Fort!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Dieser Beobachtungspunkt darf nicht in ihre Hände fallen!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_KillHero00=Der Tod ruft nach diesem Helden.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed00=<genervt> Was?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed01=Müsst Ihr mich wirklich stören?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed02=Hm? Oh, ja, die Sense ist für mich auch neu. Aber ich muss zugeben, ich finde langsam Gefallen an ihr.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed03=Zwei Dinge sind unendlich, der Tod und die menschliche Dummheit, aber beim Tod bin ich mir noch nicht ganz sicher.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed04=Oh ... Der Tod steht Euch gut ...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed05=Wir, die Priester Rathmas, sind beauftragt, das Gleichgewicht aufrechtzuerhalten. Doch es scheint, dass viele dieses Konzept nicht verstehen.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed06=Stellt Euch das Gleichgewicht vor wie ein Netz ... ein unergründliches Sicherheitsnetz, das Eure rosig zarte Unerheblichkeit davor bewahrt, von der Leere verschlungen zu werden. Meine Aufgabe ist es, dieses Netz aufrechtzuerhalten. Ein kleines Dankeschön würde Euch nicht umbringen. Versteht Ihr? Umbringen? Hahaha...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed07=Der Anführer der Totenbeschwörer wird der Todessprecher genannt. Dreimal dürft Ihr raten, wovon er am liebsten spricht ...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed08=Zu meiner Zeit hätte Euch niemand geglaubt, wenn Ihr gesagt hättet, dass Nephalem wirklich existieren ... und doch sind welche hier! Ganze sechs Stück. Das ist ja doch wieder etwas übertrieben.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed09=Ihr denkt, das hier ist schwer? Ha! Das ist nicht mal der Hardcoremodus!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed10=Man erntet, was man sät ... und ich säe den Tod.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed11=Ja, ich erwecke Leute von den Toten, aber es ist kein schöner Anblick.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed12=Zum letzten Mal, Nekromantie hat nichts mit Unzüchtigkeit gegenüber den Toten zu tun. Ihr denkt an Nekro- ... wisst Ihr was? Lest mal ein Buch.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed13=Irgendwann sollte ich aus meinen ganzen gesammelten Ohren etwas Schönes machen. Hm, vielleicht einen Gurt.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed14=Bringt Eure Toten raus? Aber gerne doch ...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed15=Es ist nicht leicht, das Gleichgewicht aufrechtzuerhalten. Ich versuche einfach, hier mal einen Engel zu buffen, da mal einen Dämon zu nerfen ... Irgendwie klappt's am Ende schon.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected00=Ich kehre zurück ... aber nicht als Untoter. Diesen Trick müsst Ihr mir beibringen.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected01=Wahre Wiederbelebung? Das ist doch unmöglich ...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive00=So fühlt sich der Tod also an ... eigentlich ganz angenehm.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive01=Der große Kreislauf der Existenz beginnt erneut.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive02=Anscheinend werde ich hier noch gebraucht.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive03=Hm? Ich muss nicht zu meiner Leiche zurückrennen? Das gefällt mir.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec00=Interessant ...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec01=Damit werde ich meinen Spaß haben.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec02=So muss es sein.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec03=Verschlagen seid Ihr ...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec04=Ah. Darauf hatte ich ebenfalls ein Auge.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt00=Der Tod wird Euch holen.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt01=Ihr fürchtet mich zu Recht, aber es wird Euch nicht retten.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt02=Ich spüre ... Leben in Euch. Erlaubt mir, dem abzuhelfen.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/TeamKilled00=Lasst Euch nicht vom Tod in die Knie zwingen. Macht ihn Euch zunutze und rächt Euch.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExLocked00=Der Tod ist mir untertan.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah ... Euch kenne ich doch.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Gift00=Wie großzügig.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Lockin00=Es ist Zeit.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Purchase00=Ich ziehe wieder in den Kampf.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial00=Ein Kampf! Das ist schon eher nach meinem Geschmack.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial01=So, Ihr wollt etwas üben?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Wollen wir?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Kommt, stellt mich auf die Probe ... Mich verlangt nach einem Kampf.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=<Schaudern> Ich hätte mich wärmer anziehen sollen.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hm. Das Battle.net hat sich echt gemacht.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used00=Giftnova!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used01=Üble Pestilenz!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used02=Fauliger Atem der Toten.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used03=Toxische Essenz.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used00=Spürt den eisigen Hauch des Todes.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used01=Des Todes kalte Finger greifen nach Euch.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used02=Erhebt Euch und dient mir!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used03=Lasst ihnen das Blut in den Adern gefrieren.

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/WorthIt00=Glaubt Ihr, ich fürchte den Tod? Im Gegenteil, er ist mir hörig.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/WorthIt01=<lacht> Gut genug.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Yes00=Ich spüre den Tod an diesem Ort.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Yes01=Ich erhalte das Gleichgewicht aufrecht.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Yes02=Die Reise beginnt.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Yes03=Ich wache.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Yes04=Ah, der vertraute Geruch des Todes.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Yes05=Stets vorwärts.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Yes06=Voran in die Dunkelheit.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Yes07=Hm? Wie Ihr meint.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Yes08=So sei es.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Yes09=Ein lohnendes Ziel.
VoiceOver/NeverGoesLive/Draft_BanBlue00=Fort mit ihm.
VoiceOver/NeverGoesLive/Draft_BanRed00=Fort mit ihm.
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Attack00=Wir sollten zuschlagen, solange sie schwach sind.
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Attack01=Vorwärts! Sie sind genau da, wo wir sie haben wollen!
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Attack02=Los, los, los!
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Caution00=Pass auf dich auf.
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_GoodJob00=Sauber!
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_GoodJob01=Bestätige: Ziel ausgeschaltet.
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Heal00=Du bist schwer angeschlagen. Such dir einen Heilbrunnen.
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Heal01=Such dir lieber schleunigst einen Heilbrunnen.
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Retreat00=Trete einen taktischen Rückzug an.
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Retreat01=Muss mich erst mal zurückziehen.
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Uhoh00=Verdammt noch mal.
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Uhoh01=Na klasse.
VoiceOver/Nova/AI_Uhoh02=Hier wird ein Leichensack gebraucht.
VoiceOver/Nova/Attack00=Leite Angriff ein.
VoiceOver/Nova/Attack01=Gehe in die Offensive.
VoiceOver/Nova/Attack02=Ziel wird ausgeschaltet.
VoiceOver/Nova/Attack03=Ein Schuss, ein Treffer.
VoiceOver/Nova/Attack04=Im Visier.
VoiceOver/Nova/Attack05=Greife an.
VoiceOver/Nova/Attack06=Nähere mich dem Ziel.
VoiceOver/Nova/ByeBye00=Du fehlst mir schon jetzt.
VoiceOver/Nova/ByeBye01=Tschüss!
VoiceOver/Nova/ByeBye02=<lacht> Nichts, was ein orbitaler Laser nicht richten könnte.
VoiceOver/Nova/Celebrate00=Ausgezeichnet, weiter so!
VoiceOver/Nova/Celebrate01=Genau so!
VoiceOver/Nova/Comeback00=Wir schließen auf! Behaltet das Ziel im Auge!
VoiceOver/Nova/Death00=<Todesröcheln>
VoiceOver/Nova/Death01=<Todesröcheln>
VoiceOver/Nova/Death02=<Todesröcheln>
VoiceOver/Nova/Healed00=Gibt keinen besseren Sani!
VoiceOver/Nova/Healed01=Danke fürs Heilen.
VoiceOver/Nova/Healed02=Immer weiter so schön heilen!
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroAgree00=Ganz meine Meinung.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroAgree01=Klingt lustig.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroAgree02=Wollen wir wetten, wer als Erstes einen erledigt?
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroBoast00=Dann wollen wir denen mal zeigen, was 'ne Harke ist.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroBoast01=Das wird 'ne hübsche Überraschung.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroQuestion00=Bereit, es krachen zu lassen?
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroQuestion01=Was meint ihr? Sollen wir uns ein wenig Spaß gönnen?
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=Kerrigan ...
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroQuestion_Murky00=<seufzt> Warum wurde ich in das gleiche Team wie der Fisch gesteckt?
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Unfassbar, dass sie mich in dein Team gesteckt haben.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Sieh mal einer an, wer auch da ist. Das wird spannend.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroQuestion_Raynor00=Sieh mal einer an, James Raynor.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroQuestion_Tychus00=Konzentrier dich auf das Schlachtfeld, Tychus.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroRespond00=Verstanden.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroRespond01=Denen wird Hören und Sehen vergehen.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroRespond02=Da musst du fragen? <lacht>
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroResponse_Ana00=Red du nur.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroResponse_Ask00=Da musst du fragen? <lacht>
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroResponse_Brightwing00=Es ist unhöflich, andere Leute anzustarren.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Red du nur.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroResponse_Murky00=<seufzt> Ich hasse Sushi.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroResponse_Negative00=Ich freu mich schon darauf, wenn sie meine Erinnerungen an dich wieder löschen.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroResponse_Positive00=Vielleicht wird das hier ja doch recht unterhaltsam.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroResponse_Raynor00=Mehr als du, Marshal.
VoiceOver/Nova/IntroResponse_Tychus00=Nenn mich noch einmal "Schätzchen" und du verschluckst dich an 'ner Kugel. Kapiert?
VoiceOver/Nova/Kill00=Nimm's nicht persönlich.
VoiceOver/Nova/Kill01=Behalt die Kugel und vergiss mich nicht.
VoiceOver/Nova/Kill02=Du hast ausgespukt.
VoiceOver/Nova/Kill03=Mein Ziel entkommt mir nie.
VoiceOver/Nova/Kill04=Ha! <blow kiss>
VoiceOver/Nova/KillDemonHunter00=So wird die Jägerin zur Beute.
VoiceOver/Nova/KillFaerieDragon00=Offensichtlich kann ich sogar einem Schmetterling die Flügel abschießen.
VoiceOver/Nova/KillKerrigan00=Das wird auch nie langweilig.
VoiceOver/Nova/KillKing00=Und damit steht jetzt auch "Militärputsch" auf meinem Lebenslauf ...
VoiceOver/Nova/KillPrince00=Schlaf gut, mein Prinz.
VoiceOver/Nova/KillRaynor00=Wir sehen uns, Jim.
VoiceOver/Nova/KillSpreeEnd00=Und genau deshalb zahlt man mir so viel.
VoiceOver/Nova/KillSylvanas00=Pfeile? Pfff, wie mittelalterlich.
VoiceOver/Nova/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Nova/LowLifeHeal00=Du hast mir tatsächlich gerade das Leben gerettet.
VoiceOver/Nova/LowLifeHeal01=Das war knapp. Danke.
VoiceOver/Nova/LowLifeHeal02=Danke, das hab ich gebraucht.
VoiceOver/Nova/LowMana00=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/Nova/LowMana01=Hab nicht mehr viel Mana.
VoiceOver/Nova/LowMana02=Ich habe wenig Mana.
VoiceOver/Nova/No00=Nein.
VoiceOver/Nova/No01=Negativ.
VoiceOver/Nova/No02=Das kann ich nicht.
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter braucht Hilfe.
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_AssistMe00=Könnte ein wenig Verstärkung gebrauchen!
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_AssistMe01=Könnte ein wenig Hilfe brauchen.
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_AttackCastle00=Wir sollten ihre Zitadelle angreifen.
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten dieses Söldnerlager einnehmen.
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Jemand Lust, ein Fort einzustampfen?
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_AttackTower00=Lasst uns diesen Beobachtungspunkt einnehmen.
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt die Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Wir sollten dieses Fort verteidigen.
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir müssen diesen Beobachtungspunkt verteidigen.
VoiceOver/Nova/Ping_KillHero00=Terminiert diesen Helden.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed00=Nova hier.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed01=Hab nicht den ganzen Tag Zeit.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed02=Nein, ich bin nicht Kerrigan ... und wenn ich mein eigenes Spiel hätte, wüsstest du das.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed03=Die beste und wichtigste Waffe eines Ghosts ist sein Verstand. Alles andere ist nur ein Bonus.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed04=Wenn sie noch leben, liegt das nur daran, dass ich sie noch nicht getötet habe.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed05=Es stimmt einfach: Weibliche Ghosts haben schickere ... Ausrüstung.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed06=Pass auf, wo du hinklickst. Ich bin mehr als nur ein scharfes Stück Fleisch.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed07=Kennst du schon den mit ... <männliche Stimme:> Dieser Witz wurde auf unbestimmte Zeit verschoben.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed08=Hast du 'ne Nuklearrakete in der Hose oder freust du dich nur, mich zu sehen?
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed09=Nun, alles, was ich den ganzen Tag in der Ghost-Akademie höre, ist wie toll Sarah dies kann ... oder wie großartig Kerrigan jenes gemacht hat ... Kerrigan! Kerrigan! Kerrigan!
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed10=Zielen, abdrücken. <imitiert Schussgeräusch>
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed11=<Pause> Buh!
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed12=Wenn du meinst, DU hättest Probleme mit deinen Eltern, dann hast du meine Geschichte noch nicht gehört.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed13=Ich kann nicht glauben, dass ich mit Tosh rumgemacht habe ... Oder wurden in dem Manga meine Erinnerungen gelöscht? Das vergess ich immer.
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed14=Blondinen wissen einfach, wie man Spaß hat. Siehst du, <Schuss> das macht Spaß!
VoiceOver/Nova/Pissed15=<Schuss> <Schuss> <Schrei> <Körper fällt zu Boden> <Männliche Stimme:> Sie haben ihn umgebracht! <Nova:> Nein, ich hab auf ihn geschossen. Die Kugeln und der Sturz haben ihn umgebracht.
VoiceOver/Nova/Resurrected00=Danke für die Hilfe.
VoiceOver/Nova/Resurrected01=Alles klar, bin wieder da.
VoiceOver/Nova/Revive00=Ghost zur Stelle.
VoiceOver/Nova/Revive01=So leicht sterb ich nicht.
VoiceOver/Nova/Revive02=Nova hier.
VoiceOver/Nova/Spec00=Du verwöhnst mich.
VoiceOver/Nova/Spec01=Ich werde immer besser.
VoiceOver/Nova/Spec02=Muss man einfach lieben.
VoiceOver/Nova/Spec03=Upgrade durchgeführt.
VoiceOver/Nova/Spec04=Ausrüstung angelegt.
VoiceOver/Nova/Taunt00=Ich hab dich im Visier.
VoiceOver/Nova/Taunt01=Genieß es, solange du noch kannst.
VoiceOver/Nova/Taunt02=Deine Zeit ist abgelaufen.
VoiceOver/Nova/TeamKilled00=Oh Mann, das stinkt.
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_ExLocked00=Nova hier.
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_ExPurchased00=Sieh mal einer an.
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_Gift00=Da wird sich jemand freuen.
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_Lockin00=Geladen und entsichert.
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_Purchase00=Glückwunsch zu deiner neuen Lieblingsheldin.
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_Trial00=Ich hinterlasse immer einen Eindruck.
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_Trial01=Soll ich dich mal beeindrucken?
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_WaitLocked00=Es ist unhöflich, andere Leute anzustarren.
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_WaitLocked01=Du weißt schon, dass es deutlich unterhaltsamer ist, wenn du meine Fähigkeiten ausprobierst, anstatt nur ihre Beschreibungen zu lesen.
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_WaitPurchased00=Hasst du es nicht auch, wenn dir der Finger am Abzug juckt?
VoiceOver/Nova/UI_WaitPurchased01=Na dann ... wollen wir uns mal in ein Spiel stürzen?
VoiceOver/Nova/Ultimate1Used00=Ziel ausschalten. Verstanden.
VoiceOver/Nova/Ultimate1Used01=Auslöschen, ohne jede Gnade.
VoiceOver/Nova/Ultimate2Used00=Orbitalkanone synchronisiert.

VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSelect00=Bereitet Euch auf den Kampf vor, Helden!
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSelectPlayer00=Aha, der Wandervogel kehrt nach Hause zurück ...
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSelectPlayer01=Was machst du da, Orphea? Wenn das hier vorbei ist, kehrst du sofort zum Turm zurück!
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSelectPlayer02=Sieh an, sieh an ... wenn das nicht meine Frau Tochter ist. Schauen wir mal, ob du ausnahmsweise mal Befehlen folgen kannst.
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSelect_Observer00=Das sollte unterhaltsam werden.
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSlain00=Ihr wurdet getötet.
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSlain01=Ausweichen könnte keine schlechte Idee sein.
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSlain02=Ein guter Versuch.
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSlain03=Oh je.
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSlain04=Zahlt es ihnen heim!
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSlain05=<gespieltes Mitleid: Och> Eine Schande. Dabei hattet Ihr es fast geschafft.
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSlain06=Mmmh.
VoiceOver/RavenLord/HeroSlain07=Ihr seid verstorben. Falls es Euch noch nicht aufgefallen ist.

VoiceOver/RavenLord/MegaKill00=Megakill.

VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_Attack01=Geht in die Offensive!
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_Attack02=Heizen wir ihnen ein!
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_Caution00=Bleibt lieber in der Nähe. Da ist etwas Seltsames auf dem Radar.
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_GoodJob00=Yeehaw! Das war ganze Arbeit!
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_GoodJob01=Hätte ich selbst nicht besser machen können.
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_GoodJob02=Oh, yeah!
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_Heal00=Du solltest mal bei einem Heilbrunnen vorbeischauen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_Heal01=Sieht aus, als ob's dir nicht so gut geht. Such dir am besten einen Heilbrunnen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_Retreat00=Hier wird's mir zu heiß. Ich zieh mich zurück.
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_Retreat01=Ich trete besser den Rückzug an.
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_Uhoh00=Verdammt.
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_Uhoh01=Das hat mir gerade noch gefehlt.
VoiceOver/Raynor/AI_Uhoh02=Argh, Mist.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Attack00=Auf ins Getümmel.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Attack01=Geben wir ihnen Saures.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Attack02=Ich hab da 'was für dich!

VoiceOver/Raynor/Healed02=Besten Dank.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroAgree00=Das könnte gut werden.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroAgree01=Aber so was von.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroAgree02=Da bin ich dabei.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroBoast00=Die werden noch bereuen, hier aufgekreuzt zu sein.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroBoast01=Zeigen wir diesen Bastarden, wo der Ausgang ist.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion00=Wollen wir denen dann mal den Hintern versohlen?
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion01=Bereit, die Show in Gang zu bringen?
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion_Artanis00=Wie geht es denn meinem Lieblings-Hierarchen?
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion_InfestedTychus00=Tychus, was ist denn mit dir passiert?
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=Bist du bereit, Liebling?
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Was zum Teufel bist du denn für einer?
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Ich freu mich nicht besonders, an deiner Seite zu kämpfen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion_Nova00=Bist du dafür auch bereit, Blondie?
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Na sowas. Schön, dass du auch dabei bist.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion_Tychus00=Wie in alten Zeiten, was, Tychus?
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroQuestion_Zeratul00=Fühlt sich fast schon wie früher an.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroRespond00=Na klar.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroRespond01=Musst du das überhaupt fragen?
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroRespond02=Braten wir ihnen eins über.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_Artanis00=Du hast wie immer Recht.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_InfestedTychus00=Na ja, nicht wirklich ...
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Aber immer doch.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_Murky00=Weiß nicht, ob du lieber langsamer oder schneller reden solltest ... ich habe überhaupt keine Ahnung, was du mir sagen willst.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_Negative00=Bringen wir es hinter uns.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_Nova00=Tu mir einen Gefallen und schieß diesmal nicht auf mich.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_Positive00=Das könnte spaßig werden.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_Rock00=Was soll ich noch mal sagen?
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_Tychus00=Wie in alten Zeiten ...
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_Yes00=Na klar.
VoiceOver/Raynor/IntroResponse_Zeratul00=Oh Mann, der alte Adler fehlt mir doch sehr.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Kill00=Kopfschuss!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Kill01=Mein Beileid.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Kill02=Du musst noch schneller werden.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Kill03=Pech gehabt.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Kill04=<lacht> Genau zwischen die Augen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/KillDiablo00=Tja, wieder einer mehr für mich, mein Roter.
VoiceOver/Raynor/KillKerrigan00=Verdammt, Sarah. So hätte das nicht enden müssen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/KillNova00=Das war dafür, dass du auf mich geschossen hast.
VoiceOver/Raynor/KillSpreeEnd00=War doch gar nicht so schwer.
VoiceOver/Raynor/KillTychus00=Wie viele Lektionen muss ich dir eigentlich erteilen, Tychus?
VoiceOver/Raynor/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Raynor/LowLifeHeal00=Dachte schon, es wär vorbei mit mir.
VoiceOver/Raynor/LowLifeHeal01=<seufzt> Echt gut, dass es dich gibt.
VoiceOver/Raynor/LowLifeHeal02=Danke für die Rettung.
VoiceOver/Raynor/LowMana00=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/Raynor/LowMana01=Hab bald kein Mana mehr.
VoiceOver/Raynor/LowMana02=Ich brauche mehr Mana, Partner.
VoiceOver/Raynor/No00=Daraus wird nichts.
VoiceOver/Raynor/No01=Das können wir vergessen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/No02=Da verlangst du Unmögliches.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Kumpel steckt in der Klemme.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich könnte hier etwas Hilfe gebrauchen!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_AssistMe01=Ich steh hier mit einem Fuß im Grab!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_AttackCastle00=Greifen wir ihre Zitadelle an!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten uns dieses Söldnerlager zur Brust nehmen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Es gibt da ein Fort, das wir einstampfen sollten.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_AttackTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt sichern.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_DefendCastle00=Lasst alles stehen und liegen und haltet sie von unserer Zitadelle fern!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verscheucht sie von unserem Fort.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir müssen diesen Beobachtungspunkt verteidigen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ping_KillHero00=Die Sau geht mir gehörig auf die Nerven!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed00=Hier ist Jimmy.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed01=Na gut, was gibt's denn?
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed02=Finger weg von Mar Sara.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed03=Yippie ai-ay.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed04=Ich suche zwar nie nach Ärger, er scheint mich aber immer zu finden ... für gewöhnlich in einer Bar.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed05=Schon komisch ... ich bin seit Jahren kein Marshal mehr und trotzdem hab ich immer das Gefühl, dass mir der Magistrat über die Schulter guckt.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed06=<atmet hörbar aus> Was fasziniert mich nur so an Mädels mit Pferdeschwanz?
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed07=Ich habe festgestellt, dass jedes Mal, wenn ich in meinem Leben schnelle Entscheidungen treffen muss, die erste Entscheidung jeweils die zum Kanon gehörige ist.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed08=Okay, mir ist langweilig. Höchste Zeit, dass hier irgendwas mal einen Gang zulegt.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed09=Und wenn es hart auf hart kommt ... ruf ich meine geliebte Hyperion und lass sie alles wegbomben!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed10=<Eiswürfel klimpern> Hallo! Ich sitz hier ein wenig auf dem Trockenen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed11=Habt ihr schon mal überlegt, was passiert, wenn man StarCraft rückwärts spielt? Ich bekomm meinen Adler zurück und mein Mädel, mein Planet wird nicht von den Protoss in Glas verwandelt - und eigentlich läuft alles ziemlich gut.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed12=Ich fang an, meine Jukebox zu vermissen ...
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed13=Nach allem, was wir durchgestanden haben, dem Chaos und der Zerstörung ... weiß ich eines ganz genau: In 30 Minuten ist Feierabend.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed14=<terran up the night begins playing> Hey, ist das Liberty Rock? Ja? Haha, gut, dann dreh mal auf!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Resurrected00=Der Retter in der Not.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Resurrected01=Klasse Timing!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Revive00=Ich schätze ... so was kommt vor.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Revive01=Legen wir los.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Revive02=Oh, Mann ... Daran werd ich mich nie gewöhnen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Spec00=Jetzt bin ich für alles zu haben.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Spec01=Spitzenmäßig.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Spec02=So gefällt mir das.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Spec03=Sieht gleich viel besser aus.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Spec04=Ob mir Swann auch so was zaubern könnte?
VoiceOver/Raynor/Taunt00=Verzieh dich bloß!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Taunt01=Dieser Weg ist nicht groß genug für uns beide.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Taunt02=Willst du dich etwa mit dem alten Jimmy anlegen?
VoiceOver/Raynor/TeamKilled00=Jetzt noch mal von vorn – lasst uns das Ding gewinnen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_ExLocked00=Hallo Kumpel.
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_ExPurchased00=Was liegt an?
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_Gift00=Los geht's, Raiders!
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_Lockin00=Kann jederzeit losgehen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_Purchase00=<lacht> Aber klar doch.
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_Trial00=Mit so was kann ich mich anfreunden.
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_Trial01=Dann will ich mich mal für dich in Schale werfen.
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_WaitLocked00=Lauf nicht zu weit weg.
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_WaitLocked01=Wenn mich einer hier rausholt, ernenn ich ihn zum Ehrenmitglied der Raiders. Das ist doch was, oder?
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_WaitPurchased00=Wie geht es meinem Lieblings-Raider denn heute?
VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ich bin Commander Raynor und das ist mein Lieblingsgeschäft im Nexus.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ultimate1Used00=Schnell und hart zuschlagen!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ultimate1Used01=Zeig es ihnen, Matt!
VoiceOver/Raynor/Ultimate2Used00=Setzt die Jungs hier ab!

VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_Collect00=Die hier sollten wir einsammeln.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_Collect01=Los, schnappt euch ein paar davon.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_Danger00=Gar nicht gut.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_Danger01=Passt auf euren Rücken auf.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_Defend00=Wir müssen hier schleunigst eine Verteidigung aufstellen.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DefendCastle00=Lasst alles stehen und liegen und haltet sie von unserer Zitadelle fern!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verscheucht sie von unserem Fort.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DefendStructure00=Das sollten wir besser verteidigen.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DefendStructure01=Behaltet das Gebäude da im Auge.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DefendThing00=Kümmert euch um die Verteidigung!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DefendThing01=Jetzt müssen wir die Verteidigung aufrecht erhalten.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir müssen diesen Beobachtungspunkt verteidigen.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Machen wir Kleinholz draus.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Schnell, zerstört es!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DestroyThing00=Jetzt sollten wir das Ziel hier ausschalten.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_DestroyThing01=Verpass dem Ding doch mal einer 'ne Kugel.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Augen auf, Leute. Da hat sich einer verkrümelt.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_EnemyMissing01=Hmm, wo bist du denn jetzt hin verschwunden?
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_KillHero00=Die Sau geht mir gehörig auf die Nerven!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_OnMyWay00=Bin auf dem Weg zu dir.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_OnMyWay01=Bin sofort da.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_Retreat00=Zieht euch zurück!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_Retreat01=Lauf! Hier geht's gerade bergab.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_Transport00=Bringt ein wenig Bewegung in die Sache!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_Transport01=Sehen wir zu, dass die Dame hier vom Fleck kommt.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_TurnIn00=Gebt einfach alles ab, Leute.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ping_TurnIn01=Abgeben, aber schnell.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed00=Hier ist Jimmy.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed01=Na gut, was gibt's denn?
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed02=Finger weg von Mar Sara.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed03=Yippie ai-ay.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed04=Ich suche zwar nie nach Ärger, er scheint mich aber immer zu finden ... für gewöhnlich in einer Bar.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed05=Schon komisch ... ich bin seit Jahren kein Marshal mehr und trotzdem hab ich immer das Gefühl, dass mir der Magistrat über die Schulter guckt.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed06=<atmet hörbar aus> Was fasziniert mich nur so an Mädels mit Pferdeschwanz?
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed07=Ich habe festgestellt, dass jedes Mal, wenn ich in meinem Leben schnelle Entscheidungen treffen muss, die erste Entscheidung jeweils die zum Kanon gehörige ist.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed08=Okay, mir ist langweilig. Höchste Zeit, dass hier irgendwas mal einen Gang zulegt.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed09=Und wenn es hart auf hart kommt ... ruf ich meine geliebte Hyperion und lass sie alles wegbomben!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed10=<Eiswürfel klimpern> Hallo! Ich sitz hier ein wenig auf dem Trockenen.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed11=Habt ihr schon mal überlegt, was passiert, wenn man StarCraft rückwärts spielt? Ich bekomm meinen Adler zurück und mein Mädel, mein Planet wird nicht von den Protoss in Glas verwandelt - und eigentlich läuft alles ziemlich gut.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed12=Ich fang an, meine Jukebox zu vermissen ...
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed13=Nach allem, was wir durchgestanden haben, dem Chaos und der Zerstörung ... weiß ich eines ganz genau: In 30 Minuten ist Feierabend.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Pissed14=<terran up the night begins playing> Hey, ist das Liberty Rock? Ja? Haha, gut, dann dreh mal auf!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Resurrected00=Der Retter in der Not.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Resurrected01=Klasse Timing!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/RevengeEnd00=Ich hab's dir doch gesagt: Bösewichte gewinnen nie.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/RevengeEnd01=Und tot bist du. Gefällt dir das?
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/RevengeEnd02=Träum was Schönes.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/RevengeStart00=Dich mach ich fertig.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/RevengeStart01=Das hättest du lieber nicht tun sollen.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/RevengeStart02=Ich hab hier 'ne Kugel, auf der dein Name steht.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Revive00=Ich schätze ... so was kommt vor.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Revive01=Legen wir los.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Revive02=Oh, Mann ... Daran werd ich mich nie gewöhnen.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_Dance00=Ja, so geht das!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_Dance01=Oh ja, ich hab den besten Groove!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_Goodbye00=Adios, Partner.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_Goodbye01=Bis später!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_Hello00=Hallo!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_Hello01=Wie steht's?
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_Sorry00=Entschuldigung. Tut mir echt leid, Partner.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_Sorry01=Oh das, hmm, tja, das tut mir leid. Ehrlich.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_Thanks00=Recht herzlichen Dank.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_Thanks01=Tja, danke.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_WellPlayed00=Ich muss zugeben, das war nicht schlecht.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Social_WellPlayed01=<lacht> Sehr gut, Partner.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Spec00=Jetzt bin ich für alles zu haben.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Spec01=Spitzenmäßig.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Spec02=So gefällt mir das.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Spec03=Sieht gleich viel besser aus.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Spec04=Ob mir Swann auch so was zaubern könnte?
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Taunt00=Verzieh dich bloß!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Taunt01=Dieser Weg ist nicht groß genug für uns beide.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Taunt02=Willst du dich etwa mit dem alten Jimmy anlegen?
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/TeamKilled00=Jetzt noch mal von vorn – lasst uns das Ding gewinnen.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_ExLocked00=Hallo Kumpel.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_ExPurchased00=Was liegt an?
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_Gift00=Los geht's, Raiders!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_Lockin00=Kann jederzeit losgehen.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_Purchase00=<lacht> Aber klar doch.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_Trial00=Mit so was kann ich mich anfreunden.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_Trial01=Dann will ich mich mal für dich in Schale werfen.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_WaitLocked00=Lauf nicht zu weit weg.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_WaitLocked01=Wenn mich einer hier rausholt, ernenn ich ihn zum Ehrenmitglied der Raiders. Das ist doch was, oder?
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_WaitPurchased00=Wie geht es meinem Lieblings-Raider denn heute?
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ich bin Commander Raynor und das ist mein Lieblingsgeschäft im Nexus.
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ultimate1Used00=Schnell und hart zuschlagen!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ultimate1Used01=Zeig es ihnen, Matt!
VoiceOver/RaynorCommander/Ultimate2Used00=Setzt die Jungs hier ab!

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Die Zeit ändert vieles, Krokifutter. Da bin ich keine Ausnahme.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill00=Hah! Ich hab's noch drauf!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill01=Bleibt liegen ... das ist wesentlich einfacher.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill02=Bei Euch hat man wohl auf den Falschen gewettet.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill03=Ihr müsst noch VIEL mehr trainieren.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Kill04=Sagt mir, dass Ihr nicht alles gegeben habt.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillBarbarian00=Endlich eine würdige Gegnerin!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillHuman00=Keine Chance, Bleichhaut.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillMalfurion00=Ach, Druiden sehen doch alle gleich aus.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillMarine00=Diese Rüstung ist nur Verschwendung.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Hochmut kommt vor dem Fall.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillThrall00=Es war eine Ehre, Kriegshäuptling.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/KillVarian00=Ha, guter Versuch, Krokifutter!

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ihr seid Euer Gewicht in Gold wert.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ich schulde Euch mein Leben.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowMana00=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowMana01=<verärgertes Knurren> Nicht genug Mana.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/LowMana02=Dafür brauche ich mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/No00=Nein.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/No01=Ihr macht wohl Witze.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/No02=Verschwendet nicht meine Zeit.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Mitstreiter braucht Hilfe.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich bräuchte hier mal jemanden.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Ich schaff das nicht allein.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zerstört die Zitadelle des Gegners.

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir müssen diesen Beobachtungspunkt verteidigen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ping_KillHero00=Nehmt diesen Helden aus dem Kampf.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed00=Ja?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed01=Was wollt Ihr von mir?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed02=Meine Geschichte ist wie die aller Orcs. Unbändig und wild, aber auch eine Geschichte der Erlösung. Vielleicht erzähle ich sie Euch eines Tages.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed03=Finger weg, Jungchen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed04=Ich hab gesagt, Finger weg! Dafür bin ich DEFINITIV der falsche Orc!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed05=Mein Krafttier ist der Wolf. Das sieht man doch, oder?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed06=Wir Sterbliche sind nur Staub und Schatten ...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed07=Muln Erdenwut? Nein, mit diesem alten Ochsen bin ich nicht verwandt. <Pause> Obwohl man sagen könnte, dass meine Urgroßmutter eine olle Kuh war ...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed08=Wisst Ihr ... ich habe Jahre lang Schlachtzüge bestritten und trotzdem nie den Helm dieses Sets bekommen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed09=Man sagt, nur ein Schamane selbst darf die Ausrichtung und das Gewicht seines Totems kennen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed10=Überlegt Euch das mal. Wir machen eine World-of-Warcraft-Erweiterung von, mit und für Schamanen. World of Shamcraft. Das Ding ... verkauft sich dann von selbst.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed11=Bah, was riecht hier so nach nassem Hund? <Pause> Ach ja ...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed12=Was? Ich trag doch keinen Rock ... Das sind Beinplatten ... Ungelogen! <Pause> Wisst Ihr was, guckt doch einfach auf Wowhead, wenn Ihr es mir nicht glaubt.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed13=Donner! Blitz! <lauter Knall> Uff, das jagt einem schon irgendwie Angst ein.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed14=Sagt es nicht weiter, aber manchmal verwandel ich mich in die Geisterwolfgestalt, nur um zu tanzen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed15=Nun gut, wenn Ihr jetzt sofort mit dem Geklicke aufhört, teile ich meinen Gewinn mit Euch; 60-40.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed16=Ich muss sagen, diese "Videospiele" gefallen mir ja doch ganz gut. Das sollte ich öfter mal versuchen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed17=Heroes of the Storm? Helden des Sturms, ja? Na wenn es bei dem Sturm auch gewittert, dann hab ich glatt einen unfairen Vorteil. <Donnerknall> <lacht>
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Resurrected00=Zurück in den Kampf!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Resurrected01=Auf Euch ist Verlass.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Revive00=Die Geister rufen mich in den Kampf!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Revive01=Weiter geht's. Nächste Runde.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Revive02=Ah, das tut jedes mal weh.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec00=Meine Macht wächst!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec01=Das sollte helfen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec02=Ich mag Eure Denkweise.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec03=Das wird sie eiskalt erwischen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec04=Ahnen, segnet mich.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt00=Kluge Köpfe wetten auf mich!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt01=Glaubt Ihr wirklich, Ihr kommt hier lebend raus?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt02=Noch ein Schwächling. Bringen wir es hinter uns.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/TeamKilled00=Konzentriert Euch! Wir können sie noch schlagen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_ExLocked00=Mok'ra!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Mögen die Ahnen über Euch wachen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Gift00=Ein neuer Mitstreiter? Ich hoffe, er hat etwas auf dem Kasten.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Lockin00=Ich kämpfe bis zum letzten Atemzug.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Purchase00=Zurück in die Arena!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Trial00=Behaltet den alten Rehgar gut im Auge, dann könnt Ihr noch was lernen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Trial01=Passt gut auf, ich zeige Euch das nämlich nur ein Mal.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Hm, das wird aber ziemlich schnell langweilig.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Ich sitze nicht gern auf der Ersatzbank.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Wie macht Thrall das nur mit dem ständigen Herumstehen?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ihr wisst schon, dass wir uns auch genauso gut in den Kampf stürzen könnten ...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate1Used00=Fühlt die Macht der Horde.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate1Used01=Spürt den Rausch im Blut.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate2Used00=Mögen die Ahnen über Euch wachen!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate2Used01=Mögen die Geister Euch retten!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate2Used02=Seid geheilt!

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/VoiceLineThree00=Congratulations. Now, you have my attention.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/VoiceLineTwo00=You messed with the wrong shaman.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/WorthIt00=Ha! Dachtet Ihr, Ihr könnt mich besiegen?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/WorthIt01=Ich liebe es, wenn ein Plan funktioniert.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes00=Winde, führt mich auf meinem Weg!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes01=Dabu.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes02=Ich kann ihre Angst riechen.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes03=Lok-regar!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes04=Haha, gut genug.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes05=Verstanden.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes06=Sofort.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes07=Eine gute Wahl.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Yes08=Auf geht's.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Attack00=Sie sind geschwächt! Greift an!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Attack01=Schlagt jetzt zu, solange der Feind geschwächt ist.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Attack02=Zum Angriff!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Caution00=Gebt acht. Gefahr droht.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_GoodJob00=Gut gejagt.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_GoodJob01=Ha! Gut gemacht.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_GoodJob02=Sehr gut. Gemeinsam sind wir stark.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Heal00=Eure Wunden sind tief. Heilt Euch.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Heal01=Was macht Ihr noch hier? Ihr braucht Heilung!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Retreat00=Ich muss mich zurückziehen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Retreat01=Ich muss mich erholen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Uhoh00=Das ist unerfreulich.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/AI_Uhoh01=<sigh>

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Attack00=Bei Reißzahn und Klaue!

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Attack03=Für die Horde!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Attack04=Sterbt!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Attack05=Jagt sie raus!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Attack06=Ich hab Euch im Blick!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Celebrate00=Ha!

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Healed01=Meinen Dank.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Healed02=Weiter so, Heiler!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroAgree00=Das dürfte unterhaltsam werden.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroAgree01=Hmm, einverstanden.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroAgree02=Ihr habt meine Axt.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroBoast00=Heute jage ich nicht allein.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroBoast01=Lasst die Jagd beginnen!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion00=Kann die Jagd beginnen?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion01=Ich hoffe, Ihr seid bereit ...
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Vergesst nicht, wer hier Euer Feind ist, Dämon.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Chen00=Chen! Kraft und Ehre, Braumeister!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_DemonHunter00=Seid gegrüßt, Jäger.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Gazlowe00=Gazlowe. Seid Ihr bereit?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Hearthstone00=Lasst die Jagd beginnen!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Lok'tar ogar!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Jaina. Es ist schon eine Weile her, seit ...
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Euch hat es aber weit weg von den Echoinseln verschlagen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Hmph. Ihr seid es.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Ah, es ist schön, Euch zu sehen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Samuro00=Ah, Klingenmeister. Lang ist's her.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Kriegshäuptling. Es ist mir eine Ehre.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroRespond00=Aber natürlich.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroRespond01=Hmpf. Komm, Misha.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroRespond02=Meine Taten sprechen für mich.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Ruhe, sonst mache ich Bärenfutter aus Euch.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Ein Bündnis mit Dämonen ... Diese Welt ist wirklich seltsam.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Chen00=In der Tat. Kommt, Chen, lasst uns gemeinsam auf die Jagd gehen wie früher.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_DemonHunter00=Endlich jemand, der Ahnung vom Jagen hat.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=<Knurren>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Gazlowe00=Bin ein paar Jahre lang in Desolace herumgeirrt, aber sonst kann ich nicht klagen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=Für die Horde!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Hmm, konzentrieren wir uns auf den Kampf.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hm, Ihr seid ein beherzter Kämpfer. Interessant.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=<zu sich selbst> Deswegen sind mir Tiere als Gefährten lieber.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=Ah, Ihr seid es ... schon wieder.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ich kämpfe lieber mit Tieren, aber für Euch mache ich eine Ausnahme.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Samuro00=Ich bin froh, dass Ihr wohlauf seid, Bruder.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Kriegshäuptling ... Es ist schön, wieder an Eurer Seite zu kämpfen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/IntroResponse_Tired00=Ugh, ich bin das jetzt schon leid.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill00=Das war unausweichlich.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill01=Ein guter Kampf.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill02=Ha! Mitten ins Gesicht!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill03=An Euren Überresten werden sich wilde Tiere laben.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Kill04=Nicht abschlecken, Misha. Wer weiß, wo das vorher gewesen ist.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillButcher00=Ich dachte, IHR sollt aus MIR Hackfleisch machen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillChen00=Ein guter Versuch, Chen. Leider nicht gut genug.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillChogall00=Schwächlinge wie Ihr bringen Schande über alle Oger.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillDemonHunter00=Ihr nennt Euch Jäger und doch endet Ihr nur allzu oft als Beute.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillHorde00=Ruht in Frieden, Held der Horde.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillJaina00=Hmpf, wie der Vater, so die Tochter.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Ganz einfach.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/KillThrall00=Vergebt mir, Kriegshäuptling.

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowLifeHeal00=Das war knapp. Danke.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowLifeHeal01=Mmm. Danke, mein Freund.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowLifeHeal02=Viel besser.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana00=Ich habe nicht viel Mana.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana01=Ich habe nicht genug Mana.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/LowMana02=Nicht genug Mana.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel00=Misha, zu mir!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel01=Hierher, Misha!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel02=Komm her, Misha!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/MishaHeel03=Misha! Hierher!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge00=Fass!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge01=Reiß sie in Stücke, Misha!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge02=Schnapp sie dir!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Charge03=Los, Misha!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel00=Misha, zu mir!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel01=Komm her, Misha!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel02=Misha! Hierher!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel03=Hierher, Misha!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel04=Hier, Misha.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel05=Zu mir, Misha.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Misha_Heel06=Misha, komm zu mir!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No00=Unmöglich.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No01=Ihr verlangt das Unmögliche.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/No02=Das kann ich nicht tun.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter braucht Hilfe.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich brauche Hilfe.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Zu mir, Krieger, schnell.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Legt ihre Zitadelle in Trümmer!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Lasst uns ein paar Söldner "rekrutieren".
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Wir sollten dieses Fort angreifen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Es wäre eine weise Entscheidung, diesen Beobachtungspunkt einzunehmen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt sofort unsere Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Wir müssen dieses Fort verteidigen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Verteidigt diesen Beobachtungspunkt!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ping_KillHero00=Tötet diesen Helden.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed00=Bin zur Spurensuche bereit.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed01=Meine Beute naht.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed02=Ich werde Euch nie einen Bären aufbinden. Ihr würdet Misha nicht überleben.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed03=Ihr glaubt, die Jagd mit dem Bogen ist die ultimative Herausforderung? Dann habt Ihr wohl noch nie mit einer Axt gejagt.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed04=Du hast immer einen Bärenhunger, nicht wahr, meine Kleine?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed05=Nur damit das klar ist: Die ganze Beute werde ich brauchen ... aus ... Jägergründen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed06=Nicht alle Mok'Nathal sind Halboger. Ich bin nur ein Viertel Oger ... wenn's hoch kommt.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed07=<husten> Ich hab einen Frosch im Hals. <Frosch quakt> Hört auf, mich so anzustieren! <bull lowing> Bald gehen die Pferde mit mir durch. <Pferd wiehert> Jetzt reicht's aber mit diesem Affenzirkus! <monkey screeching>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed08=Alles für den Dackel, alles für den Club!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed09=Wie bitte? Nein, wir haben uns nicht verirrt. Ich bin Jäger, ich verlaufe mich nie. Die Wildnis kenne ich wie meine Westenta... Oh! Was ist denn das da drüben?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed10=Sie tut Euch ganz bestimmt nichts! Sie will doch nur spielen. <Brüllen und Beißgeräusch> Oh. Das hat sie noch nie gemacht.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed11=<SFX: Hearthstone Intro music plays> Hm? Öh... Was ich in meiner Freizeit mache, geht nur mich was an.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed12=<SFX: Unleash the Boars plays> Ich liebe diese Karte. <SFX: Attack sounds start playing> <laugh>
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed13=Übrigens, all die Niederlagen, die Ihr gegen Jäger einstecken musstet ... das war ich. Jedes Mal.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed14=<SFX: Hearthstone victory music plays.> So, Pause vorbei. Wo waren wir? Ach ja, ich stecke immer noch in diesem Nexus fest.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Resurrected00=Danke. Jetzt komme ich wieder alleine zurecht.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Resurrected01=Gerade im richtigen Moment.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive00=Ich bin wieder bei Kräften.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive01=Ich vernehme den Ruf der Wildnis.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Revive02=Lasst die Jagd beginnen!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec00=Das wird für den Moment reichen.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec01=Clever.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec02=Eine weise Entscheidung.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec03=Sehr gut.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Spec04=Lok'tar ogar!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt00=Ich bringe Euch zur Strecke!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt01=Wo wähnt Ihr Euch denn vor mir in Sicherheit?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Taunt02=Macht Euch auf etwas gefasst!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/TeamKilled00=Lasst Euch nicht brechen. Darauf sind sie aus.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_ExLocked00=Kraft und Ehre.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Thrall hall!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Gift00=Ich fühle mich überall zuhause.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Lockin00=Ich vernehme den Ruf der Wildnis.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Purchase00=Komm, Misha, die Jagd beginnt.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Trial00=Ich soll also meine Stärke unter Beweis stellen?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_Trial01=Ich kann Euch versichern, dass ich Eure Erwartungen übertreffen werde.

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Wollt Ihr mit mir auf die Jagd?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Das Wandern ist des Jägers Lust ... Geht's bald mal los?
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Misha wird schon ganz unruhig. Und Bären lässt man besser nicht warten.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Vielleicht sollten wir uns auf den Kampf vorbereiten.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ultimate1Used00=Zerreiß sie, Misha!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ultimate1Used01=Auf sie mit Gebrüll!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ultimate1Used02=Lecker Fresschen!
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Ultimate2Used00=Zu mir!

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed03=You have no idea how tough it is to do this in heels.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed04=I have no time for games.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed05=Being undead isn’t all bad. You get to eat whatever or whoever you want and not gain a pound. Although keeping your jaw from falling off, does take some practice... And a little string.

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed13=No I was never in Night Ranger... but I have an all-dead girl group called band-she.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed14=Just keep poking me and see what happens, savage.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed_Evo00=We are... Forsaken.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed_Evo01=My will... my own.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Resurrected00=My undeath continues.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal00=Euch gebührt mein Dank.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ich wurde verschont!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ihr leistet gute Dienste, Heiler.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana00=Mir fehlt Mana.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana01=Ich benötige mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana02=Dafür habe ich nicht genügend Mana.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No00=Ja, schön wär's.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No01=<scoff> Nein.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No02=Nicht mit mir.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Ich schätze, jemand muss unserem Verbündeten helfen.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Steht mir bei!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistMe01=An meine Seite. Sofort!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Trefft sie dort, wo es weh tut. Ihre Zitadelle.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten diese Söldner "rekrutieren".
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Reißt dieses Fort nieder!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Nehmt diesen Beobachtungspunkt ein!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Wenn unsere Zitadelle fällt, sind wir verloren. Verteidigt sie!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Beschützt unser Fort mit Euren erbärmlichen Leben.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Folgt meinem Befehl und beschützt diesen Turm.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_KillHero00=Tötet diesen Möchtegernhelden!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed00=Sind wir denn nicht Sklaven dieser Folter?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed01=Wir sind die Verlassenen.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed02=Macht das noch einmal und Ihr verliert eine Hand.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed03=Ich liege immer auf der _faulen_ Haut.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed04=Schnelligkeit ist gut, aber Präzision ist endgültig.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed05=Ihr wisst ja nicht, wie schwer das hier in Absätzen zu bewerkstelligen ist. Zum Glück sind mir die Nervenenden abgefault.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed06=Ich hab keine Zeit für Spielchen ... und trotzdem finde ich mich andauernd in Spielen wieder. Seltsam ...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed07=Es weiß doch jeder, dass in Unterstadt die besten Schlotternachtspartys steigen.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed08=Eines Tages werd' ich mich rächen. Ich werde Arthas alle Knochen brechen. Dann bin ich ein Star, der alle überlebt. Und dann tut es Euch leid, doch dann ist es zu spät.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed09=Nein. Ich werde nicht für Euch singen. Ich bin die herzlose Herrscherin der Untoten und keine Jukebox.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed10=Ich dachte, ich wäre die Einzige, die von einem grausamen Mann getötet und als mächtiges, aber schreckliches Monster wiederbelebt wurde und sich dann anschließend selbst zur Königin gekrönt hat, um ihre Untergebenen in einen blutigen Rachefeldzug zu führen. Doch dann habe ich Kerrigan getroffen.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed11=Jetzt mal ehrlich, ich war bislang eine Hochelfe, eine Banshee sowie eine untote Hochelfe, aber ich war nie und niemals eine Nachtelfe. Das kommt gar nicht in die Tüte.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed12=<seufz> Nein ... ich laufe nicht nur im Dunkeln durch den Wald.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed13=Wir Klagegeister werden oft umschwirrt von Plagegeistern.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed14=Hoppe, hoppe Reiter, wenn er fällt, dann ... hab ich ihm ins Auge geschossen.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt00=Ich werde Euch Demut lehren.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt01=Verspottet mich als Lebender und Ihr dient mir als Toter.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt02=Ihr gebt eine hübsche Zielscheibe ab.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/TeamKilled00=Verzagt nicht. Ich habe schon Schlimmeres überstanden.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_ExLocked00=Steht zu mir oder fallt vor mir in den Staub.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Die Dunkle Fürstin wacht über Euch.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Sputet Euch.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Kaelthas00=Ha! Zumindest ICH habe einen Thron bestiegen.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=Nein! Und Ihr solltet vor einem Kampf nicht so viel trinken.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Murky00=Das ist nicht Euer Ernst.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Negative00=Hütet Eure Zunge, sonst reiße ich sie heraus.

VoiceOver/Tassadar/LowMana00=Mein Mana geht zur Neige.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/LowMana01=Mein Mana ist zu niedrig.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/LowMana02=Ich benötige mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/No00=Dies ist nicht mein Schicksal.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/No01=Nicht im Rahmen des Möglichen.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/No02=Nein.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter benötigt Beistand.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich benötige Unterstützung.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Ping_AssistMe01=Eilt zu mir, meine Verbündeten!
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Ping_AttackCastle00=Wir sollten uns der gegnerischen Zitadelle zuwenden.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten dieses Söldnerlager angreifen.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Lasst uns dieses Fort vernichten.

VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed01=Euer Wunsch?
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed02=Ich habe keine Zeit für Spielchen ... <Pause> Na gut, eine Runde geht noch.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed03=Und Ihr dachtet, Orcs hätten große Schulterrüstungen ...
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed04=Ich habe den Tod nie gekostet - und ohne Mund wird das wohl auch nicht passieren.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed05=Wir brauchen Verstärkung! Exekutor, holt die Räuber!
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed06=Was? Was soll das heißen: "Es gibt keine Räuber mehr"? Schickt die Dragoner!
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed07=*seufz* Ja was bleibt uns denn dann noch? <Pause> Was bitte ist ein Phasengleiter?
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed08=Videospiele haben sich seit StarCraft 1 deutlich weiterentwickelt. Ich kann die einzelnen Pixel kaum noch erkennen.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed09=Wieso ist "dunkel" eigentlich das Gegenstück zu "hoch"?
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed10=Wenn ich mir das so überlege, vielleicht hätte ich Mar Sara doch direkt einäschern sollen.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed11=En taro <Pause><deprimiert> Tassadar. <seufzt>
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed12=Ich bin überall: Tassahier, Tassada und Tassadort.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed13=Schwarze Magie versperrt uns den Weg ... doch der Wille eines Templers ist stärker.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Pissed14=Glaubt nicht alles, was ihr hört. Psi-Kräfte sind keine "Weltraummagie". Da besteht ein GRAVIERENDER Unterschied.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Resurrected00=Ich kehre zurück.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Resurrected01=Euer Beistand wird hoch geschätzt.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Revive00=Die Khala währt ewig.

VoiceOver/Tassadar/Spec03=Einverstanden.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Spec04=Zweifellos.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Taunt00=Die Feinde der Erstgeborenen werden den Tod finden.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Taunt01=Wer seid Ihr, dass Ihr Euch MIR in den Weg stellt?
VoiceOver/Tassadar/Taunt02=Zittert vor dem Ruhm der Khala.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/TeamKilled00=Ich werde diese Zeit zum Meditieren nutzen.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_ExLocked00=Grüße, seltsames Wesen.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_ExPurchased00=Ehre dem Exekutor.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_Gift00=Wo immer ich gebraucht werde.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_Lockin00=Aus Ordnung folgt Gerechtigkeit.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_Purchase00=Unsere Zeit ist gekommen.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_Trial00=Große Taten beginnen mit kleinen Schritten.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_Trial01=Wir wachsen mit jeder Aufgabe.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_WaitLocked00=Ich stehe bereit.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_WaitLocked01=Unsere Zeit schwindet.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_WaitPurchased00=Meine Meditation ist vollendet. <Pause> Oh, Ihr seid noch hier ...
VoiceOver/Tassadar/UI_WaitPurchased01=Bleibt mit beiden Füßen stets fest auf dem Boden ... Es sei denn, Ihr seid ein Hoher Templer.

VoiceOver/TassadarA/TripleKill02=Dreifachkill.

VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=Lang ist es her, Konkubine der Zerg.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Faszinierend. Was seid Ihr?

VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/IntroResponse_Artanis00=Der Glaube überkommt die Angst, mein Freund.

VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Kill00=Und so endet es.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Kill01=Zu leichtsinnig.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Kill02=Es war vorherbestimmt.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Kill03=Findet Frieden.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Kill04=Schwindet in die Ewigkeit.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/KillArtanis00=Findet Ruhe, junger Exekutor.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/KillBrightwing00=Und was genau seid Ihr?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/KillKerrigan00=Und wenn man das Herz entfernt, stirbt auch der Schwarm.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/KillRaynor00=Es tut mir leid, Raynor, mein Freund.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/KillSpreeEnd00=Das Ende ist immer gewiss.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/KillTassadar00=Ha, eine miserable Kopie.

VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/LowLifeHeal02=Euch gebührt mein ewiger Dank.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/LowMana00=Mein Mana geht zur Neige.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/LowMana01=Mein Mana ist zu niedrig.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/LowMana02=Ich benötige mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/No00=Dies ist nicht mein Schicksal.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/No01=Nicht im Rahmen des Möglichen.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/No02=Nein.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter benötigt Beistand.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich benötige Unterstützung.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ping_AssistMe01=Eilt zu mir, meine Verbündeten!
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ping_AttackCastle00=Wir sollten uns der gegnerischen Zitadelle zuwenden.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten dieses Söldnerlager angreifen.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Lasst uns dieses Fort vernichten.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ping_AttackTower00=Lasst uns diesen Beobachtungspunkt sichern.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unsere Zitadelle.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verteidigt unser Fort!

VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed00=Ja, Exekutor?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed01=Euer Wunsch?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed02=Ich habe keine Zeit für Spielchen ... <Pause> Na gut, eine Runde geht noch.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed03=Und Ihr dachtet, Orcs hätten große Schulterrüstungen ...
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed04=Ich habe den Tod nie gekostet - und ohne Mund wird das wohl auch nicht passieren.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed05=Wir brauchen Verstärkung! Exekutor, holt die Räuber!
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed06=Was? Was soll das heißen: "Es gibt keine Räuber mehr"? Schickt die Dragoner!
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed07=*seufz* Ja was bleibt uns denn dann noch? <Pause> Was bitte ist ein Phasengleiter?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed08=Videospiele haben sich seit StarCraft 1 deutlich weiterentwickelt. Ich kann die einzelnen Pixel kaum noch erkennen.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed09=Wieso ist "dunkel" eigentlich das Gegenstück zu "hoch"?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed10=Wenn ich mir das so überlege, vielleicht hätte ich Mar Sara doch direkt einäschern sollen.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed11=En taro <Pause><deprimiert> Tassadar. <seufzt>
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed12=Ich bin überall: Tassahier, Tassada und Tassadort.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed13=Schwarze Magie versperrt uns den Weg ... doch der Wille eines Templers ist stärker.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed14=Glaubt nicht alles, was ihr hört. Psi-Kräfte sind keine "Weltraummagie". Da besteht ein GRAVIERENDER Unterschied.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Resurrected00=Ich kehre zurück.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Resurrected01=Euer Beistand wird hoch geschätzt.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Revive00=Die Khala währt ewig.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Revive01=Khala'dor-ah.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Revive02=Das Licht der Gerechtigkeit scheint einmal mehr.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec00=Es war vorherbestimmt.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec01=Eine folgenschwere Entscheidung.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec02=Za'thun kalinar.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec03=Einverstanden.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec04=Zweifellos.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Taunt00=Die Feinde der Erstgeborenen werden den Tod finden.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Taunt01=Wer seid Ihr, dass Ihr Euch MIR in den Weg stellt?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Taunt02=Zittert vor dem Ruhm der Khala.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/TeamKilled00=Ich werde diese Zeit zum Meditieren nutzen.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_ExLocked00=Grüße, seltsames Wesen.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_ExPurchased00=Ehre dem Exekutor.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_Gift00=Wo immer ich gebraucht werde.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_Lockin00=Aus Ordnung folgt Gerechtigkeit.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_Purchase00=Unsere Zeit ist gekommen.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_Trial00=Große Taten beginnen mit kleinen Schritten.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_Trial01=Wir wachsen mit jeder Aufgabe.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_WaitLocked00=Ich stehe bereit.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_WaitLocked01=Unsere Zeit schwindet.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_WaitPurchased00=Meine Meditation ist vollendet. <Pause> Oh, Ihr seid noch hier ...
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_WaitPurchased01=Bleibt mit beiden Füßen stets fest auf dem Boden ... Es sei denn, Ihr seid ein Hoher Templer.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ultimate1Used00=Barriere errichtet!

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroBoast01=Nichts und niemand wird uns aufhalten!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion00=Seid Ihr bereit?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion01=Die Schlacht erwartet uns. Ich hoffe, Ihr seid bereit ...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Falstad00=Seid Ihr bereit, den Schicksalshammer in Aktion zu erleben, Zwerg?

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hmm, was er damit wohl sagen will ...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Bald hat das Warten ein Ende. Ebenso Euer Geschwätz, hoffe ich.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Lasst uns für den Ruhm der Horde kämpfen!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Rehgar00=Warum so förmlich? Das passt nicht zu Euch, Rehgar.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Rexxar00=Kommt, Champion. Die Schlacht erwartet uns.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Das sagt Ihr so einfach. Beweist es mir!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill00=Hier ereilt Euch Euer Schicksal!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill01=Ein weiterer Feind der Horde liegt im Staub.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill02=Die Erde verschlingt Euch!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill03=Euer Kampf ist vorüber.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill04=Auf Nimmerwiedersehen.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillArthas00=Eure Herrschaft ist vorbei.

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal00=Euer Kriegshäuptling dankt Euch.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal01=Genau zur richtigen Zeit, Heiler.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ich spüre, wie meine Kräfte zurückkehren.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana00=Ich habe nur noch wenig Mana.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana01=Ich benötige mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana02=Mein Mana ist niedrig.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No00=Unmöglich.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No01=Nein.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No02=Verschwendet nicht meine Zeit.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter braucht Hilfe.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Helft mir, schnell!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Ich brauche Verstärkung!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zerstört ihre Zitadelle! Lok'tar!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten diese Söldner rekrutieren.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Krieger, greift dieses Fort an.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Lasst uns diesen Beobachtungspunkt sichern.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Beschützt unsere Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verliert keine Zeit! Wir müssen unser Fort verteidigen.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Beschützt diesen Beobachtungspunkt, Krieger!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_KillHero00=Tötet diesen Helden! Schnell!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed00=Ich bin der Kriegshäuptling.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed01=Die Geister sind ruhelos.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed02=Hmm? Oh, richtig ... Ich soll etwas Lustiges sagen. Entschuldigt, mein komödiantisches Talent ist leider etwas eingerostet.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed03=<atmet tief ein> Ach, ich vermisse die gute alte Echtzeitstrategie.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed04=Die isometrische Perspektive, die epischen Schlachten ...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed05=Ständig gepikst zu werden habe ich aber nicht vermisst ...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed06=Erde! Feuer! Wind! Wasser! Liebe ... Moment, irgendwas stimmt hier nicht... Und überhaupt, warum habe ich plötzlich diese Melodie im Ohr?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed07=Ein Priester, ein Mönch und ein Medizinmann kommen in eine Bar. Der Barkeeper schaut sie an und sagt: Soll das ein Witz sein?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed08=Ihr macht mich wütend! Ihr würdet mich nicht mögen, wenn ich wütend bin!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed09=Hört auf Euren Kriegshäuptling ... Macht nichts, was Ihr später bereuen werdet, nur weil irgendjemand "Für die Horde" brüllt.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed10=Und ein für alle Mal: Es heißt Thrall, ok? Th-th-th-th-Thrall, nicht Srall, nicht Trall und erst recht nicht Vrall!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed11=Schaun wir doch mal, welche Fähigkeiten sie mir diesmal verpasst haben ... Oh, Kettenblitz ... immer gut. Wildgeist ... Windzorn ... Ha, Rehgar, sieht so aus, als hätte ich alle guten Sachen abgekriegt.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed12=Ich seh es schon kommen: Nach ein paar Erweiterungen von Heroes of the Storm ersetzt Blizzard mich durch Garrosh.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed13=Der Hieb, der Orgrim getötet hat, hat eine Delle in der Rückenplatte dieser Rüstung hinterlassen. Sie erinnert mich stets wieder daran, dass der Feind immer dort zuschlagen kann, wo man es am wenigsten erwartet.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed14=Moment mal! Dieses Spiel hat wirklich eine Hintergrundgeschichte? Soll das heißen, da wurde jemand dafür bezahlt, eine Story zu schreiben, die erklärt wie Raynor auf Diablo trifft? Gibt es dafür nicht Fanfiction? <Seufzt> Mich hat mal wieder niemand gefragt.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Resurrected00=Ich danke Euch.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Resurrected01=Wie gut, jemanden wie Euch in der Nähe zu haben.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive00=Die Horde wird niemals untergehen.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive01=Lok'tar ogar!

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec04=Ja, ich fühle wie meine Kräfte zurückkehren.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt00=Die Elemente werden Euch vernichten.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt01=Ich bin der Zorn der Horde!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt02=Stellt Euch dem Sohn Durotans!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/TeamKilled00=Unser Kampfgeist ist ungebrochen.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_ExLocked00=Lok'tar.

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Gift00=Euer Verbündeter ist auch der meine.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Lockin00=Ruhm der Horde!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Purchase00=Für die Horde!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Trial00=Also gut, lasst mich Euch zeigen, wie das gemacht wird.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Trial01=Ich werde Euch das nur einmal zeigen, also schaut genau zu.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Lasst mich Euch die wahre Macht der Elemente zeigen.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Wir können es uns nicht leisten, weiter Zeit zu verschwenden. Wir haben eine Schlacht zu schlagen.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Was dauert denn nur so lange?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ihr habt schon verstanden, dass ich der KRIEGShäuptling bin, oder?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used00=Lernt die Wut des Schicksalshammers kennen!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used01=Genug!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used02=Die Elemente erheben sich, um Euch zu zerschmettern!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used03=Meine Geduld ist erschöpft!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used00=Erde, verschlinge meine Feinde!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used01=Erbebt vor Furcht!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used02=Die Erde selbst ist mein Verbündeter!

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed08=Ihr macht mich wütend! Ihr würdet mich nicht mögen, wenn ich wütend bin!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed09=Hört auf Euren Kriegshäuptling ... Macht nichts, was Ihr später bereuen werdet, nur weil irgendjemand "Für die Horde" brüllt.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed10=Und ein für alle Mal: Es heißt Thrall, ok? Th-th-th-th-Thrall, nicht Srall, nicht Trall und erst recht nicht Vrall!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed11=Schaun wir doch mal, welche Fähigkeiten sie mir diesmal verpasst haben ... Oh, Kettenblitz ... immer gut. Wildgeist ... Windzorn ... Ha, Rehgar, sieht so aus, als hätte ich alle guten Sachen abgekriegt.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed12=Ich seh es schon kommen: Nach ein paar Erweiterungen von Heroes of the Storm ersetzt Blizzard mich durch Garrosh.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed13=Der Hieb, der Orgrim getötet hat, hat eine Delle in der Rückenplatte dieser Rüstung hinterlassen. Sie erinnert mich stets wieder daran, dass der Feind immer dort zuschlagen kann, wo man es am wenigsten erwartet.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed14=Moment mal! Dieses Spiel hat wirklich eine Hintergrundgeschichte? Soll das heißen, da wurde jemand dafür bezahlt, eine Story zu schreiben, die erklärt wie Raynor auf Diablo trifft? Gibt es dafür nicht Fanfiction? <Seufzt> Mich hat mal wieder niemand gefragt.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Resurrected00=Ich danke Euch.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Resurrected01=Wie gut, jemanden wie Euch in der Nähe zu haben.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeEnd00=War das alles?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeEnd01=Ihr habt versagt.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeEnd02=Dachtet Ihr tatsächlich, Ihr würdet ungestraft davonkommen?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeStart00=Stellt Euch dem Kriegshäuptling der Horde!

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_Trial00=Also gut, lasst mich Euch zeigen, wie das gemacht wird.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_Trial01=Ich werde Euch das nur einmal zeigen, also schaut genau zu.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitLocked00=Lasst mich Euch die wahre Macht der Elemente zeigen.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitLocked01=Wir können es uns nicht leisten, weiter Zeit zu verschwenden. Wir haben eine Schlacht zu schlagen.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitPurchased00=Was dauert denn nur so lange?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ihr habt schon verstanden, dass ich der KRIEGShäuptling bin, oder?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used00=Lernt die Wut des Schicksalshammers kennen!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used01=Genug!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used02=Die Elemente erheben sich, um Euch zu zerschmettern!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used03=Meine Geduld ist erschöpft!

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate2Used01=Erbebt vor Furcht!

VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroAgree01=Wir verstehen uns.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroAgree02=Da mach ich mit.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroBoast00=Stiften wir ein bisschen Unruhe!
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroBoast01=Diese Penner begeben sich in eine Welt des Schmerzes.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion00=Seid ihr bereit, in ein paar Ärsche zu treten?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion01=Hoffe, ihr seid bereit, es krachen zu lassen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_Alarak00=Ein Tal'darim? Was ist los? Waren dir Blau und Gold nicht Goth genug?

VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_Protoss00=Protoss. <ironisch> Ich kann mich vor Freude kaum halten.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_Raynor00=Wie in alten Zeiten, was, Partner?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_SiegeTank00=Schau an, die kleine Hammer. Lassen die dich das Ding immer noch fahren?

VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_Terran00=Haah! Endlich jemand, dem ich hier vertrauen kann.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_Zarya00=Haha! Gut, dass ich hier nicht der Einzige bin, der richtig zupacken kann.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=An der Seite von Zerg zu kämpfen, passt mir ganz und gar nicht.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroRespond00=Na klar, Partner.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroRespond01=Heh, wird auch höchste Zeit.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroRespond02=Ich mach einfach, was mir in den Kram passt.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Alarak00=Ey! Ich BIN brauchbar. Und du brauchst gleich 'ne Bahre!
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Ana00=Hä? Was?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Angry00=Partner, dafür entschuldigst du dich jetzt besser, sonst hat der Arsch Kirmes.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Bored00=<schnarcht> Öööh, was?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_DVa00=Na logo! Nur äh ... Was zur Hölle ist ein Selfie?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Dein Gelaber geht mir am Arsch vorbei ...
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Excited00=Verdammt, wurde aber auch Zeit.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=<kichert> Mach ich dich nervös, Baby? Keine Sorge, bei mir werden nicht nur DEINE Knie weich.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_KerriganGhost00=Ich kann es auch nicht fassen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Laughter00=<mocking laugh>
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Morales00=Wenn ich jetzt doch nur noch meine Stimpacks hätte ...
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hä? Was?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Negative00=Ich kann es auch nicht fassen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Nova00=Dafür wandern meine Augen aber VIEL zu gerne.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Positive00=<kichert> Auch schön, dich zu sehen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Probius00=Für'n Toaster bist du ganz schön vorlaut, oder?
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Protoss00=Meine Fresse, ihr Protoss seid ja solche Spaßbremsen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Raynor00=Jup. Wie in alten Zeiten.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_SiegeTank00=<kichert> Nein.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Stukov00=Junge, ihr Erd-Typen habt doch alle einen Dachschaden.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Stupid00=So einen Blödsinn habe ich schon lange nicht mehr gehört.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Terran00=Ach, auf den alten Tychus kannst du dich verlassen ... meistens.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Warfield00=Zum Glück halten wir zusammen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Zarya00=Klar, wenn ich dafür mit dem Laserding da mal rumballern darf.
VoiceOver/Tychus/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Ja, ja, bringen wir's endlich hinter uns.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Kill00=Tot gefällst du mir besser.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Kill01=Oh! Da ist mir doch glatt was vor die Flinte gelaufen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Kill02=Hm, der Tod steht dir echt gut.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Kill03=Wie du mir, so ich dir.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Kill04=Das könnte ich den GAAANZEN Tag machen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillArthas00=Schicke Rüstung ... Leider hilft sie einen Scheiß.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillBrightwing00=Bwah ... Beschissenes Drachenviech ...
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillChogall00=Zwei Köpfe ... und nix drin.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillDiablo00=Was sagt man dazu? Selbst der Teufel kann bluten.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillKerrigan00=Und diesmal rettet dich niemand ...
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillLiLi00=Hab grad nicht aufgepasst ... War das ein Panda?
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillLucio00=Junge, von deinem Gedudel bluten mir ja die Ohren.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillLunara00=Das wird meine neue Kühlerfigur.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillNinja00=Ha! Da hab ich doch tatsächlich grad einen Ninja umgenietet. Das erlebt man auch nicht alle Tage.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillRaynor00=<hust> Für den meistgesuchten Mann im Sektor - bist du nicht wirklich schwer zu töten.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillSpreeEnd00=<kichert> Und wo war da jetzt das Problem?
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillSupport00=Der Heiler ist weg. Jetzt kann der Spaß losgehen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillThrall00=Dicker Hammer, nix dahinter. Hehehe.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillTychus00=Nur weil du genauso hübsch bist, kannst du noch lange nicht so kämpfen wie ich.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillWarrior00=Bumm! Es hat sich ausgetankt!
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillZagara00=Ich schwöre, diese Zerg werden immer widerlicher.
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillZerg00=Es gibt nichts Schöneres als das Geräusch zermatschter Zerg. <lacht>
VoiceOver/Tychus/KillZuljin00=Friss das! Du Troll!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Tychus/Laugh01=<gluckst>
VoiceOver/Tychus/Laugh02=<gluckst>

VoiceOver/Tychus/Laugh06=<gluckst>
VoiceOver/Tychus/LowLifeHeal00=Da hab ich kurz rot gesehen ... Danke.
VoiceOver/Tychus/LowLifeHeal01=Genau was der Arzt verschrieben hat.
VoiceOver/Tychus/LowLifeHeal02=Mann, bin ich froh, dass es dich gibt.
VoiceOver/Tychus/LowMana00=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/Tychus/LowMana01=Dieses komische Manazeug geht mir aus.
VoiceOver/Tychus/LowMana02=Ich hab fast kein Mana mehr, Partner.
VoiceOver/Tychus/No00=Wie wär's mit ... "nein"!
VoiceOver/Tychus/No01=Ich bin grad beschäftigt.
VoiceOver/Tychus/No02=Hehe, ja, das kannst du dir abschminken.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Odin_End00=<seufzt> Kurz, aber lustig.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Odin_End01=Vermiss dich jetzt schon, Baby.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Odin_End02=So ist das mit der wahren Liebe. Sie währt niemals ewig.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AssistHero00=Mag mal jemand unserem Amigo beistehen?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AssistMe00=Zieht mal den Kopf aus'm Arsch und helft mir.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AssistMe01=Muss ich denn alles alleine machen?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AttackCastle00=Stampfen wir ihre Zitadelle ein.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten uns dieses Söldnerlager zur Brust nehmen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Wie wär's wenn wir eins ihrer Forts kaputt machen?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_AttackTower00=Vielleicht sollten wir uns diesen Beobachtungspunkt schnappen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unser Schätzchen!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Das Fort beschützen wir besser.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir müssen diesen Beobachtungspunkt verteidigen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Ping_KillHero00=Da möchte jemand eins aufs Maul.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed00=Ich bin ein böser Junge.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed01=Willst du noch weiter bellen, kleines Hündchen, oder willst du beißen?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed02=Wenn du deine Hand in den Käfig steckst, dann wunder dich nicht, wenn du gebissen wirst.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed03=Du gehst mir langsam auf die Nerven.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed04=Tja, ich bin nicht so der Teamspieler. Besonders nicht, wenn das Team aus Kuhmenschen und Zombies und so'm widerlichen Scheiß besteht.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed05=Die könnten mich zwischen den Schlachten zumindest mal aus meinem Anzug lassen. Hier drin fängt es langsam an zu müffeln.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed06=Bwah. Riecht nach Leberwurst und Tabak.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed07=<lacht> Ich liebe es, wenn ein Plan ... Oh <piep>, <piep>, die verdammte Zigarre ist mir in den Anz... Oh <piep> Ah! Au! Moment, ah okay, jetzt ist sie aus. <schnüffelt> Schwein gehabt, nichts verbrannt. Alles gut, Leute, beruhigt euch wieder.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed08=Man sagt, ausgefallene Dinge schreien geradezu nach Vandalismus ... und das andere Team sieht für mich ziemlich ausgefallen aus.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed09=Lehn dich einfach zurück und lass mich mal machen.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed10=Die dümmsten Soldaten fangen die dicksten Kugeln.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed11=Noch so'n Stuss, Kieferschuss!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed12=Warst du schon mal in einer Kaserne? Sagen wir einfach, es gibt einen Grund, warum Marines lieber sterben, als dorthin zurückzukehren.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed13=<schnarcht> Ich hab dich lieb, Mutti. <schnarcht> Mutti ... <wacht auf> WAS? Hey! Hat dir niemand gesagt, dass man schlafende Hunde nicht wecken sollte?
VoiceOver/Tychus/Pissed14=Also ... wie ist das jetzt mit diesem "Nexus"? Wir bekämpfen uns einfach bis in alle Ewigkeit? Na daran könnt ich mich gewöhnen!
VoiceOver/Tychus/Resurrected00=Schön, dass du vorbeigekommen bist.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Resurrected01=Gut aufgepasst, Partner.
VoiceOver/Tychus/Revive00=Tja, <atmet aus> das tat echt weh ...

VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed12=Einige Mechas haben die Fähigkeit, sich mit anderen Mechas zu einem noch gewaltigeren Supermecha zusammenzuschließen. Leider nur während der letzten 2 Minuten einer Schlacht, das ist ein bekannter Konstruktionsfehler.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed13=Mecha-Tassadar ist eine Legende! Jeder Mech unserer Serie hat seine größten Kämpfe in seiner internen Datenbank gespeichert. Am besten gefällt mir, wie er im Kampf gegen Lurkablo einen Raumtanker als Knüppel eingesetzt hat.

VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Attack00=Greift jetzt an! Der Gegner ist schwach!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Attack01=Der Feind ist geschwächt! Schlagt zu, meine Krieger!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Attack02=Greift an und zeigt ihnen keine Gnade!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Caution00=Seid vorsichtig.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_GoodJob00=Gut gekämpft.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_GoodJob01=Ein hervorragendes Manöver.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_GoodJob02=Eure Leidenschaft im Kampf ist beeindruckend.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Heal00=Eure Wunden sind tief. Schnell, begebt Euch zu einem Heilbrunnen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Heal01=Ich an Eurer Stelle würde einen Heilbrunnen aufsuchen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Retreat00=Rückzug ist kein Zeichen der Schwäche, sondern Strategie.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Retreat01=Ich ziehe mich zurück, um später erneut anzugreifen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Uhoh00=Ein schmerzlicher Verlust.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Uhoh01=Oh nein.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/AI_Uhoh02=Es tut mir leid.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Attack00=Tor ilisar'thera'nal!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Attack01=Der Zorn der Göttin treffe Euch!

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Attack05=Ich habe Euch im Visier.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Attack06=Im Namen von Elune!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Celebrate00=Gut gemacht, meine Verbündeten!

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Death02=<Todesröcheln>
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Healed00=Die Göttin segne Eure Hand.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Healed01=Meisterhafte Heilung.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Healed02=Ich danke Euch.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroAgree00=Ich stimme absolut zu.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroAgree01=Niemand besteht gegen die Kaldorei!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroAgree02=Tod allen Feinden der Wildnis!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroBoast00=Unsere Feinde sollten sich in Acht nehmen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroBoast01=Die Göttin wacht über uns!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroQuestion00=Seid Ihr bereit für die Jagd?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroQuestion01=Ich hoffe, Ihr seid bereit für das, was uns bevorsteht.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroQuestion_Illidan00=Dich zu befreien war mein größter Fehler ...
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=Bist du bereit, Liebster?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Der Nexus hat einen Murloc auserwählt?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Die Göttin stellt meine Entschlossenheit auf die Probe ...
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Es erfreut mein Herz, Euch erneut zu begegnen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroRespond00=Eine Schildwache ist immer bereit.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroRespond01=Seid Ihr es denn?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroRespond02=Natürlich.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroResponse_Ana00=Ich bin mehr als 10.000 Jahre alt, aber habe es immer noch drauf.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroResponse_Illidan00=Ich habe keine Zeit für deine Betrügereien, Illidan.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=Glaubst du immer noch, mit mir mithalten zu können?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroResponse_Murky00=Macht Euch bereit, junger Streiter.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroResponse_Negative00=Es ist einfacher, wenn wir Verbündete bleiben. Seht zu, dass ich mir das nicht anders überlege.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroResponse_Positive00=Gemeinsam ist uns der Sieg gewiss.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/IntroResponse_Warning00=<Do not record. Reuses a RevengeStart line.>
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Kill00=So geschieht den Feinden der Schildwachen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Kill01=Lauft das nächste Mal schneller.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Kill02=Dies ist das Ende!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Kill03=Möge die Göttin sich Eurer annehmen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Kill04=Findet Frieden.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillDemon00=Diese Welt steht unter meinem Schutz, Dämon.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillFairyDragon00=Bedauerlich, ein Kind Yseras zu töten.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillIllidan00=Oh, Illidan. Möge der Tod dir Frieden bringen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillKaelthas00=Ihr beschmutzt den Namen "Sonnenwanderer", Kind.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillMalfurion00=Mein Liebster, vergib mir.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillSiegeTank00=Nicht einmal Gnome würden solch eine Monstrosität erschaffen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillSpreeEnd00=Ich bin Euch überlegen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/KillSylvanas00=Übt noch ein weiteres Jahrtausend ... dann seid Ihr mir vielleicht ebenbürtig.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowLifeHeal00=Ihr habt mein Leben gerettet.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowLifeHeal01=Ich stehe für immer in Eurer Schuld.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowLifeHeal02=Ihr habt die Dunkelheit abgewehrt. Dafür danke ich Euch.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowMana00=Mein Mana geht zur Neige.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowMana01=Mein Mana schwindet.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/LowMana02=Ich benötige zusätzliches Mana.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/No00=Dem kann ich nicht Folge leisten.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/No01=Ihr verlangt etwas Unmögliches.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/No02=Das ist nicht möglich.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter benötigt Hilfe!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich benötige Hilfe.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AssistMe01=Schnell, zu mir!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AttackCastle00=Freunde, lasst uns die gegnerische Zitadelle angreifen!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AttackMerc00=Lasst uns dieses Söldnerlager einnehmen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Dieses Fort muss fallen!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_AttackTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt sichern.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unsere Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Wir sollten dieses Fort verteidigen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt verteidigen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ping_KillHero00=Wir müssen dem Tun dieses Helden ein Ende setzen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed00=Die Göttin ruft.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed01=Anu'therador mali.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed02=Nur, weil ich eine Priesterin bin, heißt das noch lange nicht, dass ich meinen Zorn beständig im Zaum halte.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed03=Hier, haltet mal diesen Apfel ... Gut, und jetzt legt ihn Euch auf den Kopf. Perfekt. Ist schon ein Weilchen her, seit ich mit diesem Bogen geschossen habe. <Pfeilgeräusch>
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed04=Dies ist meine Eule. Es gibt viele andere, aber diese ... enttarnt Gegner.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed05=Nächste Woche feiere ich meinen 29. Geburtstag. Zum 10.000. Mal.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed06=Hat irgendjemand meine Katze gesehen? Es scheint mir schon Jahre her zu sein, dass sie mir zuletzt untergekommen ist. Komm, Miez, Miez, Miez!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed07=Einst, als die Frauen in Kalimdor herrschten, war es eine friedliche Welt. Dann sind die Männer aufgewacht und jetzt haben wir alle paar Jahre Krieg.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed08=<Türklingel> Guten Tag, ich bin Tyrande und dies ist Schwester Shandris. Wir würden gern ein wenig mit Ihnen über Elune sprechen. Hier, bitte werfen Sie auch einen Blick in unsere Broschüre. <Tür wird zugeknallt> Oh. Hallo?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed09=Was zum ... Wie lange schon habe ich diese Blätter im Haar? Wieso sagt mir das denn niemand?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed10=Ich bin Hohepriesterin Tyrande, Verfechterin der Gerechtigkeit. Im Namen Elunes werde ich Euch bestrafen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed11=Göttin, lasst mich schnell und akkurat schießen und niemals mein Ziel verfehlen. Und solltet Ihr mich heute tatsächlich zu Euch rufen, so mögen zuerst all meine Pfeile ihr Ziel gefunden haben.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed12=Wär mal wieder Zeit für ein Wellness-Jahrtausend oder zwei ...
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed13=In unserer Beziehung halten Malfurion und ich uns an eine grundlegende Regel: kein Gestaltwandeln! Da stehe ich einfach nicht drauf ...
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed14=Gute Nacht, Pflanzen. Gute Nacht, Wanzen. Gute Nacht, ihr Wogen, und gute Nacht, mein Bogen. Gute Nacht, Rebhuhn, und gute Nacht, Elune.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Resurrected00=Es gibt viel zu tun.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Resurrected01=Ich stehe in Eurer Schuld.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Revive00=Göttin, gebt mir Kraft.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Revive01=Dieser Kampf hat gerade erst begonnen!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Revive02=Schnell, auf in den Kampf!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec00=Eine großzügige Gabe.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec01=Da sind wir uns wohl einig.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec02=Wie die Göttin wünscht.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec03=Eine große Gunst.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Spec04=Das scheint mir nützlich.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt00=Möge die Göttin Euch Gnade gewähren – ich werde es sicherlich nicht tun!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt01=Ihr werdet Eure Unverfrorenheit bereuen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Taunt02=Ihr glaubt, ich hätte Angst vor Euch? Da muss ich Euch enttäuschen ...
VoiceOver/Tyrande/TeamKilled00=Habt Geduld ... Unsere Zeit wird kommen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_ExLocked00=Ishnu-alah.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_ExPurchased00=Elune erleuchte Euren Weg.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_Gift00=Ich gehe, wohin die Göttin wünscht.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_Lockin00=Ich folge der Stimme Elunes.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_Purchase00=Eine weise Entscheidung.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_Trial00=Ich bin bereit.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_Trial01=Eine einfache Aufgabe.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_WaitLocked00=Soll ich Euch vielleicht zeigen, wozu ich fähig bin?
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_WaitLocked01=Wir sollten uns der Jagd anschließen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ich bin sowohl eine Priesterin als auch eine Kriegerin. Es ist unklug, mich derart zu beäugen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ich bin keine Questgeberin mehr und habe entsprechend besseres zu tun, als hier herumzustehen ...
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ultimate1Used00=Elune verberge Euch!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ultimate1Used01=Wir werden eins mit dem Schatten!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ultimate2Used00=Spürt den Zorn der Himmel!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Ultimate2Used01=Das Licht der Göttin verbrenne Euch!

VoiceOver/Tyrande/WorthIt01=Ein angemessener Preis.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes00=Bei Elune.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes01=So sei es.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes02=Wir sollten uns beeilen.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes03=Wie die Göttin wünscht.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes04=Anu'dorah!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes05=Sofort.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes06=Ohne zu zögern.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes07=Vorwärts.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes08=Ja, natürlich.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Attack00=Greift jetzt an! Der Feind ist geschwächt!
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Attack01=Nutzt unseren Vorteil!
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Attack02=Jetzt ist der Zeitpunkt zum Zuschlagen!
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Caution00=Seid vorsichtig.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_GoodJob00=Ausgezeichnete Arbeit!
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_GoodJob01=Gut gemacht.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_GoodJob02=Eine beherzte Tat!
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Heal00=Ihr habt einiges abbekommen. Trinkt von einem Heilbrunnen!
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Heal01=Ich an Eurer Stelle wäre auf dem schnellsten Weg zu einem Heilbrunnen.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Retreat00=Ich muss mich zurückziehen.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Retreat01=Ich verlasse vorübergehend die Front.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh00=Eine solche Schande.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh01=Menschenskind!
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh02=Verzweifelt nicht!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack00=Für Lordaeron!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack01=Greift mit aller Macht an!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack02=Möge das Licht Euch verfluchen!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack03=Für die Silberne Hand!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack04=Feinde des Lichts, nehmt Euch in Acht!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack05=Das Licht ist mit uns!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack06=Ich bin der Hammer der Gerechtigkeit!
VoiceOver/Uther/Celebrate00=Genau so!
VoiceOver/Uther/Celebrate01=Nur weiter so!
VoiceOver/Uther/Comeback00=Wir holen auf! Jetzt nicht nachlassen!
VoiceOver/Uther/Death00=<Todesröcheln>
VoiceOver/Uther/Death01=<Todesröcheln>
VoiceOver/Uther/Death02=<Todesröcheln>
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed00=Das Licht ist Euer Verbündeter.
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed01=Habt Dank.
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed02=Eine sehr gute Heilung!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree00=Ich kämpfe an Eurer Seite.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree01=Ihr habt meine Zustimmung.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree02=Richtig so!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroBoast00=Das Licht wird uns zum Sieg führen!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroBoast01=Wir kämpfen mit Ehre!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion00=Zeigen wir es ihnen!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion01=Seid Ihr bereit?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=Es ist immer eine Ehre, mit anderen Soldaten der Allianz zu kämpfen.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Warum sollte ich Euch trauen, Junge?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Ihr seid also dieser "Kreuzritter", von dem ich so viel gehört habe. Und mit Euch soll ich kämpfen?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Greymane00=Genn Graumähne höchstpersönlich. Es wurde auch Zeit, dass sich Gilneas wieder dem Kampf anschließt.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Oh, Ihr seid von der Horde ... Dabei hätte heute so ein schöner Tag werden können.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Impressed00=Hm, Ihr scheint etwas Kampferfahrung zu haben.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Lady Jaina, ich bin erfreut, erneut an Eurer Seite zu kämpfen.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Ihr seid der Skelettkönig? Das trifft den Nagel auf den Kopf.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Light00=<Do not record. Reuses Pissed01>
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_LightVictory00=Das Licht wird uns zum Sieg führen!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Medic00=Ha! Seid gegrüßt, werte Verbündete!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Was hat es eigentlich mit Euch auf sich?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Ein Totenbeschwörer? Ich gebe zu, ich kann mich für Euren Schlag nicht erwärmen.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Negative00=<hust> Dann wohl mit Euch ...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Hallo! Was meint Ihr? Wollen wir die Gerechtigkeit walten lassen?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Stitches00=Beim Licht! Was für eine Monstrosität seid Ihr?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Sylvanas? <beat> Ihr seht grauenhaft aus.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Varian! Das letzte Mal, als ich Euch sah, wart Ihr noch ein Welpe.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Kommt das nur mir so vor oder werdet Ihr Zerg immer seltsamer?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zuljin00=Ihr seid also der mächtige Zul'jin. Hm. Besonders beeindruckend seht Ihr nicht aus.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond00=Ich bin immer bereit.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond01=Mit Vergnügen.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond02=Beim Licht!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Ruhm der Allianz!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Angry00=Das hat Euch gerade eine Heilung gekostet. Und zwar gerade dann, wenn Ihr sie am nötigsten brauchen würdet.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Haltet den Mund, bevor ich ihn Euch stopfe.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Butcher00=So viel zu meinem Trommelfell ...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Cranky00=Zu meiner Zeit respektierte man die Älteren. BESONDERS wenn sie Heiler waren!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Bitte ... Ich habe schon dem Licht gedient, da habt Ihr noch Windeln getragen.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Ja, ja, Ihr seid von der ganz harten Sorte, wir haben es begriffen. Können wir jetzt beginnen?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Excited00=Ha! Das wird ein Kampf für die Geschichtsbücher!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Greymane00=Ha, ich bin froh, das zu hören, alter Hund. <beat> Oh, tut mir leid.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Horde00=Nur weil Ihr jetzt die "NEUE" Horde seid, heißt das nicht, dass Euch Eure Sünden erlassen wurden.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Impressed00=Hm! Dann zeigt mal, was Ihr draufhabt.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Die Schuld ist die meine, und sie wird mich bis an mein Lebensende begleiten.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Kein Wunder, dass Euch Eure eigenen Leute getötet haben.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Medic00=Wa... welcher Teil? Die riesigen Adlerschulterpanzer? Oder ist es mein magischer Erste-Hilfe-Hammer?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Euch bezeichnen sie als Helden? Ha. Ich habe schon Schlamm von meinen Stiefeln gekratzt, der heroischer war als Ihr.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Murky00=Wie bitte? Könntet Ihr das noch mal wiederholen?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Wisst Ihr, Ihr erinnert mich an jemanden ...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Negative00=Haltet einfach den Mund. Wir haben eine Schlacht zu gewinnen.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NewRace00=Ihr seid aus Azeroth? Da verlässt man einmal für ein paar Jährchen den Planeten und schon geht alles den Bach runter.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NightElf00=Und ich dachte, Hochelfen wären eingebildet.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ha! Zeigen wir diesen Bastarden, wo der Hammer hängt.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Stitches00=Das ist keiner Antwort wert.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Mit Euch ist wohl auch Eure gute Laune gestorben.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Uncaring00=Oh, Ihr denkt, dass ich auch nur den geringsten Wert auf Eure Meinung lege? Ha. Das ist ja allerhand.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Varian00=Für die Allianz!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Vergesst bloß nicht, auf wessen Seite Ihr kämpft, Kreatur.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zuljin00=Ja. Genau die Art Kommentar habe ich von einem Troll erwartet.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill00=Der Gerechtigkeit wurde Genüge getan.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill01=Geht in das Licht ... jetzt!
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill02=Dies ist Euer Ende.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill03=Es ist vollbracht.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill04=Ihr wehrt Euch ja nicht mal richtig!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAlliance00=Bitte verzeiht mir, Freund.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAngel00=Hmm. Habe ich gerade eine Geistheilerin getötet?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillArthas00=Schmort in der Hölle, Junge.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillChogall00=Es scheint, als stünden Paladine und Ogermagier doch nicht auf einer Stufe.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillCrusader00=Oh ... seid Ihr etwa doch nicht mehr eine Klasse für Euch?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDemon00=Zurück in den Nether mit Euch! Oder wo auch immer Ihr hergekommen seid.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDiablo00=In dieser Welt ist kein Platz für Euch und Euresgleichen, Dämon!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillGuldan00=Nicht einmal die "Inkarnation der Dunkelheit" hält dem Licht stand.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillHorde00=Neue Horde, gleiches Gesindel.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillJaina00=<seufzt> Sehr bedauerlich ...
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKaelthas00=Ihr müsst noch viel lernen, Kael'thas.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKerrigan00=Es ist Zeit für Gerechtigkeit, Kerrigan.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillMedivh00=Was Lothars Klinge begann, hat mein Kriegshammer zu Ende gebracht.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillPaladin00=Möge das Licht Eurer Seele gnädig sein.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillRaynor00=Scheint, als hättet Ihr bei der Einführung nicht aufgepasst, Raynor.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillScourge00=Solange ich am Leben bin, wird Lordaeron niemals der schändlichen Geißel erliegen.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillSpreeEnd00=Netter Versuch!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillVarian00=Was soll ich noch mal sagen?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillWar200=Ah, da kommen Erinnerungen hoch.
VoiceOver/Uther/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal00=Gut, dass es Euch gibt.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal01=Ich schulde Euch mein Leben.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal02=Ich werde Euch ewig dankbar sein.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana00=Ich habe nur noch wenig Mana.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana01=Mein Mana geht zur Neige.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana02=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/Uther/No00=Nein.
VoiceOver/Uther/No01=Das ist nicht möglich.
VoiceOver/Uther/No02=Das kann ich nicht.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistHero00=Unser Verbündeter benötigt Hilfe.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich könnte ein wenig Hilfe gebrauchen.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe01=Hört mich irgendjemand?
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackCastle00=Greift ihre Zitadelle an!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten dieses Söldnerlager einnehmen.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Greifen wir dieses Fort an!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackTower00=Lasst uns diesen Beobachtungspunkt einnehmen!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unsere Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verteidigt unser Fort!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir müssen unseren Beobachtungspunkt verteidigen.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_KillHero00=Wir müssen diesen Helden ausschalten.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed00=Wir sind vom Licht gesegnet.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed01=Das Licht scheint auf uns alle.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed02=Ich bin zu alt für derartigen Unfug.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed03=Manchmal ist das Licht am Ende des Tunnels ein Zug.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed04=Heute bin ich Uther der Schmerzbringer.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed05=Was zur ... Was ist mit der silbernen Hand im Himmel passiert?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed06=Im Ernst: Orden des Seltsamen Himmelsdreiecks klingt einfach nicht so gut.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed07=Zu meiner Zeit gab es nur eine Art von Paladin, und wir waren froh, dass es sie überhaupt gab.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed08=Die höchste Stufe für uns war Stufe 10. Und Ihr seid jetzt was, 100? Noch höher? <seufzt> Die Jugend von heute ...
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed09=<SFX: Niest> Gesegnet sei's.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed10=Könntet Ihr das noch einmal machen? Und ein klein wenig weiter links, vielleicht.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed11=Ah, ja, genau da.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed12=Mögen die Rechtschaffenen Frieden finden, und die Missetäter meine gepanzerte Faust.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed13=Es gab da mal eine Stadt, deren Bewohner doch tatsächlich von mir wissen wollten, wie man Licht in Eimern sammeln kann. Unerfahrene Stümper! Das Licht kann man nur bringen, nicht sammeln!
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed14=Übrigens hat mir ein kleiner Bronzedrache davon erzählt, was die Blutelfen mit meinem Grab vorhaben ... Ich bin nicht sonderlich erfreut.

VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt01=Feigheit ist keine Tugend.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt02=Habt Ihr kein Rückgrat?
VoiceOver/Uther/TeamKilled00=Ich werde zu alt für sowas.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_ExLocked00=Seid gegrüßt.

VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Collect01=Sollten wir die nicht einsammeln?
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Danger00=Vorsicht!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Danger01=Gebt Acht!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Defend00=Wir sollten unsere Verteidigung dorthin verlagern.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unsere Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verteidigt unser Fort!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendStructure00=Wir müssen dieses Gebäude sichern.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendStructure01=Wir MÜSSEN dieses Gebäude halten.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendThing00=Hier sollten wir verteidigen.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendThing01=Der Feind darf hier nicht siegreich sein.

VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_OnMyWay01=Ich bin gleich da.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Retreat00=Rückzug! Konzentrieren wir uns auf den nächsten Kampf!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Retreat01=Diesen Kampf müssen wir aufgeben.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Transport00=Bringt es weg von hier!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Transport01=Wir müssen es schnell wegschaffen.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_TurnIn00=Also los, geben wir sie ab.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_TurnIn01=Wir sollten sie abgeben, solange es uns möglich ist.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed00=Wir sind vom Licht gesegnet.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed01=Das Licht scheint auf uns alle.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed02=Ich bin zu alt für derartigen Unfug.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed03=Manchmal ist das Licht am Ende des Tunnels ein Zug.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed04=Heute bin ich Uther der Schmerzbringer.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed05=Was zur ... Was ist mit der silbernen Hand im Himmel passiert?
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed06=Im Ernst: Orden des Seltsamen Himmelsdreiecks klingt einfach nicht so gut.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed07=Zu meiner Zeit gab es nur eine Art von Paladin, und wir waren froh, dass es sie überhaupt gab.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed08=Die höchste Stufe für uns war Stufe 10. Und Ihr seid jetzt was, 100? Noch höher? <seufzt> Die Jugend von heute ...

VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeEnd00=Ein passendes Ende!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeEnd01=Der Gerechtigkeit entkommt Ihr nicht!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeEnd02=Dies ist das Ende aller Verräter des Lichts.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeStart00=Jetzt ist Euer Leben verwirkt.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeStart01=Gerechtigkeit verlangt nach Vergeltung.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeStart02=Ihr habt einen schrecklichen Fehler begangen.

VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Hmm, unser Feind ist verschwunden.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Ping_EnemyMissing01=Mein Gegner ist verschwunden.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Ping_KillHero00=Wir müssen diesen Helden ausschalten.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Ping_OnMyWay00=Ich komme.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Ping_OnMyWay01=Ich bin gleich da.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Ping_Retreat00=Rückzug! Konzentrieren wir uns auf den nächsten Kampf!
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Ping_Retreat01=Diesen Kampf müssen wir aufgeben.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Ping_Transport00=Bringt es weg von hier!

VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Ping_TurnIn00=Also los, geben wir sie ab.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Ping_TurnIn01=Wir sollten sie abgeben, solange es uns möglich ist.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed00=Wir sind vom Licht gesegnet.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed01=Das Licht scheint auf uns alle.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed02=Ich bin zu alt für derartigen Unfug.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed03=Manchmal ist das Licht am Ende des Tunnels ein Zug.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed04=Heute bin ich Uther der Schmerzbringer.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed05=Was zur ... Was ist mit der silbernen Hand im Himmel passiert?
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed06=Im Ernst: Orden des Seltsamen Himmelsdreiecks klingt einfach nicht so gut.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed07=Zu meiner Zeit gab es nur eine Art von Paladin, und wir waren froh, dass es sie überhaupt gab.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed08=Die höchste Stufe für uns war Stufe 10. Und Ihr seid jetzt was, 100? Noch höher? <seufzt> Die Jugend von heute ...
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed09=<SFX: Niest> Gesegnet sei's.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed10=Könntet Ihr das noch einmal machen? Und ein klein wenig weiter links, vielleicht.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed11=Ah, ja, genau da.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed12=Mögen die Rechtschaffenen Frieden finden, und die Missetäter meine gepanzerte Faust.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed13=Es gab da mal eine Stadt, deren Bewohner doch tatsächlich von mir wissen wollten, wie man Licht in Eimern sammeln kann. Unerfahrene Stümper! Das Licht kann man nur bringen, nicht sammeln!
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Pissed14=Übrigens hat mir ein kleiner Bronzedrache davon erzählt, was die Blutelfen mit meinem Grab vorhaben ... Ich bin nicht sonderlich erfreut.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Resurrected00=Ich freue mich, dass Ihr auf meiner Seite seid.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/Resurrected01=Danke, dass Ihr mich gerettet habt.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/RevengeEnd00=Ein passendes Ende!
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/RevengeEnd01=Der Gerechtigkeit entkommt Ihr nicht!
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/RevengeEnd02=Dies ist das Ende aller Verräter des Lichts.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/RevengeStart00=Jetzt ist Euer Leben verwirkt.
VoiceOver/UtherMedic/RevengeStart01=Gerechtigkeit verlangt nach Vergeltung.

VoiceOver/WitchDoctorMadAxe/MatchEnd01=Was soll ich noch mal sagen?
VoiceOver/WitchDoctorMadAxe/MatchEnd02=Was soll ich noch mal sagen?

VoiceOver/WizardA/MegaKill00=Megakill! Olé.
VoiceOver/WizardA/MegaKill01=Megakill!
VoiceOver/WizardA/MegaKill02=Megakill!
VoiceOver/WizardA/NineKill00=Unglaublich!
VoiceOver/WizardA/NineKill01=Einfach unglaublich!
VoiceOver/WizardA/SevenKill00=Monsterkill!
VoiceOver/WizardA/SevenKill01=Monsterkill! So geht das!
VoiceOver/WizardA/SixKill00=Ultrakill! Mann, war das gut.
VoiceOver/WizardA/SixKill01=Ultrakill!
VoiceOver/WizardA/TeamKill00=Gegnerisches Team dominiert. Perfekt!
VoiceOver/WizardA/TenKill00=Eine lebende Legende!
VoiceOver/WizardA/TripleKill00=Dreifachkill! Sauber!
VoiceOver/WizardA/TripleKill01=Dreifachkill!
VoiceOver/WizardA/TripleKill02=Dreifachkill!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Attack00=Lasst uns angreifen!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Attack01=Trödelt nicht. Greift Sie an!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Attack02=Entfesselt Eure Macht!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Caution00=Gebt Acht. Der Gegner plant etwas.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_GoodJob00=Wie beeindruckend!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_GoodJob01=Vielleicht bin ich hier doch nicht das einzige Wunderkind.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_GoodJob02=Ihr habt wahre Größe erlangt!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Heal00=Ihr könntet einen Ausflug zum Heilbrunnen gebrauchen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Heal01=Hier gibt es auch Heilbrunnen. Nutzt einen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Retreat00=Rückzug!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Retreat01=Zieht Euch zurück!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Uhoh00=Oh nein.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Uhoh01=Das lief jetzt aber nicht nach Plan.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/AI_Uhoh02=Einfach nur traurig.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack00=Wie fühlt sich das an?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack01=Euer Grab wartet!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack02=Ihr wagt es?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack03=Damit habt Ihr nicht gerechnet, oder?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack04=Ich glaube, das werdet Ihr bereuen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack05=Ihr seid es fast nicht wert.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack06=Ich weiß nicht, warum ich mir die Mühe mache.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Celebrate00=Ich wusste, wir schaffen das!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Celebrate01=Ja! Der Sieg ist nahe.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Comeback00=Seid stark, Freunde. Wir werden nicht versagen!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Healed00=Ich bin geheilt.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Healed01=Ich bin wieder gesund.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Healed02=Ich wurde geheilt.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree00=Das dürfte interessant werden.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree01=Betrachtet diese Schlacht als Demonstration.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree02=Wartet, bis Ihr seht, was ich alles drauf habe.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroBoast00=Das wird kein gutes Ende nehmen ... für alle, die sich gegen uns stellen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroBoast01=Ich habe zu lange studiert, um mich von fünf namenlosen Taugenichtsen besiegen zu lassen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion00=Seid Ihr bereit für den Sieg?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion01=Ich hoffe, Ihr seid auf diesen Kampf gut vorbereitet.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Seid Ihr gekommen, um eine weitere vernichtende Niederlage zu erleiden, Azmodan?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Da ist jemand, den ich niemals wiedersehen wollte.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Die Feinde vor uns könnten die stärksten sein, mit denen wir es je zu tun hatten.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Deckard00=Cain! Habe ich euch also wiedergefunden.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Wir stehen auf derselben Seite? Das ergibt keinen Sinn.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_LordofHell00=Wenn das hier vorbei ist, hab ich noch mehr als genug Energie übrig, um Euch ein Ende zu bereiten.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_MagicUser00=Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ich noch mal sehe, wie jemand diese alten Zauber benutzt!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=Der Engel des Todes ... hier?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Was seid Ihr für ein Monster? Habt ihr irgendwelche Affixe?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Ein Totenbeschwörer ... Kennt Ihr Mehtan?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Ich kämpfe an Eurer Seite? Das darf doch nicht wahr sein ...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Das wird ein Spaß. Das weiß ich jetzt schon!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_SpaceLordLeoric00=Eure bösen Mächte werden hier keinen Sieg erringen, Spacelord!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Ich bin sehr froh, dass Ihr an meiner Seite kämpft, Tyrael.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond00=Ohne Frage!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond01=Das dürfte kein Problem sein.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond02=Ich kann es kaum erwarten.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Wisst Ihr, wir könnten diese Schlacht vergessen und unseren eigenen Kampf schlagen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Kann ich nirgends hingehen, ohne dass Ihr mir ein Ohr abkaut?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Hm, ja, genau.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=<sarkastisch> Ihr wart schon immer höchst wortgewandt.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Also klüger sind sie bestimmt nicht geworden.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Irgendwie wusste ich, dass Ihr das sagen würdet.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=<seufzt> Muss das wirklich sein?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=Musstet Ihr diese Worte vorher nachschlagen?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Besser als um mein Bündnis mit Euch.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_LordofHell00=Um mich solltet Ihr Euch keine Sorgen machen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_MagicUser00=Schaut mir gut zu, vielleicht lernt Ihr noch was.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=Ich hoffe, jemand schneidet Euch die Flügel ab.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Wenn Ihr nichts Kluges sagen könnt, dann solltet Ihr am besten den Mund halten.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Ähm, ich bin eine Zauberin und mir scheint eher Euer Gleichgewicht etwas gestört.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Denkt nicht zu viel nach, Ihr könntet Euch dabei wehtun.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Es ist eine solche Erleichterung, wenn ich nicht alles selbst machen muss.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Oh, das kann ja was werden ...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_SpaceLordLeoric00=Im Namen der Sterne werde ich Euch bestrafen!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=So wie es sein sollte.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=Hm ... Vielleicht hätte ich doch noch etwas mehr studieren sollen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill00=Niemand kann mich aufhalten!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill01=Unglaublich, wie gut ich bin.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill02=Habt Ihr das gesehen?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill03=Eure Verteidigung ist nutzlos!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill04=Ich wärme mich gerade erst auf!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillAngel00=Unterschätzt niemals einen Nephalem.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillButcher00=Und wer ist jetzt das Frischfleisch?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDeckard00=Wo seid Ihr jetzt nur wieder reingeraten, Cain?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDemon00=Ihr lasst mich wohl niemals in Ruhe. Lernt Ihr denn gar nichts?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiablo00=DAS war für Leah.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiabloHero00=Hm, sollte ich mich an Euch erinnern?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillJaina00=Besser eine Zauberin als eine Magierin.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillKaelthas00=Ihr Elfenmagier könnt mit mir einfach nicht mithalten.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillLeoric00=Wie oft muss ich das denn noch tun?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMalthael00=Beim zweiten Mal sterbt Ihr wesentlich schneller.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMedivh00=Das Duell der Zaubermeister ist vorbei. Ihr habt verloren.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillNephalem00=Das war keine Absicht ... ich schwöre!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillSpreeEnd00=<lacht> Das war unterhaltsam.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillTyrael00=Das tut mir leid, mein Freund ...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillWeird00=Jetzt seid Ihr tot. Es ist mir ein Rätsel, wie Ihr überhaupt leben konntet. Bwah.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh00=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh01=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh02=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh03=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh04=<larger laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ich danke Euch für Eure Hilfe, Heiler.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ich habe wohl einen neuen Schutzengel.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ihr kommt genau zur rechten Zeit!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana00=Mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana01=Ich habe nicht genügend Mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana02=Ich brauche mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No00=Warum sollte ich das tun?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No01=Ausgeschlossen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No02=Das werde ich nicht tun.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Dieser Krieger könnte unsere Hilfe gebrauchen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Ein wenig Hilfe, bitte?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Ich ... brauche Hilfe.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Es ist an der Zeit, ihre Zitadelle einzureißen!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Ich möchte dieses Söldnerlager einnehmen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Greifen wir dieses Fort an!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt einnehmen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Unsere Zitadelle darf nicht fallen! Dann verlieren wir!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Dieses Fort braucht Hilfe. Sofort!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt beschützen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_KillHero00=Wir müssen diesen Helden töten.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed00=Ich werde meine Bestimmung erfüllen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed01=Hmm... Die Zauberei fiel mir schon immer leicht.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed02=Ja, ich bin die Zauberin, die das Sanktum der Yshari zerstört hat. Aber ich hatte keine Wahl.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed03=Niveau sieht nur von unten aus wie Arroganz.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed04=<ironisch> Aber ja, ich habe die uralten Geheimnisse der Magie ergründet, nur damit Ihr mich hier belästigen könnt. Woher wusstet Ihr das?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed05=Obwohl ... <drohend>das wäre doch mal eine gute Gelegenheit, meinen Stillezauber auszuprobieren.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed06=Schauen wir mal, wie Euch DAS gefällt! <SFX: Magic casting sound>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed07=(geknebeltes Gemurmel - hat den Stillezauber auf sich selbst gewirkt)
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed08=<SFX: Magic casting sound> *räusper* Ein ... Ein derartiger Fehler ist mir noch nie unterlaufen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed09=Solltet Ihr JEMALS irgendwem davon erzählen, schieße ich Euch auf eine andere Existenzebene. Verstanden?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed10=Meine Lehrer haben mir immer gesagt, ich sei zu eingebildet. Dabei war Einbildung doch die einzige Bildung, die ich von ihnen erhalten habe. Pah!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed11=Ist es nicht komisch, dass Eirena zum Wirken ihrer Zauber einen "Fokus" verwendet und trotzdem immer so ... so ... na ja, sagen wir mal, leicht abgelenkt ist?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed12=Einmal habe ich ein Magisches Geschoss in die Dunkelheit abgefeuert. Oh Mann ... Die hat sich vielleicht aufgeregt.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed13=Könnte mir mal bitte jemand das Wasser reichen?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed14=Isendra war eine großartige Lehrerin. Doch sie hat oft ein paar Geheimnisse für sich behalten. Ich weiß immer noch nicht, wie sie sich so schnell teleportieren konnte ... und so ganz ohne Abklingzeit.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed15=Und für meinen nächsten Trick werde ich dieses Monster <Monster-Grunzen> in einen legendären Gegenstand verwandeln. <brutzel><Monster platzt> *enttäuscht* Och Mann! Schon wieder Blackthorne. <D3-Wegwerfgeräusch>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected00=Ihr seid mein neuer Lieblingsheiler!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected01=Ihr seid besser als die Priester der Zakarum!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive00=Sieht so aus, als ist heute nicht der Tag, an dem ich sterbe.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive01=Oh, das lief aber nicht wie geplant ...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive02=Ich sollte mehr Vorsicht walten lassen ... oder weniger.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec00=Meine Macht wächst.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec01=Gut gemacht.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec02=Wenn mich meine alten Meister jetzt sehen könnten ...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec03=Ich bin jetzt noch besser!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec04=Ich werde noch mächtiger.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt00=Ich hoffe, Ihr habt mit allem abgeschlossen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt01=Seid Ihr bereit zu sterben?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt02=Ein würdiger Feind!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/TeamKilled00=Ein schwieriges Unterfangen, aber wir dürfen die Hoffnung nicht aufgeben.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_ExLocked00=Benötigt Ihr die Hilfe einer Zauberin?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ich bin gekommen, um zu helfen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Gift00=Ich gehe dort hin, wo die Not am größten ist.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Lockin00=Dieses Reich braucht mich.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Purchase00=Ich wusste, wir werden Freunde.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial00=Ihr möchtet, dass ich angebe? <lacht>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial01=Mit Magie spielt man nicht. Aber ich mache mal eine Ausnahme ...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Auf los geht's los.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Ich mache nicht nur Probleme. Ich kann sie auch lösen.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ich warte ...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Werde ich heute endlich weiterziehen können?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used00=Ich bin eine Nummer zu groß für Euch!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used01=Das ist Euer Ende!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used02=Arkane Macht gefällig?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used03=<laughs>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate2Used00=Schert Euch fort!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate2Used01=Jetzt reicht's!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Cheer00=<Cheering exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Cheer01=<Cheering exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled00=<Pulled Exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled01=<Pulled Exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled02=<Pulled Exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled03=<Pulled Exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Pulled04=<Pulled Exertion>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineFive00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineFour00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineOne00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineThree00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineTwo00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/WorthIt00=Ha! Hab ich Euch. Alles andere ist mir egal.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/WorthIt01=Das hätte auch schlimmer enden können.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes00=Hmpf, na gut.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes01=Dann mal los.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes02=Und los geht's.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes03=Wohin?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes04=Es scheint, als nehmen meine Reisen kein Ende.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes05=Sollte ich überhaupt hier sein?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes06=Manchmal vermisse ich Caldeum ziemlich.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes07=Wenn es leicht wäre, würden es alle tun.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes08=Meine Zauber sind bereit.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes09=Warum nicht?
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack00=Greift an! Der Feind ist schwach!
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack01=Der Feind zeigt seine Schwäche. Schlagt sofort zu!
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack02=Ich kann es spüren. Jetzt ist die Zeit zum Zuschlagen!
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Caution00=Achtung. Der Feind plant etwas.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob00=Ein würdiger Tod.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob01=Niemand wird uns aufhalten.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob02=Gut gemacht.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Heal00=Heile dich. Sofort.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Heal01=Geh zu einem Heilbrunnen, solange du noch kannst.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Retreat00=Ich muss mich zurückziehen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Retreat01=Ich ziehe mich vorerst zurück.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh00=Eine erbärmliche Leistung.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh01=<Sharp angry growl.>
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh02=Eine unglückliche Wendung.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack00=Wir verschlingen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack01=Die Beute nähert sich.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack02=Spürt den Zorn des Schwarms!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack03=Ich bin dein Untergang!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack04=<angry growl>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack05=Der Schwarm wird dich zerquetschen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack06=Jetzt wirst du bezahlen!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Celebrate00=Für den Schwarm!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Celebrate01=Wir triumphieren!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Comeback00=Wir holen auf den Feind auf! Lasst nicht nach.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death00=<Todesröcheln>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death01=<Todesröcheln>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death02=<Todesröcheln>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death03=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death04=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death05=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death06=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death07=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed00=Gut gemacht, mein Diener.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed01=Meine Wunden schließen sich.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed02=Ich heile.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree00=<kichert> Gut.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree01=Alle, die sich uns in den Weg stellen, werden vernichtet.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree02=Der Schwarm wird alles erobern.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroBoast00=Reißen wir ihnen die Gliedmaßen einzeln aus!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroBoast01=Zeigt unseren Feinden den Zorn des Schwarms!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion00=Bereit, meine Diener?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion01=Wollen wir sie in Stücke reißen?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Abathur00=Versage nicht, Evolutionsmeister.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Anubarak00=Hm, mit dir wäre der Schwarm noch mächtiger.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=Meine Königin ...
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Du bist eine seltsame Kreatur.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Ach ... du.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Endlich ein brauchbarer Verbündeter.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Sonya00=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroQuestion00>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Sonya01=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroQuestion00>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_SonyaDK00=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroQuestion00>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_SonyaDK01=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroQuestion01>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond00=Der Schwarm ist bereit.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond01=Die Frage eines Narren.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond02=Wir entwickeln uns und wir erobern.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Abathur00=Unsere Zeit ist gekommen, Abathur! Für den Schwarm!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Anubarak00=Widerling.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Zweifellos.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Murky00=Wie hast du mich gerade genannt?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Negative00=Schweig. Wir haben einen Kampf zu gewinnen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Positive00=Lasst uns diesen Narren den Zorn des Schwarms zeigen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Sonya00=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroRespond00>
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Sonya01=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroRespond01>

VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_SonyaDK02=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroRespond02>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill00=Unterwerft euch dem Schwarm!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill01=Klägliche Kreatur.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill02=Weich und schwach.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill03=Du hattest nie eine Chance.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill04=Ich triumphiere.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillAbathur00=Du gehörst in die Evolutionsgrube, nicht auf das Schlachtfeld.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillDemon00=Solch eine mächtige Essenz. Abathur sollte sich das einmal ansehen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillKerrigan00=Jetzt bin ich das Herz des Schwarms!
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillProtoss00=Ich liebe das Geräusch brechender Protoss-Knochen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillSpreeEnd00=Deine Zeit ist abgelaufen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillTerran00=Nutzloser Terraner.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillZagara00=Ich bin die Oberste der Brutmütter!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Laugh01=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal00=Mir geht es besser? Gut gemacht.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal01=Du hast mich gerettet ...
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal02=Gerade rechtzeitig, mein Diener.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana00=Mir fehlt Mana.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana01=Mir geht das Mana aus.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana02=Ich brauche mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd01=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd02=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Zagara/No00=Ich kann diesen Befehl nicht ausführen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/No01=Unmöglich.
VoiceOver/Zagara/No02=Nein, das kann ich nicht.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistHero00=Helft unserem Verbündeten!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistMe00=Meine Brut wird angegriffen!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistMe01=Der Feind hat mich im Visier!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackCastle00=Lasst uns die Zitadelle des Gegners stürmen!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackMerc00=Ich empfehle, dieses Söldnerlager einzunehmen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Lasst uns dieses Fort vernichten!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt sichern.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendCastle00=Verteidigt unsere Zitadelle.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Wir sollten dieses Fort verteidigen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt schützen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_KillHero00=Dieser Held muss sterben.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed00=Meine Brut ist bereit.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed01=Der Schwarm ist hungrig.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed02=Sollten wir nicht mehr Overlords erschaffen?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed03=Ich bin die Königin des Todes.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed04=Mein Hintern ist so riesig, mein Hintern dient dem Schwarm, im Sommer gibt er Schatten, im Winter hält er warm.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed05=Es ist KEIN Tumor! Ah, Moment, es ist ja doch einer, ein Kriechertumor. Vergiss es.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed06=Gott schütze die Königin! Alle anderen können ruhig sterben ...
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed07=Es ist gar nicht so leicht, als alleinerziehende Brutmutter 4,5 Millionen Zerg großzuziehen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed08=Immer nur die Brutjungfer, niemals die Braut!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed09=Wenn ich erst einmal die Königin der Klingen bin, muss ich mir das von dir nicht mehr gefallen lassen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed10=Ich bin erst vier Jahre alt und schon eine Brutmutter. Hoffentlich bekommt mein Brutvater davon keinen Wind.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed11=<seltsame Zerg-Geräusche> <räuspert sich> Tut mir leid, da bin ich wohl in meinen Akzent verfallen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed12=Was soll das? Dreh dich um! Es ist unhöflich, einer Königin bei der Larveninjektion zuzusehen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed13=Manchmal wird mein Kopf so ... schwer.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed14=Gib mir nur ein wenig Zeit und ich bahne mir den Weg in dein erbärmliches Terraner-Herz.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Resurrected00=Vereint sind wir unsterblich.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Resurrected01=Neubildung abgeschlossen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Revive00=Der Schwarm lebt ewig.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Revive01=Dachtest du, du wärst mich los?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Revive02=Ich kehre immer und immer wieder.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec00=Mutation abgeschlossen
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec01=Ja, das wird seinen Zweck erfüllen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec02=Ich fühle mich bereits stärker.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec03=Perfekt.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec04=Jetzt kann mich nichts mehr aufhalten.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Taunt00=Ich bin Zagara. Erzittere vor mir!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Taunt01=Für dich besteht keine Hoffnung.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Taunt02=Nur der Tod erwartet dich!
VoiceOver/Zagara/TeamKilled00=Dafür werden sie mit ihrem Leben bezahlen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_ExLocked00=Sprich, Terraner.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_ExPurchased00=Wie kann ich dir dienen?
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Gift00=Sollen wir eine andere Welt erobern?
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Lockin00=Nichts hält den Schwarm auf.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Purchase00=Der Schwarm hört deinen Befehl.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Trial00=Meine Brut besteht jede Prüfung.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Trial01=Lass mich dir die Pracht des Schwarms zeigen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitLocked00=Du stellst meine Geduld auf die Probe.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitLocked01=Wir sollten diese Zeit besser auf dem Schlachtfeld verbringen.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ich erkenne kein Ziel hinter deiner Untätigkeit. Dir fehlt Weitsicht.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitPurchased01=Meine Klauen sehnen sich danach, die Knochen unserer Gegner zu zersplittern. Legen wir los?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used00=Der Boden wird beben!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used01=Zeige dich, Nydus!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used02=Erzittert vor dem Nyduswurm!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used03=Der Schwarm erhebt sich!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate2Used00=Der Schwarm verschlingt alles.

VoiceOver/Zeratul/AI_Attack00=Greift sofort an! Der Feind ist schwach!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/AI_Attack01=Schlagt zu, Freunde! Solange wir noch Zeit dazu haben!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/AI_Attack02=Stürzt Euch auf sie! Zeigt keine Schwäche!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/AI_Caution00=Vorsicht ist ratsam.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/AI_GoodJob00=Ein ausgezeichneter Schlag.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/AI_GoodJob01=Gut gemacht.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/AI_GoodJob02=Niemand stellt sich uns entgegen.

VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Artanis00=Ohne Frage. Meine Klinge gehört Euch, Hierarch.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Nein, nicht so wie Ihr.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Indeed00=In der Tat.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Unsere Definitionen von "amüsieren" unterscheiden sich sehr.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Murky00=Lasst Euch nicht von der Rache überwältigen, kleines Wesen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Negative00=Lasst Eure Taten für Euch sprechen.

VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Raynor00=In der Tat ... sogar etwas zu sehr.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Tassadar00=Und wir werden uns ihr stellen, alter Freund.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Kill00=Ich übergebe Euch der Leere.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Kill01=Euer Schicksal endet hier.

VoiceOver/Zeratul/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowLifeHeal00=Ihr habt mich dem Abgrund entrissen. Ich stehe in Eurer Schuld.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowLifeHeal01=Das Leben durchfließt mich erneut.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowLifeHeal02=Meine Zeit ist noch nicht gekommen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowMana00=Mein Mana geht zur Neige.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowMana01=Mein Mana schwindet.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowMana02=Ich benötige mehr Mana.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/No00=Das ist unmöglich.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/No01=Das kann ich nicht tun.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/No02=Nein.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AssistHero00=Ein Verbündeter benötigt unsere Hilfe.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AssistMe00=Ich halte nicht stand!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AssistMe01=Ich schwebe in Gefahr!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AttackCastle00=Zerstört die feindliche Zitadelle!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AttackMerc00=Wir sollten dieses Söldnerlager einnehmen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Attackieren wir das Fort des Gegners!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AttackTower00=Dieser Beobachtungspunkt wartet nur auf uns.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_DefendCastle00=Wir müssen unsere Zitadelle verteidigen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Verteidigt unser Fort!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_DefendTower00=Wir sollten diesen Beobachtungspunkt beschützen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_KillHero00=Das Schicksal verlangt den Tod dieses Helden.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed00=Sprecht Ihr mich an?
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed01=Ich werde die Dämonen der Vergangenheit auslöschen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed02=Sensen sind nicht zu verachten, aber ich ziehe Mantel und Degen vor ... nur dass mein Degen etwas kürzer und leuchtender ist und nicht in der Hand gehalten wird. ... Hm, vielleicht denke ich da noch einmal drüber nach.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed03=Ihr wärt überrascht, wie leicht es ist, sich auf ein Raumschiff zu schleichen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed04=Dunkle Templer explodieren nicht, wenn das Sonnenlicht sie trifft, ganz egal, WIE dunkel sie sind ...
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed05=<Niest> Was zum ... Was war das? Wie habe ich das denn gemacht?
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed06=Sprecht langsam und schwingt eine große Warpklinge.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed07=Ich sollte meine Fähigkeiten nutzen, um gegnerische Helden anzugreifen. Außerdem sollte ich herausfinden, warum ich mir immer selbst Ratschläge erteile.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed08=Ich bringe düstere Kunde ... ach, nicht wirklich, ich sage das nur gern.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed09=Die Dunkelheit und ich gehen Hand in Hand. Einzig die Leere wird leicht eifersüchtig.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed10=Die Prophezeiung spricht von einem Auserwählten, der der Macht das Gleichgewi... äh, Halt, Stopp. DAS ist die falsche Prophezeiung ... Uff, um ein Haar hätten wir uns eine Klage eingehandelt.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed11=Die menschliche Anatomie verblüfft mich ... Wie soll man denn mit nur einem gegenüberliegenden Greifglied seinen ... nun ja, seinen Phylar halten? ... Oh ... Ich wollte Euch nicht beleidigen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed12=Die Schatten umgeben mich. <Pause> Das wird langsam echt lästig ... Weiß jemand, wie man die wieder los wird?
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed13=Dunkel war's, der Mond schien helle, staubbedeckt Shakuras' Flur, als ein Templer blitzeschnelle langsam in die Schatten fuhr.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed14=Vor langer Zeit prophezeite ein Orakel meines Volkes, dass ein Held kommen und meine Klinge zum Sieg führen würde. Offensichtlich seid Ihr dieser Held ... nicht.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Resurrected00=Habt Dank!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Resurrected01=Meine Zeit ist noch nicht gekommen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Revive00=Ich werde tun, was getan werden muss.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Revive01=Ich kehre aus der Leere zurück.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Revive02=Ich werde nicht weichen. Ich werde nicht wanken.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Spec00=Es wird geschehen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Spec01=Clever.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Spec02=Das wird mir helfen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Spec03=Äußerst hilfreich.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Spec04=Die Schatten gewinnen an Stärke.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Taunt00=Ihr könnt nicht bekämpfen, was Ihr nicht seht.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Taunt01=Die Dunklen Templer erheben sich gegen Euch!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Taunt02=Ich bin der Wille der Xel'Naga.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/TeamKilled00=Wir müssen zum Gegenangriff übergehen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_ExLocked00=Die Leere ruft mich.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_ExPurchased00=En taro Adun.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_Gift00=Ein neuer Verbündeter erwartet mich.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_Lockin00=So diene ich.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_Purchase00=Wir werden das Schicksal wenden.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_Trial00=Ich kann Euch die Geheimnisse der Leere zeigen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_Trial01=Möge die Prüfung beginnen.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_WaitLocked00=Die Geheimnisse der Xel'Naga lüften sich nicht von selbst.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_WaitLocked01=Ich werde Eure Klinge aus den Schatten sein.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_WaitPurchased00=Wisst Ihr nicht, wie alt ich bin? Und Ihr lasst mich hier warten ...
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_WaitPurchased01=Dunkle Templer sind Nomaden ... Wir verweilen nicht gerne am selben Ort ... ohne Aufgabe. <hust>
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ultimate1Used00=Euer Schicksal ist besiegelt.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ultimate1Used01=Die Leere wird Euch aufnehmen.
