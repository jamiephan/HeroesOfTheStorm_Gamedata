Conversation/CreepVO/Line00104=Думаю, с них хватит! Ха-ха!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00105=Что, все заплатили? А, без разницы! Свистать всех наверх, ха-ха!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00106=Ну что, по рукам! Сейчас зададим врагам жару!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00107=Похоже, враги вас обставили! Впредь будете умнее!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00108=Враги утерли вам нос! Ха-ха-ха!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00109=У ваших врагов тугие карманы! Выкатывайте орудия!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00110=Гоните дублоны, и, может быть, я постреляю в ваших врагов!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00111=Итак, кто же соберет достаточно даров на этот раз?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00112=Поднесите мне дар или будете прокляты. Все просто.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00113=Я устал от вашей возни. Лучше преподнесите мне дар! Получите мою милость!

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00116=(Смеется) Эти сухопутные крысы меня озолотят! Продолжаем стрельбу!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00117=Похоже, ваши враги заплатили больше! Хе-хе-хе!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00118=Для ваших врагов задул попутный ветер!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00119=Кто платит, тому и помогаю. А у ваших врагов денег куры не клюют!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00120=Не ваш день, да? Не повезло! Пли!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00121=Еще разок!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00122=Хотите добавки? Ха-ха!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00123=Арр! Теперь для вас задул попутный ветер!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00124=Так-так-так... мои пушки теперь ваши!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00125=Палите по их врагам! Надо отработать денежки!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00183=Пора устроить заварушку! Дублоны получит тот, кто откроет сундук.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00184=Знаете что? Сокровища каждому! Но в основном — мне! <Смех>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00185=Думаете, вы можете открыть оба сундука, сосунки?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00186=Какой пират не мечтает о золотишке? <Смех>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00187=К черту охоту за сокровищами, они уже здесь! Хватайте быстрее.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00188=Посмотрим, как вам два сундука за раз, ха-ха!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00189=Надеюсь, вы не прочь поискать сокровища.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00190=Десяток храбрецов на сундук мертвеца. Йо-хо-хо! Эй! Кто украл мою бутылку?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00198=Теперь вы ощутите мой гнев.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00200=А теперь вы погибнете.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00202=Хватит, чтобы заплатить мне... на какое-то время! Пушки к бою!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00207=Ха-а! По рукам. Сейчас пошлем им орудийный привет!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00234=Говорят, в доках есть сокровища... Живее за ними!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00235=Все, хватит! Мы бесплатно не воюем!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00236=Ладно, и кто оплатит мои услуги? <Мрачный смешок>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00237=Ар-р! Ар-р! Что такое? Звучит здорово.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00238=Стреляйте или вместо ядер полетят ваши головы!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00239=А вот и солидная кучка золота!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00242=Кому же достанутся сокровища? <смеется>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00247=Так, что тут у нас? Опять балбесы пришли в гости к Черносерду?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00248=Эй, трюмные крысы! Здесь все уважают капитана. А лучший знак уважения — монеты! Ха-ха!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00249=Плевать, как вы их достанете.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00250=Воровство...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00251=Убийство... и ладно!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00252=Найдите мой корабль и заплатите побольше! Тогда и я отплачу врагам — залпами пушек! Ха-ха-ха!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00254=Знайте, что этот мир под моей защитой. Я здесь хозяин!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00255=Если вам нужна победа, соберите для меня дары.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00256=Успеете первыми — получите благословение.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00257=Враги падут: силы покинут их, а защита ослабнет.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00258=Лучше воспользуйтесь моментом. Моя милость не вечна. Ха-ха.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00259=Ну что? Готовы начать?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00260=Вы явились в Проклятую лощину? Занятно.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00261=Путь в шахту скоро будет открыт... еще немного, и мертвые пробудятся.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00262=В глубинах шахты таится смерть... Вы отважитесь ступить во тьму?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00263=Готовы сразиться с нежитью? Вскоре вы сможете спуститься в шахту.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00264=Герои, мертвецы вновь восстали из могил. Осмелитесь ли вы войти в шахту?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00265=Пути назад нет...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00266=Входите, герои, проклятые мертвецы ждут.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00267=Слышите, как щелкают челюсти? (Мрачно) Мертвые проголодались.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00268=Восстаньте, големы! Восстаньте и дайте волю гневу!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00269=Восстаньте, големы!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00270=Пора моим големам пробудиться вновь.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00271=Отлично, ваш голем сильнее вражеского.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00272=Голем готов... Но он слабее, чем голем врага.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00273=Похоже, оба голема равны по силе.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00274=Големы вернулись... и ваш гораздо сильнее.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00275=Отлично! Ваш голем гораздо сильнее, чем у противника.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00276=Големы пробудились... Но знайте, что ваш намного слабее вражеского.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00277=Нужно собрать больше черепов, если хотите получить голема посильнее.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00278=Големы восстали из мертвых, и их силы почти равны.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00279=Хм-м. Похоже, силы обоих големов почти равны.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00280=Мои големы вернулись... Будет весело.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00281=Дайте волю неистовой ярости!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00282=Держитесь! Ужас поднимается из могил.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00283=<Dark laughter>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00284=Отлично, главное развлечение вот-вот начнется.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00285=Похоже, наступает мертвый сезон.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00286=Приветствую, глупцы. Это — Призрачные копи. Вечное царство смерти.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00287=Вскоре вход откроется... и в шахте пробудится ужас.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00288=<Смех> Мы можем заключить взаимовыгодную сделку.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00289=Вы должны убить нежить. И собрать все черепа.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00290=В обмен на них я смогу призвать мощных големов.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00291=Они сокрушат укрепления врага. Ну что, договорились?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00292=Древние святилища вновь открыты! Обретите власть над ними и освободите рыцаря-дракона!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00293=Святилища накапливают энергию. Заключенный в камень рыцарь-дракон взывает к вам.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00294=Святилища вскоре вновь откроются...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00295=Святилища набирают силу. Пусть гнев дракона вырвется наружу!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00296=Скорее, захватите святилища и обретите силу дракона!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00297=Дракон пробудился... время обрести его силу!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00298=Захватите святилища, чтобы обрести силу дракона.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00299=Освободите рыцаря-дракона, истребите врагов!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00300=Пришло время освободить рыцаря-дракона!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00301=Используйте силу дракона, герои!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00302=Cокрушите врагов!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00303=Герои, противник контролирует святилища...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00304=Сейчас вы познаете гнев дракона.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00305=Времени все меньше, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00306=Враги сгорят дотла!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00307=Враги обратятся в пепел!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00308=Я снова жив!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00309=Вы сгорите дотла.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00310=Огонь очистит все.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00311=Вы обратитесь в пепел.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00312=Я не вернусь в эту темницу! Нет!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00313=Нет, я не закончил!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00314=Драконы вновь обретут власть!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00315=Драконы завоюют этот мир!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00316=Это Cады Драконьего края... Они прекрасны, правда? И все это — ложь, видимость...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00317=Все забыли правду, забыли о моем роде. О драконах, которые правили миром.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00318=Захватите святилища Солнца и Луны, и магические путы рыцаря-дракона ослабнут.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00319=Вы обретете силу дракона. Сожгите врагов! Разрушьте их укрепления! Пусть этот мир вспомнит о своей подлинной истории.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00320=Дракон будет возрожден, герои. Вы можете обуздать его мощь... или он вас сокрушит. Выбор за вами.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00321=Ваш голем слабее, чем у противника. Готовьтесь защищаться.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00322=Големы равны по силе. Готовьтесь к бою.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00323=Призыв завершен. Ваш голем сильнее, чем голем врага.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00324=Ваш голем сильнее, чем у противника. Используйте ситуацию с умом.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00325=Голем слаб. Нужно больше черепов.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00326=Готово. Ваш голем равен по силе голему противника.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00327=Обретите свободу и уничтожьте врагов!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00328=Убивайте нежить, чтобы получить их черепа, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00329=Собирайте черепа, чтобы усилить голема!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00330=Проклятые мертвецы скоро вернутся. Будьте начеку, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00331=Внемлите, герои: мертвые вскоре восстанут во глубине шахты.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00332=Восстаньте, мои големы, и дайте волю безграничной ярости!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00333=Святилища вновь открыты. Кому же удастся получить силу рыцаря-дракона?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00334=Дракон ждет, герои! Освободите его, и он уничтожит врага.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00335=Время пришло! Обуздайте силу дракона!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00336=Конец близок: дракон возродится и придет на помощь врагу!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00337=Ваши враги падут!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00338=Вас поглотит пламя!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00339=Время... уходит.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00340=Герои, вскоре настанет ночь!.. Надеюсь, вы готовы.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00341=Спускается ночь, герои. Мой сад так прекрасен под светом луны.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00342=Снова опускается ночь, и скоро шаркуны явятся вновь.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00343=Спускается ночь, герои. Убейте шаркунов и заберите семена.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00344=Ночь наступит через 30 секунд. Надеюсь, вы готовы поразвлечься?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00345=Шаркуны просыпаются! Убейте их... Заберите их семена.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00346=Шаркуны просыпаются... Очистите их от несовершенной плоти.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00347=Час настал... За дело, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00348=Шаркуны просыпаются. Верните мои семена, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00349=Убейте их всех. Верните мои семена!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00350=Уже светает... поторопитесь.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00351=Светает... Наше время на исходе.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00352=Светает. Наступает новый день.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00353=<озлобленно> Проклятое солнце... Верните мои семена...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00358=Вы собрали достаточно семян. Несите их сюда... и я улучшу вашу слабую плоть...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00359=Наконец-то вы собрали достаточно семян. Идите... станьте гордостью моего сада.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00360=Посадите семена... и упивайтесь страхом ваших врагов.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00361=Сажайте семена, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00362=Высаживайте семена.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00363=Не испытывайте мое терпение. Сажайте семена.... и я дам вам силу.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00364=Моя почва ждет семян.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00365=Сажайте семена, мясные создания!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00366=Ваш ужас ожил! Вперед! Пожинайте тела врагов!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00367=Отлично! Вперед. Снесите вражеские форты!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00368=Восстань, мой ужас! Вытяни жизнь из своих врагов!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00369=Герои, враги порождают ужас.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00370=Вражеский ужас расцветает.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00371=Ваши враги посеяли ужас.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00372=Ваш ужас ожил.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00373=Наконец-то ваш ужас ожил.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00374=Ваш ужас расцветает. Молитесь, чтобы он был сильнее вражеского порождения.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00375=Ваши враги породили ужас.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00376=Ваши враги породили свой собственный ужас!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00377=Герои, ваши враги породили ужас!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00378=О, нет! Мой прекрасный ужас погиб.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00379=Ваш ужас пал. Вы снова состоите из плоти и костей.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00380=Твой ужас, мое дитя, увял.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00381=Вражеский ужас превратился в прах.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00382=Вражеский ужас пал.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00383=Вражеский ужас высох изнутри.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00384=Ваш ужас пал, а вражеское порождение продолжает жить.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00385=Вражеский ужас жив.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00386=Теперь вы сами по себе.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00387=Вас никто не остановит. Уничтожьте их!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00388=О, да... направляйте мой ужас. Не оставляйте никого в живых.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00389=Вражеский ужас пал. В атаку, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00394=Вы собрали достаточно семян! Посадите их, чтобы они проросли и улучшили слабую плоть...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00395=Наконец-то вы собрали достаточно семян. Посадите их здесь и станьте гордостью моего сада.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00396=Чудесно, герои. Несите сюда семена и упивайтесь страхом ваших врагов.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00397=Ужас расцвел!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00398=Ужас ожил.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00399=Ужас расцвел!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00400=Ужас ожил.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00401=<зевает> Восходит солнце... Моим детям нужно на время уснуть.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00402=Вижу, вы пережили еще одну ночь. Какая удивительная удача!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00403=<зевает> Настал рассвет, герои. Это значит, что моим детям пора отдыхать.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00404=Пока все стихло... но не стоит расслабляться, зараженные вернутся вновь.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00405=О, герои <смеется>, вы как раз вовремя — мои сады оживают.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00406=Ночью мы преображаемся... и Сад ужасов расцветает.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00407=Уничтожьте этих шаркунов. Заберите их семена.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00408=Соберете достаточно, и я наделю вас силой природы.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00411=Высаживайте семена и несите смерть врагам.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00412=Теперь нужно посадить семена.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00413=И чего вы ждете? У вас есть семена — сажайте их.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00414=Сажайте семена в землю. Торопитесь!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00415=Сажайте семена... Вы сможете перевоплотиться даже при дневном свете.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00416=Смотрите, ваш ужас ожил! Пусть он пожнет трупы врагов.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00417=Прекрасно! Ужас снесет вражеские форты!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00418=Отлично. Сейчас ужас вытянет жизнь из ваших врагов.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00419=Ваши враги породили ужас. Занятно.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00420=Сожалею, но ваши враги породили ужас!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00421=Ваши враги вырастили ужас.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00422=Ваш ужас ожил. Разве он не прекрасен?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00423=Думаю, ужас сейчас как раз будет кстати.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00424=Вы породили ужас. Интересно, он сильнее вражеского творения?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00425=Герои, ваши враги тоже породили ужас!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00426=О, похоже, ваши враги породили свой собственный ужас!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00427=Герои, ваши враги породили ужас!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00428=Ваш ужас увял.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00429=Ваш ужас превратился в прах.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00430=Ваш ужас срезан под корень.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00431=Хорошо! Вражеский ужас увял.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00432=Вы уничтожили вражеский ужас.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00433=Прекрасно, ужас ваших врагов высох изнутри.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00434=Ваш ужас пал, а вражеское порождение живо, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00435=Вражеский ужас все еще жив, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00436=Надеюсь, вы сможете остановить врагов без моего ужаса...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00437=Вражеский ужас пал! Тесните их, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00438=Вы уничтожили их ужас! Вы завоевываете мое расположение, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00439=Их ужас срезан под корень! Собирайте урожай, герои!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00440=Какая чудесная ночь... для проклятия.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00442=Распространяйте заразу. Такова воля королевы спор...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00443=Наконец-то вы собрали достаточно семян. Ужас снова растет!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00444=Вы собрали достаточно семян. Ваш ужас прекрасно растет.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00445=Прекрасно, герои. Скоро Ужас Садов будет повиноваться вам.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00446=Этих семян должно хватить. Пусть растет ужас!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00447=Ужас ждет вас, герои. Придите и воспользуйтесь его силой.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00448=Что вас удерживает? Ужасы не вечны.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00449=Ваш ужас увядает. Я бы на вашем месте поспешила.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00450=Почему вы мешкаете? Пробудите мой ужас!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00452=Слишком поздно, герои. Вы отвергли мой дар... теперь страдайте без него.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00453=Вы позволите моему ужасу увянуть на корню? Как глупо.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00454=Ваш ужас увял... Как расточительно.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00455=Какая жалость, ваш ужас увял. Он был таким цветущим...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00457=Пожните плоды своих трудов, герои. Заставьте мой ужас ожить.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00459=Используйте ваш ужас! Поверьте, вам понравится.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00460=У вас достаточно семян. Ужас растет!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00461=Наконец-то вы собрали достаточно семян. Чувствуете, как ужас набирает силу?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00462=Да, этого достаточно. Скоро Ужас Садов будет вашим.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00463=Этих семян будет достаточно. Теперь мой ужас пустит ростки!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00464=Ужас ждет вас. Придите и воспользуйтесь его силой.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00465=Торопитесь. Ужас ждет ваших приказаний.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00468=Ваш ужас вянет. Неужели все усилия были впустую?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00469=Ужас не будет ждать долго... Воспользуйтесь его мощью!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00470=Пришла пора пожинать урожай. Оживите мой ужас.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00472=Используйте ваш ужас! Убейте всех врагов!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00473=Вы отвергли мой дар? Тогда страдайте без него.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00474=Мой ужас увядает? Глупцы!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00475=Ваш ужас увял... Какая расточительность.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00476=Как вы осмелились дать моему ужасу зачахнуть...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00477=Мои големы пали. Но не беда, черепов всегда в достатке.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00478=Големы были побеждены.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00479=Мои големы вновь преданы земле. Ненадолго.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00480=Големы еще вернутся, герои.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00481=Итак, големы пали. Прах к праху, как говорится.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00482=Проклятие исчезло. Пока кто-нибудь снова не заслужит мое расположение.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00483=И вот проклятие исчезло. Надеюсь, вы оценили его по достоинству.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00484=Отлично. Ваши враги ослабли. Пусть они падут перед вами.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00485=На вас ложится проклятие, герои. Удастся ли вам выжить? <смех>

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00004=Приветствую тебя, герой... Меня зовут Утер Светоносный, а ты — избранник Нексуса.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00005=Нексус? <обдумывает> Стало быть, тут замешаны протоссы?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00006=Что? Какие... Послушай...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00007=Нексус — это космическая буря на стыке миров, времен и измерений.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00008=Ты был призван сюда, чтобы пройти испытание огнем битвы и обрести великую славу.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00009=Cлаву? Да мне и так уже тут интересно.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00010=Эти врата бури ведут на Вороний двор, в один из миров Нексуса. Щелкни правой кнопкой мыши, чтобы переместиться туда.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00011=Эти врата бури ведут на Вороний двор, в один из миров Нексуса. Щелкни левой кнопкой, чтобы подойти к ним.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00012=Эти врата бури ведут на Вороний двор, в один из миров Нексуса. Щелкни по ним, чтобы переместиться туда.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00013=Эй, Утер, я тебе не зеленый новичок, забыл?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00014=Я в тебе нисколько не сомневаюсь, но здесь все иначе, и мои подсказки лишними не будут!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00015=Вражеский воин? Так, нажми клавишу "A" и щелкни мышью, чтобы его атаковать.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00017=Вражеский воин? Так, нажми клавишу атаки и щелкни мышью, чтобы его атаковать.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00018=Продолжай наступать. Воины отображаются на мини-карте.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00019=Утер, ты мне помочь не хочешь?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00020=Я-то уже прошел подготовку, а тебе это только предстоит. К тому же, с парой воинов ты точно справишься.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00021=Оттуда правда только что вылетел сияющий шар?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00022=Сфера регенерации. Подбери ее, и она восстановит здоровье тебе и ближайшим союзникам.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00023=Силы возвращаются ко мне!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00024=Это cфера восстановления. Она восстанавливает ману и здоровье тебе и ближайшим союзникам.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00025=Зажми клавишу «A» и щелкни мышью по земле: по пути ты будешь атаковать противников, которые тебе встречаются.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00027=Нажми клавишу атаки и щелкни по земле в точке назначения: по пути ты будешь атаковать противников.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00028=Неплохо. Похоже, до города мы наконец-то добрались.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00029=Эй, не гони... Никуда я не пойду, пока ты мне не скажешь, во что я ввязался... Что это еще за Нексус?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00030=Нексус — это космическая буря на стыке миров, времен и измерений.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00031=Все больше героев, закаленных в пылу битвы и равных друг другу по силе, приходят на зов этого загадочного мира.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00032=Так я здесь чтобы драться.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00033=И ради славы.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00034=Договорились.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00035=Диабло?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00036=Ты бросаешь вызов самому Владыке Ужаса?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00037=<посмеивается> Интересно... Каков на вкус твой страх, смертный?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00038=Понятия не имею. А страх что, можно попробовать на вкус?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00039=<рычит> Я пожру тебя!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00040=Первое впечатление от него, честно говоря, так себе. Надо поучить его хорошим манерам.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00041=Расскажи-ка мне, что здесь происходит.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00042=Этот мир называется Вороньим двором... и, похоже, владыка демонов Диабло держит его в осаде.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00043=Способности появляются на панели, расположенной внизу экрана.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00044=Чтобы победить Диабло, придется использовать способности по максимуму.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00045=Для начала попробуй применить против воинов Диабло «Пробивающий патрон».
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00046=Для начала испробуй на воинах Диабло «Пробивающий патрон».
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00047=Терпение, парень. Прицелься и попробуй еще раз.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00048=Нажми клавишу «Q», выбери скелетов и, когда будешь готов, открой по ним огонь левой кнопкой мыши.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00050=Активируй «Пробивающий патрон», наведись на скелетов и щелчком мыши открой по ним огонь.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00051=Правая кнопка — отмена способности. Левая кнопка используется для стрельбы.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00053=Нажми клавишу «Q», выбери противников и когда будешь готов, открой по ним огонь левой кнопкой мыши.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00055=Активируй «Пробивающий патрон», наведись на противников и щелчком мыши открой по ним огонь.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00056=Нажми клавишу «Q», выбери врагов и открой по ним огонь левой кнопкой мыши.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00058=Активируй «Пробивающий патрон», наведись на противников и щелчком мыши открой по ним огонь.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00059=Нажми клавишу «Q», выбери врагов и открой по ним огонь левой кнопкой мыши.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00061=Активируй «Пробивающий патрон», наведись на противников и щелчком мыши открой огонь.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00062=Да! Способности наносят больше урона, чем атаки оружием.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00063=Новые скелеты! Используй против них «Пробивающий патрон».
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00064=Впереди новые воины. Используй против них «Пробивающий патрон».
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00065=Отличный выстрел!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00066=Ты бы попробовал как-нибудь, Утер. Куда эффективнее, чем молотить противников этой твоей кувалдой.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00067=Запомни: пробивающие патроны могут уничтожать вражеских воинов группами.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00068=Впереди слишком много скелетов... придется отступить.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00069=Нехорошо... Парни теряют запал.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00070=Используй «Воодушевление», чтобы подбодрить союзников и усилить себя.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00071=Испробуй его на пехотинцах и продолжай бой!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00072=Любая задача мне по плечу! Вперед!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00073=Будь поаккуратнее…
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00074=С помощью «Воодушевления» можно увеличить скорость атаки — и твою, и союзников. Используй его почаще.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00075=«Воодушевление» усиливает и тебя, и находящихся рядом союзников. Используй его почаще.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00076=Под прикрытием воинов твои пробивающие патроны могут уничтожать скелетов группами.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00077=Воодушевленные воины сражаются со скелетами гораздо яростнее.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00078=Новообретенная смелость не поможет. Вам конец.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00079=Наши пехотинцы уже начали бой с Диабло. Разблокируй камеру и сам увидишь.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00080=Вот так. А теперь прокрути карту и посмотри, чем занят Диабло.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00081=Сгиньте в огне!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00082=Он ранен! Самое время тебе вступить в бой!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00083=Нажми пробел, чтобы в любой момент центрировать камеру на своем герое.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00084=Верни камеру на героя, чтобы продолжить.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00085=Камеру можно снова заблокировать, повторно нажав клавишу "L".
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00086=Если хочешь, можешь снова заблокировать камеру.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00087=Этот мир и все его грешные души будут принадлежать мне!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00088=Только не в мою смену.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00089=Диабло беспощаден. Используй против него «Пробивающий патрон».
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00090=В конце концов твоя душа будет моей, Джеймс Рейнор.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00091=Отлично! Но мы еще не закончили.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00092=Используй камень возвращения, чтобы присоединиться ко мне.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00093=Стой смирно, пока камень возвращения делает свое дело.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00094=<насвистывает> Как интересно...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00095=Это Зал Штормов. Когда начинается битва, герои попадают именно сюда.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00096=Наша цель — уничтожить цитадель противника и не дать ему уничтожить нашу.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00097=Из обеих цитаделей выходят воины, которые расходятся по разным линиям и сражаются друг с другом.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00098=Понял. Выносим цитадель Диабло — и бою конец. Вроде, все просто. Только вот напомни мне... зачем нам это?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00099=<разочарованный вздох> Знаешь... Не зацикливайся особо на таких вещах...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00100=Во-первых, тебе надо на передовую.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00101=Стежок хочет играть!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00102=Не самый мудрый ход... Напасть на форт в одиночку может только самоубийца.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00103=Воины помогут тебе нанести удар по цитадели. Держись у них за спиной, и ты избежишь урона.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00104=Берегись! Атакуй башни, когда они стреляют по кому-то еще.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00105=Молодец, парень! Ты отлично себя проявил.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00106=Что тут скажешь... Отлично получается, у меня талант.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00107=Воины и камень — это мелочи! Cейчас я вкушу твоего страха!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00108=«Вкусишь моего страха?» Это уже слишком... Ты в школу вообще ходил? Страх не имеет вкуса.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00109=Угу! Он прав! Страх нельзя есть.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00110=Видишь? Даже вонючка это знает.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00111=<разочарованный рев> Хватит!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00112=Минуточку. Я разве не умер?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00113=Не волнуйся. В Нексусе смерть — явление временное. Скоро ты воскреснешь и будешь готов снова вступить в бой.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00114=Надеюсь, ты не против, если я помогу? Это должно немного уравнять шансы.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00115=Конечно! Вперед, партнер!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00116=Седлай скакуна, мы возвращаемся в бой.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00117=Верхом ты сможешь быстрее вступить в бой.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00118=Чтобы спешиться, нажми на кнопку «Транспорт» еще раз.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00119=Берегись! Меня может и не оказаться рядом.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00120=Будь осторожнее. Опять я тебя спасаю.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00121=Собирай сферы — они восстанавливают здоровье и ману.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00122=Башни — серьезная угроза, но в первую очередь они атакуют воинов, а не героя.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00123=Нападай на башни лишь под прикрытием наших воинов.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00124=Уходи скорее! Вернемся сюда вместе с воинами, они нас защитят!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00125=Держись позади наших воинов, дай им принять первый удар на себя.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00126=«Пробивающий патрон» и «Воодушевление» помогут тебе эффективнее расправляться с врагом.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00127=Если забудешь какую-то команду, наведи указатель на верхний левый угол.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00128=Прекрасно! Осталась только вражеская цитадель.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00129=Что, нечего сказать, огонек?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00130=<рычит> Я отомщу тебе, Джеймс Рейнор. Мы еще не закончили!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00131=Это еще что за дела?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00132=Ты не один!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00133=Ха, посмотрите, кто попал в Нексус... Не ожидала тебя здесь увидеть, ковбой.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00134=Нова? Чувствую себя прямо как дома.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00135=Не расслабляйся... сейчас будет жарко.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00136=Ха-ха. Прямо как я люблю.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00137=Ну, красномордый, посмотрим тебя в деле. Я готов ко второму раунду.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00138=<Roar>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00139=Ты готов, Рейнор? Заварушка принимает опасный оборот!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00140=Я всегда готов, Утер...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00141=Если тебя ранили в битве, можешь вернуться в Зал Штормов, чтобы быстро восполнить здоровье.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00142=Как и раньше, наша цель — сразить противников и уничтожить их цитадель.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00143=Значит так: к вражеской базе ведут три линии. Нужно кого-нибудь послать на каждую из них.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00144=Ну, я вижу, ты все усвоил. Как только битва начнется, следуй за мной и будь готов сражаться.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00145=Убивая воинов и героев врага или разрушая строения, наша команда получает опыт.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00146=Опыт получает вся команда сразу. Все твои действия — составляющая общего успеха.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00147=Опыт и уровень обеих команд отображаются здесь.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00148=Когда голубая полоска полностью заполняется, наша команда получает уровень.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00149=Тогда вперед за новым уровнем.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00150=Отлично, мы получили новый уровень!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00151=Твои характеристики увеличились, а способности стали мощнее.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00152=Дельный совет. Еще что-нибудь подскажешь?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00153=При повышении уровня открываются таланты, изменяющие способности и стиль ведения боя.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00154=Неплохо! Уже чувствую себя сильнее.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00155=Теперь тебе доступна мощная героическая способность, которая может изменить ход боя. Используй ее с умом.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00156=Героическая способность, да? Руки так и чешутся.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00157=Черт. Что-то мне нехорошо.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00158=Ступай к исцеляющему фонтану. Щелкни по нему, и он тебя вылечит.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00159=Ступай к исцеляющему фонтану. Щелкни по нему, и он тебя вылечит.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00160=Ступай к исцеляющему фонтану. Щелкни по нему, и он тебя вылечит.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00161=Молодец. Когда пьешь из фонтана, здоровье и мана начинают постепенно восстанавливаться.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00162=Прежде чем снова испить из фонтана, подожди, пока он снова наполнится.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00163=Рейнор, уходи!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00164=Отступаю.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00165=Рейнор, нам нужна помощь. Мы собираемся «уговорить» пару осадных великанов к нам присоединиться.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00166=Уговорить?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00167=Поверь, это куда интереснее, чем ты думаешь... <перезаряжает ружье>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00168=Постой-ка рядом с этим маяком, будь другом.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00169=Вот так. После захвата лагерей наемников их обитатели ринутся с нами в бой по ближайшей линии.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00170=Так, предлагаю проводить этих осадных красавцев до вражеского форта и дать им разнести его в пух и прах.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00171=Осадные великаны весьма эффективно разрушают форты на расстоянии.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00172=Рейнор, нам нужна подмога. Попытайся самостоятельно захватить лагерь наемников.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00173=Не стесняйся использовать в бою свои способности.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00175=Рейнор, надо захватить ту сторожевую башню — так мы сможем наблюдать за прилегающей областью.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00176=Постой рядом, и сторожевая башня активизируется.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00177=Назад! Не пытайся напасть на башню без воинов — слишком опасно.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00178=Осторожно! Воинов, которые защитили бы тебя от этой башни, нет поблизости.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00179=Поторопись, нам самим с осадными великанами не справиться.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00180=Надо помочь Утеру, а то старик будет ворчать еще больше... хотя куда уж больше.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00181=Рейнор, мне бы не помешала помощь на этой линии.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00182=Так и запишем: почаще пользоваться этими способностями.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00183=У тебя осталось мало здоровья. Найди исцеляющий фонтан.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00184=У тебя нет маны. Чтобы быстро восполнить ману и здоровье, отпей из исцеляющего фонтана или перенесись на базу.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00185=Неплохо бы сейчас захватить лагерь наемников.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00186=Здоровья маловато, а фонтан уже пуст. Надо воспользоваться камнем возвращения и подлечиться на базе.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00187=Верхом ты сможешь быстрее добраться до передовой.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00188=Транспорт позволяет передвигаться быстрее. Вызвать его можно клавишей «Z».
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00189=Чего ты ждешь, шериф? Выбирай линию — и вперед.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00190=Ух ты, сфера восстановления! Как раз то, что нужно.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00191=Не забудь выбрать талант, парень.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00192=Враг захватил сторожевую башню. Если получится, ее надо отбить.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00193=«Пробивающий патрон» избавит меня от этой группы противников.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00194=Рейнор, используй «Воодушевление», чтобы усилить наши атаки!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00195=Используйте левую кнопку для активации способности, а правую – для отмены.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00197=Ты только что отменил способность. Убедись, что щелкаешь правильной кнопкой мыши.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00198=Правая кнопка отменяет способность, а левая — вызывает «Гиперион».
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00200=Ты только что отменил способность. Чтобы вызвать «Гиперион», убедись, что щелкаешь правильной кнопкой мыши.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00201=Запас здоровья можно восстановить, испив из исцеляющего фонтана или вернувшись на нашу базу.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00202=Не торопись. Прежде чем бросаться в бой с низким запасом здоровья, подумай: враг за тебя получит опыт, а мы потеряем бойца.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00203=Вернуться в цитадель можно с помощью камня возвращения, только держись от противников подальше или спрячься, применяя его.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00204=Эй! Ты не даешь мне вернуться на базу!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00205=Возвращение на базу — долгий процесс, вражеские атаки могут его прервать. Используй камень возвращения только в безопасных местах.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00206=Кажется, самое время вызвать «Гиперион».
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00207=Думаю, если вызвать «Гиперион» сейчас, этих парней можно вынести.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00208=А ты кто вообще? Рыцарь какой-нибудь?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00209=Я бы попросил! Паладин!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00210=Одна петрушка.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00211=Как это одна! Паладин — воин Света...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00212=Не утруждайся, приятель. Сейчас меня это не волнует...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00213=Нова, ты просто как бальзам на душу.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00214=Не могу сказать того же о тебе, ковбой.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00215=Эй, Диабло... <причмокивает> Кажется, это я сейчас наслажусь твоим страхом...

Conversation/Spooky18/Line00006=Кто поверг моего фантомного рыцаря? Ах, это вы... Мне следовало этого ожидать.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00007=Один из моих генералов повержен. Какие же вы назойливые.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00008=Перед вами призрачный дракон Алекстраза, аспект Посмертия.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00009=Аспект Посмертия, Повелитель воронов зовет тебя!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00010=<раздраженно> Как вы убили то, что уже давно умерло?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00011=Вы убили призрачного дракона? <насмешливо> Не думайте, что ваши злоключения закончились.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00012=Лесная ведьма, преподай урок этому миру!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00013=Королевская гряда поплатится за свое упрямство.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00014=Будьте вы прокляты!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00015=Когда же вы умрете?!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00016=Паучья стражница, у меня для тебя новая добыча.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00017=Покарай моих врагов, генерал. Не щади никого.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00018=Охота окончена, но война продолжается.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00019=Значит, вы одолели охотницу... <вздох> Мне надоел этот фарс.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00020=Вы же не думали, что все уже позади?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00021=Вижу, вы одолели моих генералов. Теперь попробуйте выстоять против рыцаря-дракона.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00022=Радуйтесь своей жалкой победе. Королевской гряды больше нет.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00023=Наслаждайтесь победой... в своем обреченном мире. <хохочет>

Conversation/Spooky18/Line00031=Все, с меня довольно.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00032=Это вызов самому Повелителю воронов!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00033=Нет...
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00034=Мягко говоря... вы утратили мое расположение.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00035=Вы ослабили мою армию, но ничто не остановит мой гнев.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00036=Сегодня Королевская гряда падет. Попомните мое слово!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00037=Герои, к оружию! Сокрушите слуг Повелителя воронов!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00038=Сегодня враг не пройдет. Королевская гряда выстоит.

Conversation/Spooky18/Line00040=Фантомный рыцарь Повелителя воронов хочет сжечь мой мир дотла. Погасите ее нечестивый огонь.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00041=Эта бесплотная воительница – генерал Повелителя воронов. Она падет, как и ее повелитель.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00042=Призраку не выстоять против настоящего рыцаря Королевской гряды.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00043=Не беспокойся, Повелитель воронов. Тебя ждет та же судьба.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00044=Повелитель воронов наслал на нас дракона? Какая глупость.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00045=Призрачного дракона заставили служить силам зла. Освободите это благородное создание.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00046=Надеюсь, дух этого дракона обретет свободу.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00047=Королевская гряда – мир живых. Посмертию здесь не место.

Conversation/Toy18/Line00001=Привет! Давай дружить! Я тут таку-ую игру придумал, хочешь поиграть? Тебе точно понравится!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00002=Так, вот игровое поле... А это ты... а вот кубики... карты... и наклейки... Давай начнем уже!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00003=В общем, ты ходишь по полю, выполняешь задания и получаешь здоровские призы! Кидай кубик!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00004=Вот это бросок! Теперь выполняй задание для той клетки, на которую встанешь!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00005=Для каждой клетки есть карточка, а на карточке – твое задание!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00006=Ура! Держи наклейку! Соберешь три наклейки – получишь коробку с секретом! Я сам даже не знаю, что в ней...
Conversation/Toy18/Line00007=Задание от Мефисто... Э-э, это что, Стежок? <вздыхает> Он хочет, чтоб мы его заштопали. Странная просьба... но ты же справишься?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00008=Все-таки мне нравится этот старый мишка. А куда делся Мефисто?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00009=Ой... <вздыхает> Я случайно сел на... то есть домик единорога случайно сломался... сам. <нервные смешки> Так что твое задание... собрать то, из чего мы построим новый!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00010=Ура! Получай награду! Так, это давай сюда... <фанфары> Угу... Где ж у меня был клей?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00011=А это особое задание! Мой Дехака... немножко поранился. Собери части других игрушек, они должны к нему подойти... наверное.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00012=У тебя вышло починить Дехаку? Ничего себе! Вот, держи, это тебе.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00013=У моего льва сели батарейки, а я не знаю, где достать новые! Может, его просто покормить воинами или еще чем? Не, ну а почему не попробовать? Ну, придумай что-нибудь, ладно?
Conversation/Toy18/Line00014=Неужели сработало?!.. То есть, конечно сработало! Ведь мы команда! Дай «пять»!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00015=Ну... В общем, кто-то, может, даже я, сломал оружие у Валиры... Надо срочно все починить, а то мне влетит от сестры. Вот! Вот твое задание! Нет времени объяснять!

Conversation/Toy18/Line00020=Круто! Получай еще коробку! В ней точно что-то интересное!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00021=Наверное, пора усложнить правила... Хотя бы раз в 200! А то игра слишком простая...

Conversation/Toy18/Line00024=Ты опять? <вздыхает> Ладно, призы вон там.
Conversation/Toy18/Line00025=Ура, герой прошел игру! Ой, это опять ты? А я подумал, кто-то другой... Ну, э... поздравляю! <нервно смеется>
Conversation/Toy18/Line00026=Ура-а! Победа! Салют в твою честь!
Conversation/Toy18/Line00027=А эта игра для тебя не слишком простая?

Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00592=Телепортация невозможна, если героя атакуют. Используй камень возвращения в безопасном месте.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00593=Прекрасный выбор!
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00605=Победи наемников, и они перейдут на твою сторону. Лагеря наемников разделяются по типам и отличаются уровнем сложности.
Conversation/TutorialVO/Line00606=Победи наемников, и они перейдут на твою сторону. Лагеря наемников разделяются по типам и отличаются уровнем сложности. Сначала осадные великаны, потом бойцы и, наконец, боссы.

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion01=Вы готовы к грядущей битве?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Alarak00=Владыка Аларак? Какой сюрприз...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Condescending00=Вижу, твоя раса находится на... ранней стадии эволюции.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Dismissive00=Я делаю то, что должен.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Fenix00=Феникс!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Что это за новый вид зергов?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=И почему из всех возможных союзников мне выпало сражаться вместе с тобой?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Я рад сражаться вместе с таким достойным воином.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Raynor00=Надеюсь, ты тоже рад вновь сражаться рядом со мной, друг Рейнор?

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Zeratul00=Я счастлив снова видеть тебя, старый друг.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Я должен сражаться вместе с зергом? Что ж, да будет так.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond00=Мне многое известно об искусстве войны.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond01=Наши враги пожалеют, что дожили до этого дня!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond02=Перед лицом опасности мы непоколебимы.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=Как и ты, Аларак.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Если твой разум еще не помутился окончательно, лучше помолчи!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Fenix00=Мы покажем им, на что способны тамплиеры!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Что? Я даже не стану на это отвечать.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Мне не нужна Кхала, чтобы понять, что ты об этом думаешь.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Враг падет под нашим натиском!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Raynor00=Я застрял в Нексусе и готовлюсь к очередной битве. В остальном же – приемлемо.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Tassadar00=Во славу Айура!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Zeratul00=Анон пор-гал! (Перевод: Настало время битвы!)
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Сочтемся после битвы, чудовище.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill00=Ты не знаешь, что такое честь.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill01=Какое разочарование.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill02=Ты ничто перед тамплиером.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill03=Разобщенные, вы погибнете.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill04=Низшая форма жизни.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillAlarak00=Редкое удовольствие.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillKerrigan00=Это за Рашжагал!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillProtoss00=Тебе стоило присоединиться ко мне.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillRaynor00=Прости меня, друг Рейнор.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillSpreeEnd00=С тебя довольно!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillTassadar00=Похоже, я превзошел тебя, учитель.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillZeratul00=Да скроет тебя Адун в следующий раз.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillZerg00=Я очищу галактику от таких, как ты!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Laugh00=<bemused laugh>
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal00=Я словно ощутил дыхание звездного ветра...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal01=Я не забуду твою доброту.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal02=Без твоей помощи я бы не выжил.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana00=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana01=Мне не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana02=Мне нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No00=Нет.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No01=Это неосуществимо.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No02=Невозможно.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Союзнику нужна помощь.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Мне не справиться одному!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Мне грозит опасность.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Уничтожьте вражескую цитадель!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Захватим этот лагерь наемников.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Разрушьте этот форт до основания!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Мы должны захватить эту башню.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель! Еще не все потеряно!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Все на защиту форта!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Охраняйте сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_KillHero00=Расправьтесь с этим врагом, сейчас же!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed00=Придет новый день.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed01=Сила в единстве.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed02=Так много вопросов, и так мало ответов...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed03=Кто создал Нексус? Зел-нага? Но почему они не оставили ни храмов, ни новых форм жизни...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed04=Впрочем, возможно, эти формы жизни невидимы... и контролируют нас с помощью сложных цифровых устройств. Своеобразной боевой сети...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed05=Возможно, их тысячи, и все они управляют нами одновременно! Аа-агх! У меня от таких мыслей голова болит.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed06=Интересно, чем дэлаамы занимаются в мое отсутствие? Надеюсь, они не стали снова менять планировку в зале совета? Терпеть не могу, когда они это делают.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed07=«Копье Адуна» совсем рядом... а фазовый кузнец Каракс опять куда-то пропал? <sigh> Сколько можно... Но так он хотя бы не донимает меня своими просьбами добыть еще соларита...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed08=Хватит меня донимать! Иди, вымещай свою примитивную агрессию на орках. Посмотрим, как им это понравится!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed09=Да, я говорил, что StarCraft – не то же самое, что Warcraft в космосе. То, что происходит в этих Heroes of the Storm, не считается.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed10=Да, мой корабль всегда со мной. И он приносит пользу, в отличие от ваших так называемых «питомцев».
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed11=Нелегко стать иерархом в столь юном возрасте. Куда теперь стремиться в плане карьерного роста?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed12=Нелегко стать иерархом в столь юном возрасте. Куда теперь стремиться в плане карьерного роста?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed13=Я молод только с точки зрения протоссов. А тебе следовало бы проявить побольше уважения к тому, кто старше тебя на пару сотен лет.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed14=Все звезды я узрел и бед хлебнул с лихвою, но что куда важней, я был... собою.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected00=Я получил еще один шанс.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected01=Спасибо тебе.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive00=Мы должны быть едины.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive01=Я не подведу.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec00=Мудрый ход.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec01=Интересно.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec02=А, так вот каков твой план.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec03=Дальновидно.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec04=Это будет мне полезно.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt00=Полагаю, твоя раса недостаточно... цивилизована.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt01=Не знаю, что прикончит тебя раньше — мой клинок или твоя глупость.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt02=Выхожу из медитации. И начинаю выходить из себя.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/TeamKilled00=Самый тёмный час - перед рассветом.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExLocked00=Чтобы победить, мы должны держаться вместе.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Харак эн вайаш.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Gift00=Я готов прийти на помощь.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Lockin00=Наше время пришло.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Purchase00=У нас с тобой одна цель!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial00=Тамплиер всегда готов к тренировке.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial01=Я готов к испытанию.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Здесь мы должны действовать взвешенно и осторожно.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Я ценю твою осмотрительность.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Время для размышлений прошло.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Пока мы медлим, другие сражаются!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used00=«Копье Адуна», огонь!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used01=Активировать луч воздаяния!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used02=Начать ликвидацию!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate2Used00=Да ослепнут наши враги!

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed08=«Копье Адуна» совсем рядом... а фазовый кузнец Каракс опять куда-то пропал? <sigh> Сколько можно...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed09=Хватит меня донимать! Иди, вымещай свою примитивную агрессию на орках. Посмотрим, как им это понравится!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed10=Да, я говорил, что StarCraft – не то же самое, что Warcraft в космосе. То, что происходит в этих Heroes of the Storm, не считается.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed11=Да, мой корабль всегда со мной. И он приносит пользу, в отличие от ваших так называемых «питомцев».
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed12=Нелегко стать иерархом в столь юном возрасте. Куда теперь стремиться в плане карьерного роста?
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed13=Как тебе моя новая броня? Предыдущая модель была несколько... нескромной.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed14=Я молод только с точки зрения протоссов. А тебе следовало бы проявить побольше уважения к тому, кто старше тебя на пару сотен лет.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed15=Все звезды я узрел и бед хлебнул с лихвою, но что куда важней, я был... собою.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected00=Я получил еще один шанс.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected01=Спасибо тебе.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Revive00=Мы должны быть едины.

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec00=Мудрый ход.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec01=Интересно.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec02=А, так вот каков твой план.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec03=Дальновидно.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec04=Это будет мне полезно.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt00=Полагаю, твоя раса недостаточно... цивилизована.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt01=Не знаю, что прикончит тебя раньше — мой клинок или твоя глупость.

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial00=Тамплиер всегда готов к тренировке.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial01=Я готов к испытанию.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked00=Здесь мы должны действовать взвешенно и осторожно.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked01=Я ценю твою осмотрительность.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased00=Время для размышлений прошло.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased01=Пока мы медлим, другие сражаются!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used00=«Копье Адуна», огонь!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used01=Активировать луч воздаяния!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used02=Начать ликвидацию!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate2Used00=Да ослепнут наши враги!

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Что это за мусор на МОЕЙ площадке?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Murky00=Хм... Говорить ты умеешь. А на площадке сможешь с лучшими потягаться?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Negative00=Так бы тебе и греть своей тушкой скамью запасных, будь на то моя воля.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Positive00=Идем. Матч вот-вот начнется.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/IntroResponse_Prime00=Покажем им, как играют в Сборной Преисподней.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill00=Это моя площадка!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill01=Я бросаю – ты умираешь.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill02=Я в ударе.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill03=Оп-па-ча! Ты без мяча!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Kill04=По локоть в кольцо!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillButcher00=Возвращайся в низшую лигу...
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/KillD3Hero00=<ухмыляется> Нефалемы не умеют прыгать.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowLifeHeal02=Под самую сирену.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowMana00=Мне бы маны.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowMana01=Мне нужна мана.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/LowMana02=Мало маны.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/No00=Эм, нет.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/No01=Это против правил.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/No02=Даже не думай об этом.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AssistHero00=Союзник в опасности. Помогите ему.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AssistMe00=Мне нужна помощь.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackCastle00=Последний бросок! Снесем их цитадель!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackMerc00=Эти наемники должны играть за нас.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Сбор у форта, устроим движуху!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_AttackTower00=Давайте захватим эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Противник идет к нашему форту. Все на перехват!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_DefendTower00=Не дайте им захватить сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ping_KillHero00=Пора вывести этого пижона из игры.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed00=Че-каво?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed01=Йоу, пасуй уже.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed02=Эй, не отвлекай меня от игры.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed03=Заткнись и следи за мячом.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed04=В Сборной Преисподней только одно правило: «не запори слэм-данк, и да не запорот сам будешь».
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed05=Уже целую вечность Сборная Преисподней и Все Звезды Небес находятся в Вечном Плей-оффе. Когда кончается сезон, правило «до двух побед» уже никого не волнует.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed06=В этом году я стану Самым Ценным Воплощением Зла. Понял, Диабло?! <злой смех>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed07=Смертные! Пока вы на площадке, я вам и судья, и присяжные, и палач!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed08=Ну, Империй, кто теперь зажигает? Ха-ха.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed09=Фанаты зовут меня Азмоданком за мои знаменитые броски сверху. Но лучше всего у меня выходят трехочковые.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed10=Сперва я разнесу твой щит. Потом – весь твой мир.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed11=Почему мы деремся за Санктуарий? Ну, там будет проходить финал, и всем хочется получить домашнее преимущество.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed12=Как же меня бесят эти нефалемы со своей показухой. Когда я был новичком, мы начинали с основ!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed13=Когда Малтаэль играл за Всех Звезд Небес, он был той еще занозой. Нам повезло, что потом он подался на вольные хлеба.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed14=Расскажу один секрет. Дело вовсе не в кроссах. Они на меня... даже не налезают.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed15=Раньше даже выпускали хлопья с моим портретом на коробке. Но детишки почему-то перестали завтракать. Понятия не имею, почему.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB00=Даешь заслон.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB01=Я никогда не пасую. <хихикает>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Reaction_CastingB02=Запомните этот момент.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Resurrected00=Я снова в игре.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec00=Мило.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec01=Как скажешь, тренер.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec02=Это добавит огонька в игру.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec03=Этого никто не ждет.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec04=Сейчас попрет!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt00=Как ты меня остановишь, если даже не видишь меня?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt01=Ты у меня в гостях!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt02=Что это за мусор на МОЕЙ площадке?

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Purchase00=Первый номер драфта. Да!

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitLocked01=Айда, на площадку!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitPurchased00=Хочешь, чтобы я банку полировал? Не лучшее решение.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitPurchased01=Я придумал новую игру, пока ждал тебя. Она называется «хватит тратить мое время, давай играть!»
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used00=Вот вам горячая точка!

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed01=Скоро вы все будете мне служить.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed02=Ты играешь с огнем, но я люблю погорячее.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed03=Я не был так уверен в себе со времен Бастиона.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed04=Думаешь, я выгляжу внушительно? Это я еще не принял облик летающей головы! <недобрый смех>
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed05=Так сложно командовать приближенными. Лень постоянно опаздывает. Ярость все время ссорится. Зависть считает, что Алчность подворовывает, Чревоугодие пытается всех сожрать, а Похоть... всех отвлекает.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed06=<храпит> Нефалемы! Тут! Там! Повсюду! <просыпается и ворчит> Эти проклятые создания преследуют меня даже во сне!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed07=Прислужники, помните: нет ничего ядовитее ребенка-нефалема. Одна-единственная слеза — и все.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed08=Не люблю пауков, Цидея — исключение.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed09=Мне адски хорошо, так что продолжай.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed10=Думаешь, только у тебя семейные проблемы? Я вообще рос с Владыками Преисподней. Когда мы ссорились, то вся Преисподняя ходуном ходила.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed11=Те, кто считают, что смертных грехов всего семь, явно обделены фантазией.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed12=Это начинает доставлять больше неудобств, чем мой пирсинг.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed13=Подождите секундочку, мне нужно написать серию книг об этой битве, а потом еще раскидать их по полю боя!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed14=Как ты смеешь называть меня «малым воплощением зла»? Я предпочитаю название «зло оптимального размера».
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed15=<рычит> У тебя что, Азмодан головного мозга?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB00=Вперед.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB01=Уничтожение.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB02=Вперед, слуга.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB03=Убить их!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB04=Убейте их для меня.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Reaction_CastingB05=Немедленно!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Resurrected00=Я возродился вновь!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Resurrected01=Моя победа неизбежна.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive00=Владыка Преисподней вечен!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive01=Мне нет равных!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Revive02=Небольшая задержка.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec00=Прекрасно.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec01=Это будет весело...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec02=Меня ждет победа.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec03=Интересно...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Spec04=Сила наполняет меня!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt00=Ваша судьба решена!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt01=Такое нахальство не сойдет тебе с рук!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Taunt02=Прости меня, но я сейчас согрешу.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/TeamKilled00=Никчемная победа. В итоге мы все равно возьмем верх!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExLocked00=Я истинный Владыка Преисподней!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Где прячутся наши враги?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Gift00=Все покорятся мне.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Lockin00=Время пришло!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Purchase00=Мудрый выбор.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Trial00=Узри мощь Преисподней.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_Trial01=Хочешь заключить со мной сделку?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Армии Преисподней рвутся в бой.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Тебя прельстила сила греха?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Да... Созерцай меня.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Меня манят битвы и свежая кровь.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used00=Ты узнаешь, что такое настоящая боль.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used01=Утони в пучине греха!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate1Used02=Ты боишься смерти?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used00=<смеется> Какая самоуверенность.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used01=Я погублю этот мир!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Ultimate2Used02=Разорвите их в клочья!

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Я ни с кем из твоей родни раньше не бился?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Теперь героями называют даже таких, как ты?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Хм. От тебя, похоже, будет больше толку, чем от Олафа и Эрика. Это будет несложно.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Ты та самая ведьма из Трансильвании?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/IntroRespond00=Я тут прикупил мечей, и мне не терпится пустить их в дело.

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Kill03=Надеюсь, у тебя записан пароль от уровня. Ха-ха-ха!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/KillArmored00=Вот что получается, когда в бою полагаешься на бронированный хлам!

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Laugh00=<dismissive snicker>
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ох! Я уже увидел врата Вальхаллы!

VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed00=Ты думаешь, ты кто, Томатор?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed01=Да окажись я по другую сторону экрана, я бы... Эх...
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed02=Мой колчан набит мечами, и я знатно умею ими швыряться.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed03=Да, я тут самый Лютый. Проблемы?
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Pissed04=Погодите-ка. Викинги – лучшие в мире навигаторы? Мы явно делаем что-то не так...
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Resurrected00=Ну, в этой игре у меня хотя бы бесконечные жизни.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Revive00=Я вернулся, детка!
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Revive01=Хороший викинг мертвым не бывает.
VoiceOver/BaleogBase/Revive02=Э-м... Сколько у нас жизней осталось?

VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed01=Думай, что говоришь.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed02=Клянусь, следующий, кто назовет меня Варей на Battle.net, получит топором промеж глаз.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed03=Бул-Катос, я прежде не молилась тебе, да и не умею я. Никто не вспомнит, почему мы сражаемся и за что погибаем. Важен лишь бой пятерых против пятерых. Об одном прошу: помоги мне стать лучшей в этом регионе! А если ты меня не слушаешь, тогда провались ты в Преисподнюю.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed04=Посмотрим... Сокрушить врагов — есть. Обратить их в бегство — да. Услышать плач их женщин... Ладно, это пропустим.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed05=Я не соня... я вообще жаворонок!
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed06=Блондинки веселые, зато с рыжими есть о чем поговорить.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed07=Да сколько можно?! Я что, самая рыжая, что ли?!

VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed09=Тебе когда-нибудь снился кошмар, что ты работаешь в одном нижнем белье? А я, между прочим, каждый день так хожу.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed10=Найду того, кто придумал бронелифчик, — немедленно прикончу.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed11=Вижу как-то раз — сидят наемники у костра и общаются. Подхожу и спрашиваю: «Простите, можно я вас перебью?» Ну и... перебила.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed12=Знаешь, я так долго искала настоящее PvP.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed13=Погоди, дай запишу. Так... правый щелчок — движение, правый — атака... Постой, а левый щелчок зачем? Ох, не люблю я этих новых средств управления.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed14=У нашего народа есть пословица: «Когда идет снег, надевай самую плотную набедренную повязку».
VoiceOver/Barbarian/Pissed15=Слушай сюда, умник. Варваре на базаре нос оторвали, а я – варвар.

VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Gift00=Твой союзник — мой друг.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Lockin00=Я буду сражаться за тебя.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Purchase00=Деньги потрачены не зря.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Trial00=Мои действия красноречивее слов.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_Trial01=Не терпится испытать свои силы.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitLocked00=Хватит прохлаждаться. Пора задать трепку врагам.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitLocked01=Ну давай же, у нас полно врагов, которых нужно порубить на куски.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitPurchased00=Не будем медлить. А то у меня ярости все меньше.
VoiceOver/Barbarian/UI_WaitPurchased01=Будешь таращиться — глаза выколю.

VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillDwarf00=Что, для дворфа мой отвар крепковат?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillLiLi00=Неплохо, Ли Ли! Давай поднимайся и попробуем снова.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillRexxar00=Стареешь, Рексар?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSamuro00=Мой отвар полезней твоего клинка.

VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal02=<хихикает> Как хорошо, что ты рядом.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana00=Отвар бы мне сейчас не помешал.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana01=Думаю, мне нужен отвар.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana02=Кому отвара? Чур, я первый!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No00=Нет, не пойдет.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No01=Не в этот раз.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No02=И как мне это сделать?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Быстрее, союзнику нужна помощь.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Мне бы не помешала помощь.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe01=На помощь, друзья!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Давайте нападем на их цитадель!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Захватим этот лагерь наемников.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Уничтожить форт!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Нам нужно захватить эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Этот форт надо защитить.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Нужно защитить эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_KillHero00=Кто-нибудь убьет героя?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed00=Эй, чего тебе?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed01=Назревают проблемы?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed02=Думай о хорошем. Позабудь о плохом.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed03=О, я знаю много интересных историй... Хочешь послушать? <пауза> Мой тариф — 9 золотых за минуту.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed04=Один старик мне как-то сказал: «Пусть тобой движет жажда!» <фырчит> Такой ужасный совет! <отхлебывает> Вот это дело!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed05=Домашний отвар — самый лучший, ведь за ним не нужно никуда ходить!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed06=Будешь в наших краях, заглядывай на хмелеварню Буйных Портеров. У нас всегда найдется работка.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed07=Один мудрец сказал: «Пустая кружка — это кружка, в которую еще не успели долить напиток». <отхлебывает> <прочищает горло> Кхм.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed08=Не надо шутить с отваром.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed09=Кроме отвара, неплохо бы пить еще и воду. Ну хоть иногда.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed10=Не все, кто ищет путь, потеряли его. В смысле, я-то сам, конечно, потерял... но не у всех так.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed11=Для некоторых путешествие важнее конечной цели.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed12=Смысл пути странника — постоянно наблюдать и пробовать... ощутишь вкус другой культуры, и жизнь заиграет новыми красками. А путь Темного странника... в общем, плохо заканчивается.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed13=Почему мы сражаемся — это словно спрашивать, почему мы играем в Heroes of the Storm. Чтобы получить опыт. Спроси что-нибудь получше.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed14=Если жизнь дарит тебе лимоны, делай лимонад!

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_Uhoh01=Мы должны продолжать бой.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/AI_Uhoh02=Нет времени оплакивать павших.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack00=Трепещи перед Закарумом!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack01=Во имя Света!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack02=Как прах пред лицом ветра!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack03=Да проклянет тебя Свет!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack04=Я выполню свою миссию!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack05=Свет да опалит тебя!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Attack06=Умри. И побыстрее.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Celebrate00=Мы справились!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Celebrate01=Славная победа, но война еще не закончена.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Comeback00=Мы одолеем наших врагов. Сражайтесь!

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Healed00=Гораздо лучше.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Healed01=Мои раны затягиваются.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Healed02=Спасибо тебе, друг.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroAgree00=Акарат с нами.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroAgree01=Тогда начнем.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroAgree02=Определенно.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroBoast00=Мне почти жаль наших врагов.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroBoast01=Битва не будет долгой.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion00=Вы готовы к надвигающейся битве?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion01=Готовься, друг.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Не болтай перед врагом о своих планах. Серьезно, ни слова.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Постарайся не застрять в дверном проходе.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Еще один нефалем! Полагаю, создания Преисподней стали сильнее?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=В эту войну втянули даже демонов?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_DiabloHero00=Давно не видела тебя в бою. Покажем им?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Ты — зло, и тебя нужно остановить.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Еще один недолговечный союз...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil02=Придет и твой черед, чудовище.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good00=Приятно, когда на союзников можно положиться.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good01=С тобой-то у нас точно все получится.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good02=Ну что, будем вместе нести свет и добро?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Imperius00=Каково это – биться наравне со смертными, Империй?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Каково это, хоть раз выбрать верную сторону? А, Леорик?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Lord00=Владыка Преисподней сражается на моей стороне? Конец света и правда близок.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=Малтаэль, разве я не убила тебя... несколько раз?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Mephisto00=Владыка Ненависти... Звучит грозно!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Мурчаль, ты точно не передумал? Из тебя вышел бы отличный ученик.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Ты действительно считаешь себя соратником, достойным меня?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Теперь, когда мы вместе, остались ли у врагов хоть какие-то шансы?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Тираэль, для меня честь сражаться с тобой плечом к плечу.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Думаешь, ты справишься, паладин?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond00=Я всегда готова.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond01=Мой поход привел меня сюда.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond02=Всегда.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Не стоит злить крестоносца.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=И все? А я-то ждала долгих пояснений, почему я никогда не одолею тебя, Азмодан.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Да, жутковато. Тебе стоит это на врагах опробовать.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=Эм... Что?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=В любом случае нас нелегко будет одолеть.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Быть может, ты расскажешь мне обо всем после боя, Декард?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Мнение демона меня никогда не интересовало.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_DiabloHero00=Давай сперва одолеем наших врагов. А потом подумаем, как вернуться домой.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=<вздыхает>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil00=Жаль, что ты сегодня не в стане врагов.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil01=Без тебя мир стал бы намного чище.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil02=Еще не поздно подыскать другого союзника?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=Вот это мне нравится.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good00=На все воля Акарата.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good01=Я буду твоим щитом.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good02=Вместе мы все преодолеем!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Imperius00=Что ж, Империй, и ты здесь. Похоже, сюда тащат всех подряд.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=У меня была компания и похуже. Не знаком с Линдоном?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Lord00=И тебе того же, демон.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=Мы на одной стороне, Малтаэль. И я не убью тебя... возможно.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto00=<осуждающе> Даже не пытайся. Лесть тебе не поможет.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Твои слова всегда исполнены мудрости, мой красноречивый друг.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Сейчас мы на одной стороне. Сосредоточься на наших врагах.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_No00=Я не удостою тебя ответом.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Мы снова встретились! Ха! Теперь нас не остановить.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Я тоже рада, Тираэль.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=Да, я. Знаешь, паладин, никто тебя не осудит, если ты не справишься. Вам ведь не привыкать.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Я еще подумаю, брать ли тебя с собой.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill00=Акарат помилует тебя. Я – нет.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill01=Я пришла по твою душу!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill02=Попытка не пытка.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill03=До скорого.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill04=Тебе не повезло!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillAngel00=Отправляйся обратно на Небеса!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillButcher00=Души погибших от твоей руки отмщены.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDeckard00=Прости, старый друг. Возможно, тебе стоит поменьше говорить.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDemon00=Ты и в этом мире от меня не спрячешься, демон!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiablo00=Это уже который раз, Диабло? Я сбилась со счета.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiabloHero00=Твое время прошло, герой.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillImperius00=Этого давно следовало ожидать, болтун.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillLeoric00=Отправляйся обратно в свой склеп, Леорик.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillMephisto00=Разве ты не должен быть самым умным среди братьев-Владык?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillNephalem00=Прости, нефалем.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Хватит с тебя!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillTyrael00=Настало время нефалемов, старый друг.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillUther00=Паладины. Ха!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillWhitemane00=Одной фанатичкой меньше.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh00=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh01=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh02=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh03=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh04=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal00=Чуть не погибла!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal01=Отлично, лекарь!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal02=Давай не будем больше так рисковать.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana00=Не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana01=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana02=Мне нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No00=Нет.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No01=Я не могу.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No02=Не сейчас.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Нашему союзнику нужна помощь!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Мне нужна помощь!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Мне не помешает помощь!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=К вражеской цитадели! Пора!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Убедим этих наемников сражаться за нас.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Штурмуем этот форт!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Захватим эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Обороняем цитадель!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Защищаем этот форт! Держать строй!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Защитите эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_KillHero00=Этого героя нужно убить. Как можно скорее.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed00=Здравствуй.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed01=Да? Тебе что-то нужно?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed02=Зачем ты щелкаешь по мне, а не по врагам и добыче? Что это за игра такая?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed03=Шутки? То есть, я должна пошутить? Ладно, попробую.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed04=Заходят как-то крестоносец, паладин и храмовник в таверну. А трактирщик у них спрашивает: "Вам темного или светлого?" <laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed05=... никто не понимает юмор крестоносцев.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed06=Когда-нибудь я очищу веру Закарума от скверны, и мой поход будет завершен. Чем я тогда займусь? Думаю, мне всегда найдется, кого покарать.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed07=Этот Нексус – странное место. Взять хотя бы добычу. Дублоны, кристаллы... а где мой новый легендарный кистень?!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed08=Когда носишь тяжелую броню, самое сложное – это почесаться. <complaining exertion> О нет, зря я это сказала...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed09=О, Акарат, благослови этот кистень священный, дабы рука, его предержащая, не дрогнула, разнося врагов нечестивых в маленькие нечестивые клочья. Милостью твоей, да будет так.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed10=Я ношу имя своего учителя, а она унаследовала его от своего. Когда-нибудь моя ученица возьмет это имя. А потом сама найдет ученицу и передаст его ей. Я пытаюсь сказать, что у всех нас одно имя.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed11=Наш орден состоит из самых разных людей, у каждого из которых своя история. Да мы прямо лига выдающихся закарумитов!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed12=Вчера один малый спутал меня с храмовником. Я ему: «Да ты слышал хоть раз, как я кричу "Славный удар!"?» А он: «Теперь слышал!» Такой шутник. Жаль, прожил недолго.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed13=Щелкнешь по мне еще раз, и, Акарат мне свидетель, я отсеку твой палец. Или чем ты там пользуешься, чтобы щелкать мышкой.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected00=Благодарю тебя, друг.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected01=Большое спасибо.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive00=Я вернулась!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive01=И снова в бой.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive02=Пора бы задуматься об ученице.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec00=Отличный выбор.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec01=Превосходно.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec02=Свет дарует мне силу.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec03=Так и должно было случиться.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec04=Думаю, да. Верно.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt00=Если в вашей команде есть настоящие герои – шлите их ко мне.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt01=У нас в ордене тебя бы на смех подняли.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt02=Да с тобой справилась бы даже моя ученица! Которой у меня нет.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/TeamKilled00=Бывало и хуже. Не теряйте надежду.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExLocked00=Приветствую, друг.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Нас ждет много битв.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Gift00=У тебя щедрая душа.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Lockin00=Долг зовет.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Purchase00=Мудрый выбор.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial00=Да, давай попробуем!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial01=Желаешь присоединиться к походу?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Ты продумываешь каждый свой шаг наперед. Умно.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked01=А ты любишь подумать.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Долг зовет нас, друг мой.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ах... В неподвижности есть своя красота. Но сколько же можно ей наслаждаться?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate1Used00=Небеса да покарают вас.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used00=Вера – мой щит.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used01=Ты не уйдешь.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used02=Стоять!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used03=Эй, лови!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used04=Дальше пути нет.

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes00=Да.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes01=Хорошо.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes02=Сюда?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes03=На то воля Акарата.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes04=Конечно.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes05=Похоже на правду.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes06=Почему бы и нет?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes07=Долг зовет.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Yes08=Я иду.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack00=Вперед! В атаку!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack01=Атакуем, враги ослабли!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Attack02=В атаку! Отдохнем, когда врагов не останется!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Caution00=Осторожно!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Caution01=Смотрите в оба.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob00=Лок'тар!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob01=Неплохо!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_GoodJob02=Ха-ха-ха!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Heal00=Рана серьезная. Скорее иди к исцеляющему фонтану.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Heal01=Ты в шаге от смерти. Исцелись, скорее!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/AI_Retreat00=Я возвращаюсь в лагерь.

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion00=Ну что, готовы, щенки?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion01=Барабаны войны зовут на бой! Вы готовы?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=Пф. Альянс.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_AurielSpirit00=Целительница душ? Странная компания. Рассказать кому – никто не поверит!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Ты вроде человек, а вроде... Хм. Я буду следить за тобой.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Демон? Пф! Вы только и умеете, что проигрывать!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Мой клан не одобряет союзов с силами зла.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Я тебя презираю. Не мешайся под ногами.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil02=И ты здесь? Ох, помогите мне, предки...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Гаррош, не жди, что все орки моего клана станут слепо подчиняться тебе!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Gazlowe00=Газлоу! Ха. Чувствую, будет весело.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good00=Ты же вроде из этих «святош»? Ладно, главное – держись за мной.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good01=Рада, что хотя бы кто-то здесь понимает, что такое честь.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good02=А, это ты! Могло быть и хуже.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Лок'тар!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_JunkratGoblin00=Держись за мной и взрывай всех, кто не с нами!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Ты тоже из прислужников Сильваны?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Вас что, трое? Смотрите, не отставайте!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Мурлок? Интересно, а этот как далеко пролетит от пинка! <смеется> Кхм, прости.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Я устала от слабых союзников.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Выглядишь грозно!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Вождь Тралл! Это честь для меня!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Узнаю лордеронские доспехи. Клан Песни Войны их хорошо запомнил, паладин.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Whitemane00=Еще одна фанатичка из Алого ордена? За что мне все это?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Yrel00=Дренейка? Неожиданная компания.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond00=Лок'тар огар!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond01=Моя кровь уже закипает.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond02=Посмотрим, когда откроются ворота.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Не волнуйся, альянсовская шавка. Орда выиграет за тебя этот бой.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Angry00=Я переломаю тебе все кости!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_AurielSpirit00=Целительница душ? Я что, умерла?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Butcher00=<Growls back>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Confused00=Что за шум? Кто-то что-то сказал?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Ты еще кто? Хотя, какая разница.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Demon00=Орки давно устали от ваших происков, демон.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Твое мнение меня не волнует.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil00=Тихо! Битва начинается! А с тобой я потом разберусь.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil01=Я тебе это припомню... Потом...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil02=Я здесь, чтобы биться с врагами, а не с тобой. Хотя...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Excited00=Превосходно!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=В этом я с тобой согласна.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Gazlowe00=Так себе. И еще... чешется все.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good00=Хорошо, когда есть союзники, которым можно доверять.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good01=Честь – наше главное оружие.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good02=Помни о силе.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Horde00=За Орду!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_JunkratGoblin00=Будешь много болтать – я тебе голову размозжу!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Странно слышать это от мертвого короля.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=Томатор? Это что, овощ какой-то?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Murky00=А еще говорят, что орков сложно понять.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Negative00=Просто замолчи.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_No00=Ты в своем уме? Разумеется, нет.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Positive00=Я как раз соскучилась по драке!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Ну коне-ечно!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Лок-нараш!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Uther00=Успокойся, человек. Ты мне тоже не нравишься.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Поговори еще, розовокожая, и пожалеешь о том, что вообще раскрыла рот!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Yrel00=Ты само благородство! А теперь заткнись и дерись!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill00=Кровь и гром!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill01=Это было приятно.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill02=Я оказалась НАМНОГО сильнее!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill03=Ну и что это было? Тьфу!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill04=Кто следующий?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill05=Только кости трещат.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillAlliance00=Альянсовское отребье.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillAngel00=Злые пошли целители душ.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillChogall00=Получай, предатель!.. То есть, «предатели».
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillCrusader00=Где-то я ее уже видела... Или мне кажется?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillDemon00=Легиону придется искать новых добровольцев.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillDwarf00=Альтерак принадлежит клану Северного Волка!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillGuldan00=Ты заслуживаешь худшего.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillHorde00=Так и должны погибать воины Орды.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillLeoric00=Возвращайся, и я убью тебя снова!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillNephalem00=Какая сила... ты точно человек?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillNightElf00=Ха! Нажьяку понравится эльфийская голова.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillSpreeEnd00=Твоя серия убийств закончена, ничтожество!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillSylvanas00=Ты мне не вождь...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillUther00=Тьфу! Паладины!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillWarchief00=Тоже мне, бывший вождь!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillWhitemane00=Самоуверенная выскочка!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh01=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh02=<large laugh>

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal00=О, да!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal01=Силы возвращаются ко мне!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal02=Спасибо. А теперь снова в бой!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana00=Недостаточно маны.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana01=Нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana02=Шутишь? У меня нет сил!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd00=Победа за мной!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd01=Честь – в служении.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd02=Славная была битва.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No00=Нет.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No01=Невозможно.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No02=У тебя разве нет других дел?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistHero00=Наш союзник в беде!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistMe00=Помогите мне!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistMe01=Сюда! Мне нужна помощь.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackCastle00=В атаку! Уничтожим цитадель!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackMerc00=Заставим этих наемников служить нам!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Нападем на этот форт!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackTower00=Захватите эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Защищаем этот форт!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendTower00=Не подпускайте врага к этой сторожевой башне!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_KillHero00=Убейте этого героя!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed00=Мок'ра!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed01=Чем могу помочь?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed02=Отвали!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed03=Хватит меня донимать!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed04=Ха-ха, мимо!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed05=Хватит. Включай PvP-режим, и разберемся, как воины.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed06=Я как-то встретила человеческую версию себя, всю такую блондинистую и правильную. До сих пор противно.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed07=Думаешь, 30 минут – это много? Я вот как-то сражалась в Альтеракской долине два дня без перерыва! Конечно, можно было управиться и побыстрее, вот только все решили отсидеться в пещере.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed08=Как-то мы с мужем разошлись в пустошах... Так через час меня уже весь Калимдор искал.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed09=Мне нравится, когда люди начинают объяснять, что орки – это такие благородные воины с трудной судьбой. Особенно приятно прерывать их рассуждения хорошим ударом по зубам.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed10=Тебя не удивляет, что орки-NPC говорят на всеобщем языке, а орки-герои – нет? Нелогично же.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed11=Что здесь вообще происходит? Я орк-паладин? Такое вообще разрешено? С каких пор?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed12=То есть не паладин, а крестоносец? А в чем разница? Это продвинутый паладин? Ладно, проехали.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed13=Перед поездкой не забывай проверять своего лютого волка на вшивость. Ты же не хочешь неприятных сюрпризов?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed14=Раньше я была командиром клана Песни Войны. Эх, как мы рвались в бой... Но потом начался кризис и пришлось подыскать себе новую работу.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Resurrected00=Предки хотели, чтоб я вернулась.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Resurrected01=У меня уже в глазах потемнело... Спасибо.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive00=Жизнь за Орду!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive01=Кто это сделал?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive02=Сила и честь!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive03=Воскрешение... и никакой слабости? Ха-ха!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec00=Сойдет.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec01=А ты знаешь в этом толк.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec02=Умно. Даже слишком.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec03=Главное, чтобы в бою пригодилось.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec04=Слава Орде!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Taunt00=Честь – мой щит.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Taunt01=Ты сомневаешься в моей чести?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Taunt02=Ты бросаешь вызов мне?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/TeamKilled00=Нас... Перебили...

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_WaitLocked00=Давай хоть разомнемся. Я устала ждать.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_WaitLocked01=Ты слишком долго думаешь!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_WaitPurchased00=Может, сделаешь уже что-нибудь? Не хочу становиться АФК.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_WaitPurchased01=Как здесь тихо... Ненавижу тишину.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate1Used00=Сейчас... вы... умрете!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate2Used00=Ни с места!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate2Used01=Я тебе голову размозжу!

VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_WaitPurchased00=Я жажду битвы. Когда мы уже отправимся в бой?
VoiceOver/DemonHunterAngelic/UI_WaitPurchased01=<вздыхает>Самое скучное на охоте — поджидать добычу.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill00=Свежее удобрение для растений.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill01=Именно этого ты и заслуживаешь.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill02=В следующий раз будешь думать.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill03=Теперь ты частица леса.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill04=Это было неизбежно...

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed00=Я — первая из дриад.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed01=Лес не нуждается в защите. А вот тебе она бы не помешала.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed02=Мы вернем себе то, что украли у нас смертные.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed03=У моего отца Кенария есть сила. А у меня — решительность.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed04=Не пойми меня превратно — у смертных отлично получается убивать друг друга. Но у дикой природы выходит все равно лучше.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed05=С растениями в Саду ужасов что-то не так... Чем их только удобряют?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed06=Я не та дриада, которую ты ищешь.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed07=Хочешь, я угадаю, как тебя зовут?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed08=Тебя привел сюда зов природы?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed09=И если кто-нибудь еще раз хоть одним пальцем…
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed10=Я заманиваю своих врагов, подражая человеческой самке: «Ах, я так одинока, так одинока!..»
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed11=Как я люблю природу! Все эти яды, колючки, удушающие растения! Так бы и любовалась днями напролет!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed12=Если женщина что-то просит, надо ей это обязательно дать. Иначе она возьмет это сама.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed13=Лунарой меня назвали в честь бабушки. Папенька всегда был таким старомодным...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed14=Назовешь меня Милуной — получишь не только передними копытами, но и задними.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed15=Большинство дриад свободно изъясняется на оленьем, кроличьем и птичьем языках, но я еще владею змеиным, медвежьим и парой редких диалектов скорпионьего. <hissing> Ш-ш. Ш-ш. Ш-ш-ш-ш!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed16=Готова поспорить, тебе никогда не приходилось бывать на вечеринке дриад! Мы выпиваем столько сока луноягод, сколько завсегдатаям Ярмарки Новолуния и не снилось!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed17=(instructing someone on how to move like a dryad) И пошла на меня, свободной походкой, от бедра! Прыг-скок, прыг-скок, прыг — и, конечно же, скок.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed18=Если женщина не права, извинись перед ней!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected00=Неплохо.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected01=Спасибо, друг. Это еще не конец.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec02=Отлично.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec03=У природы много даров.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec04=Я уже чувствую себя сильнее.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt00=В чем дело? У тебя аллергия на пыльцу? <laughs>
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt01=Должно быть, прежде тебе встречались исключительно милые дриады. Но я не такая.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt02=Из тебя получится неплохой перегной.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/TeamKilled00=Можете срубить нас под корень, но мы все равно вырастем вновь!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExLocked00=Интересно, смертное существо?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Приветствую друзей леса.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Gift00=Ты собираешься меня подарить? Я что, корзина с цветами?!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Lockin00=Охота начинается!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Purchase00=Да благословит тебя природа!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial00=Ну ладно, так уж и быть.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial01=Только недолго.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Я так скучаю по полям Калимдора...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Природа зовет меня.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Я ждала слишком долго.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Хватит уже меня рассматривать! Я не собираюсь перед тобой кривляться.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used00=От природы не убежишь.

VoiceOver/ErikBase/Healed00=Я со встречи с валькирией такого исцеления не получал.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Healed01=Ха! Кому теперь нужна еда?
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Healed02=Спасибо за исцеление!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/IntroAgree00=Мне нравится ход твоих мыслей.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Погоди-ка... Ты Афтику часом не родня?
VoiceOver/ErikBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Да это баг! Мы должны быть в разных командах.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Постой... ты из будущего и явно не враг!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/IntroQuestion_WitchDoctor00=Эй, ты мне кого-то напоминаешь! Хм... еще один колдун?
VoiceOver/ErikBase/IntroRespond00=Мы просто хотим домой!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Как здесь оказался морской змей? Да еще и такой маленький.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Да, да, у меня уже есть злейший враг, знаешь ли. И другого мне не надо.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=О, хе-хе! Приятно это слышать.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=А мы прежде нигде не встречались?
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Kill00=Лети в Вальхаллу.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Kill01=Раскрошил, как печеньку.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Kill02=Кто ж знал, что я так здорово дерусь?
VoiceOver/ErikBase/KillChogall00=Три головы лучше двух, здоровяк!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/KillDwarf00=Удачи в Асгарде!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Laugh00=<laugh>
VoiceOver/ErikBase/LowLifeHeal00=А ты хорошо исцеляешь. Даже очень.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ммм. Это лучше плохо прорисованного стейка!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ого, а ты расторопнее меня!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/LowMana00=Мана заканчивается!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/No00=Эмм, нет.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Эй, тут нужна помощь!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Викинги не грабят в одиночку! Все сюда!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Быстрее, атакуем их цитадель!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Эти наемники нам пригодятся. Захватим их лагерь!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Этот форт выглядит уязвимым. В бой!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Захватим эту башню!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Нужно защитить наш форт!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Мы должны защитить эту башню!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ping_KillHero00=Кто-нибудь, убейте этого героя!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Pissed00=Я быстрый и умный викинг. Быстрый и глупый даже до беты не дотянул.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Pissed01=А ты знаешь, что у Олафа двое детей? Ума не приложу, как он успевает их воспитывать, если постоянно где-то пропадает.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Pissed02=По мне, так в Нексусе нет ничего необычного. Хочешь странностей – пройди нашу с ребятами игру!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Pissed03=Почему Олаф постоянно ходит за Чэнем, разинув рот? Стыд какой!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Pissed04=Я однажды приготовил кашу «Минутка» за двадцать семь секунд. За это меня и прозвали быстрым! Понятно?
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Resurrected00=Моя стойкость вошла в легенды! Как и мое упрямство...
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Revive00=Я уже дома? Хм... еще нет.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Revive01=Так, никто мои вещи не трогал?
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Revive02=Мы снова вместе. Хе-хе-хе! Как в старые времена.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Revive03=Я снова жив!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Spec00=О-о, интересно.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Spec01=Это требует мастерства, знаешь ли!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Taunt00=Я не для того овощного монстра побил, чтобы на тебя время тратить.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/UI_Lockin00=Где мы окажемся на сей раз?
VoiceOver/ErikBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Мне кажется, на меня постоянно кто-то смотрит.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Ultimate1Used00=Я – король мира!

VoiceOver/ErikBase/What02=Эрик!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/What03=Привет!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/What04=Какой у нас план?
VoiceOver/ErikBase/What05=Тебе же нужна моя помощь!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/What_Evo00=Эрик...
VoiceOver/ErikBase/WorthIt00=По-моему, оно того стоило.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Yes00=Я на охоте.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Yes01=Я поведу.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Yes02=Быстро!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Yes03=Стоп! Куда это я? А, неважно.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Yes04=Надеюсь, ты знаешь дорогу.
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Yes05=Немедленно!
VoiceOver/ErikBase/Yes06=Викингов не остановить!
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Attack00=В атаку! Им не уйти!
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Attack01=Врежем им покрепче! А потом еще и еще!
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Attack02=Враги слабеют! Нанесем им удар!
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Caution00=Осторожней... что-то не так.
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_GoodJob00=Великолепно.
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_GoodJob01=Так их!
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_GoodJob02=Ха-ха! Я был рад это увидеть!
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Heal00=Эй, дружище, да ты на пороге смерти. Быстрее, к фонтану!
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Heal01=Давай к исцеляющему фонтану! Быстрее!
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Retreat00=Отступаю.
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Retreat01=Я отступаю. Но только на время!
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Uhoh00=Ужасно.
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Uhoh01=Дела плохи.
VoiceOver/Falstad/AI_Uhoh02=О, нет.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Attack00=Я тебя с землей сровняю!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Attack01=Прощайся с жизнью!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Attack02=Мой грифон еще не завтракал!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Attack03=Отведай-ка молота!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Attack04=Во славу Заоблачного пика!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Attack05=Вот вам всем!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Attack06=За победу!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Celebrate00=Ха-ха! Вот так-то!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Celebrate01=Да! Мы это заслужили!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Comeback00=Отлично! Мы с ними сравнялись! Задайте им жару!

VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroAgree00=Ха, точно!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroAgree01=Хорошо сказано.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroAgree02=В точку!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroBoast00=Пора поразмять кости!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroBoast01=Так, сейчас мы их уделаем!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion00=Проломим пару черепов?
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion01=Ну что, зададим им жару?
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion_Muradin00=Ну что, покажем им, на что способна пара дворфов?
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Ты только посмотри, маленький мурлок. Хе-хе. Что ты тут забыл?
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Гм, сражаться вместе с тобой? Просто... отлично.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion_Positive00=А, здравствуй!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=А потом он такой: «А разве Фалстад не умер?»
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroRespond00=Весь день этого ждал!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroRespond01=К доброй потасовке я всегда готов.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroRespond02=Конечно! Торопиться мне некуда.

VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Indeed00=<Reueses IntroAgree00>
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Muradin00=Я только за! Поехали!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ха! А еще говорят, это у меня язык заплетается.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Negative00=Э-э... надеюсь, ты не будешь возражать, если дальше я пойду один.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Positive00=Вперед! Зададим им трепку!
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Я однозначно выбираю молот бури.
VoiceOver/Falstad/IntroResponse_Threat00=Ты об этом пожалеешь.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Kill00=Охо-хо! Больно, наверное!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Kill01=Ха! Проще простого!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Kill02=Вот это я понимаю покойник!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Kill03=Надо было шевелиться... да и броню бы покрепче!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Kill04=Так... кто следующий?
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillAbathur00=Что это была за тварь?
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillDeathwing00=Не зря меня зовут убийцей драконов!
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillETC00=Отдыхай, буренка!
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillMuradin00=Что, Мурадин? Уклоняться не учили?
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillSpreeEnd00=Ничего, если я тебя прерву?
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillThrall00=Молот бури против Молота Рока: один — ноль.
VoiceOver/Falstad/KillTyrael00=Что же ты не улетел на своих крыльях?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowLifeHeal00=Ох, спасибо. Я был на пороге смерти.
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowLifeHeal01=Скажи спасибо лекарю, Быстрокрыл. Ха-ха! <птичье щебетание>
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowLifeHeal02=Хорошо, что ты на моей стороне.
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowMana00=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowMana01=У меня кончается мана.
VoiceOver/Falstad/LowMana02=Не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/Falstad/No00=Не, ничего не выйдет.
VoiceOver/Falstad/No01=Не-а, приятель.
VoiceOver/Falstad/No02=Не сейчас.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ping_AssistHero00=Помогите там союзнику!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ping_AssistMe00=Мне б не помешала помощь.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ping_AssistMe01=Кто-нибудь, дуйте сюда и помогите мне!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ping_AttackCastle00=Разгромим вражескую цитадель!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ping_AttackMerc00=Ну что, захватим лагерь наемников?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Разгромим этот форт!

VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed00=Чего?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed01=Дворф к вашим услугам!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed02=А мы летим, а крылья гнутые... а, да что там, отличные крылья! <игриво рычит>
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed03=Сделай бочку! Э?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed04=<грифон испускает газы> Фу, Быстрокрыл! Опять вурдалаков жрешь?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed05=<бурчание в желудке> Эй, внизу! Поберегись, у нас тут грифону нехорошо! <клекот>
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed06=Хорошо иногда выбираться из Стальгорна... не знаю, чего Бронзобороды все время сидят в этой норе.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed07=Слухи о моей смерти весьма преувеличены.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed08=Э-э, тебе тут в округе такой малец в красной рубашке не встречался? Все время за мной наблюдает.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed09=В мои времена на грифонах летали только посвященные. А сейчас это доступно даже гномам!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed10=Спасибо, что выбрали компанию «Заоблачные полеты Громового Молота». В полете вы сможете насладиться кинолентой «Пролетая над гнездом грифона».
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed11=Требуется подзаправка горючим!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed12=<кашляет, плюется> Фу! Дурацкие перья!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed13=Да, Алекс. Что там за проблема, а?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Pissed14=Удивительно, как Быстрокрылу удается так долго махать крыльями. Хлоп-хлоп-хлоп-хлоп! Вообще без перерыва!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Resurrected00=Спасибо, то, что нужно.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Resurrected01=Ха, чуть не убили.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Revive00=Эй, а я живой!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Revive01=Так, Быстрокрыл, пробуем еще раз.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Revive02=Я вернулся!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Spec00=Да!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Spec01=О-хо-хо!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Spec02=А ты что думаешь? <одобрительный клекот грифона> Ему по нраву!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Spec03=Не возражаю.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Spec04=Неплохо.
VoiceOver/Falstad/Taunt00=Эй, куда это ты собираешься?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Taunt01=Поди-ка сюда! Быстрокрыл хочет поздороваться!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Taunt02=След от молота бури будет тебе к лицу!
VoiceOver/Falstad/TeamKilled00=Один, два, три... больше наших не осталось.
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_ExLocked00=За Каз Модан!
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_ExPurchased00=Как дела?
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_Gift00=Уже лечу!
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_Lockin00=Полетели!
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_Purchase00=Лучше не придумаешь!
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_Trial00=Давай, Быстрокрыл, покажем им, на что мы способны!
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_Trial01=Отлично! К драке я всегда готов!
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_WaitLocked00=<зевает> Что, так и будем тут торчать?
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_WaitLocked01=Погоди секунду. <чешет бороду> Вот, так-то лучше.
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_WaitPurchased00=<прокашливается> Мы тут торчим, а у нас враги не убиты.
VoiceOver/Falstad/UI_WaitPurchased01=Эх... Разбуди меня, когда начнется веселье, ладно?
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ultimate1Used00=Верхом на молнии!
VoiceOver/Falstad/Ultimate1Used01=Ловите!

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion01=Все подготовились к бою?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Ты предал свой народ, Артас. Это самое тяжкое из преступлений.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Baelog00=Я бы дрался всеми клыками и когтями лишь бы вернуться домой. А ты?

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Слышал, в Штормграде считают твоих сородичей опасными.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Из-за таких союзников порой хочется воевать в одиночку.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Если я должен принять помощь, то пусть она исходит от тебя.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_RehgarSW00=(гневно) Это что, волчья шкура у тебя на голове?!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Думаешь, мы союзники? Когда закончится бой, я с тобой разберусь.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Мы оба короли, но вожаком всегда буду я!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond00=Настоящий гилнеасец всегда готов к бою.

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Ana00=Увидишь, что будет, если меня разозлить.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Не испытывай мое терпение!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Все, что я сделал, было ради Гилнеаса. Ты же всегда думал только о себе.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Baelog00=Веди себя потише, а то познакомишься с моими клыками.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Я рассчитывал на надежных союзников. Видимо, придется обойтись тем, что есть.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Erik00=Я ворген, В-О-Р-Г-Е-Н, ворген!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Kael'thas00=Мой народ превратился в воргенов, но ты из своего едва не сделал демонов.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Опыт в чем? В уничтожении своего народа или в том, как заставить его себя убить?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Lunara00=О, женщина-почти-олень.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=Сегодня я отблагодарю тебя от лица своего народа.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Сколько же от тебя шума!

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ты в числе тех немногих, кому я доверяю.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_RehgarSW00=(снисходительно) А, Регар. Орк, который пытается походить на волка.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=А твой народ скоро лишится своего.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Ты лишь взял имя волка. Я же СТАЛ волком!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill00=Умри!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill01=У тебя не было шансов.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill02=Умри как пес.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill03=Вот так мы встречаем незванных гостей в Гилнеасе.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill04=<прочищает горло> Следующий?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas00=Теренас, я искупил свою вину.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas_W00=Я сделал то, что было не под силу Теренасу.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh00=А теперь я примусь за всю твою грязную Орду.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh_W00=Ло'гош – не тот волк, о котором тебе сейчас стоит беспокоиться. 
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKael'thas00=Возвращайся к своему бесценному Солнечному Колодцу.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKaelthas_W00=Ты даже подпалил мне мех.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric00=Такова судьба всех недостойных монархов.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric_W00=Не волнуйся, Леорик. Я обязательно зарою твои кости. (хихикает)
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara00=И все же человек оказался сильнее природы.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara_W00=Похоже, природа сегодня на моей стороне.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion00=Прости, верховный друид. У меня не было другого выхода.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion_W00=Ты был прав, Малфурион. Дикий облик опасен.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpreeEnd00=У меня уже глаза налились кровью.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpree_W00=Я – вожак стаи!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas00=За Лиама! За весь Гилнеас!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas_W00=Наконец-то, я пролил твою грязную кровь.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther00=Ты был героем Альянса... но не Гилнеаса.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther_W00=Я всегда знал, что переживу тебя, Утер.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillVarian_W00=На какой я был строчке?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W00=Моя добыча!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W01=Спасибо за возможность поточить когти.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W02=Легкая добыча.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W03=Мною движет голод.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W04=Я лучший во всем.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh00=<Hearty, good natured laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh01=<Derisive laugh>

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal00=Благодарю тебя, лекарь.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal01=Пока я жив, будет жить и Гилнеас.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal02=Теперь можно и отдышаться. Спасибо, лекарь.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W00=<дышит с трудом> Еле выбрался. Спасибо тебе.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W01=Вырвался из пасти смерти...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W02=Лекарь, я обязан тебе жизнью.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana00=Недостаточно маны.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana01=Мне нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana02=Мне не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W00=У меня кончается мана.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W01=Мне не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W02=Мне нужно восполнить ману.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No00=Ни за что.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No01=Нет.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No02=Я не согласен.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W00=Не выйдет.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W01=Невозможно.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W02=Я отказываюсь.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Союзник просит о помощи!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero_W00=Мы должны помочь сородичу!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe00=На помощь!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Все ко мне!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W00=В атаку! За мной!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W01=Сражайтесь как один!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Покончим с этим! Уничтожьте их цитадель!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle_W00=Добейте их! Уничтожьте цитадель!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Захватим этот лагерь, чтобы усилить наши войска!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc_W00=Покажем этим наемникам, кто тут главный.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Пора разрушить вражеский форт.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost_W00=Снесите этот форт!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Захватите эту башню!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower_W00=Захватите эту сторожевую башню!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle_W00=Не подпускайте их к цитадели!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Наш форт не должен пасть!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost_W00=Защищайте нашу территорию!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Не подпускайте врагов к сторожевой башне!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower_W00=Не дайте им захватить нашу башню.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero00=Разорвите врага на куски!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero_W00=Убить!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed00=Чего тебе? Не докучай мне.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed01=Вначале научись почтению!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed02=Не зли меня! Я страшен в гневе.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed03=Глупцов вроде тебя заковывали в кандалы и за меньшую провинность.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed04=Однажды я повелел воздвигнуть стену, чтобы отделить свой народ от внешнего мира. Как раз из-за таких, как ты.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed05=Когда мы освободим Гилнеас, придется заново его отстраивать. Может, получится договориться с ребятами из Братства Справедливости...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed06=Ммм? Конечно же, меч – это просто для солидности. У меня же есть пистоль.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed07=Я хотел разместить волчью голову на флаге Гилнеаса, но юристы твердили, что это будет нарушением авторских прав.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed08=Стена Седогрива защищала нас от любых контактов с внешним миром. Потому что в Азероте, к счастью, еще не научились летать на такой высоте или телепортироваться в известную точку.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed09=Этот пистоль сделан в Гилнеасе. Самый крупный калибр.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed10=Как тебе крепость Темного Клыка? Часто бывал там в юности, но теперь у нее каждый день новые хозяева.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed11=Гилнеас целых 20 лет был отделен от остального мира. Так что я могу не знать ваших свежих шуток.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed12=Полнолуние? Сегодня? Нет! Да я же стану монстром! Не бойся, я пошутил. Я и так могу превратиться в волка и наброситься на тебя в любой момент.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed13=Как-то к северным воротам подошел Отрекшийся и начал вопить: «Сейчас я разрушу вашу стену!» А мы его в ответ окатили кипящей смолой. Вот смеху-то было.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed14=Кстати, ты в курсе, что Стену Седогрива видно даже из Круговерти Пустоты?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W00=Чего надо?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W01=Говори.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W02=<Menacing growl>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W03=Даже не спрашивай, где я прячу меч, когда становлюсь волком.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W04=Когда мы строили стену, никаких «тауренов» в Орде еще и в помине не было. Кто они вообще такие? Человекоподобные коровы? Дикость какая-то.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W05=Ночные эльфы были первыми воргенами. Они вообще стараются быть первыми во всем.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W06=В самой чаще Черной дубравы растет дерево, под которым любят собираться воргены, так как оно подавляет нашу звериную сущность. Это дерево приносит покой, но пахнет просто отвратительно.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W07=Продолжай в том же духе и скоро завоешь, как волк.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W08=Ты и вправду пытаешься меня задеть?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W09=Мой костюм сделан из шерсти. Стало быть, я волк в овечьей шкуре. Разрешите откланяться!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W10=<ворчит> Проклятые блохи! А, это снова ты!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W11=Я ничего не боюсь! Кроме, разве что, визита к ветеринару.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W12=На самом деле я большой любитель кошек.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W13=Кое-кто считает, что я жестокий правитель, но ведь весь мир живет по волчьим законам.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W14=Если гилнеасские докеры начнут забастовку, то сложно будет обуздать волчьи инстинкты толпы. <смеется над собственной шуткой>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected00=Сильных не берет даже смерть!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected01=Я благодарен тебе, лекарь.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive00=Гилнеас восторжествует!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive01=Это не самое страшное, со мной случалось.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive02=Я больше не подведу свой народ!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec00=Естественно.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec01=Достойный выбор.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec02=Сила проклятия растет...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec03=Твердость веры – оружие королей.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec04=Сила, чтобы выстоять в одиночку.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W00=Хороший выбор.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W01=Мои зубы стали острее.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W02=Порой старого пса можно научить новым трюкам.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W03=Хоть и наполовину волк, но человечнее многих.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W04=Я слышу вой Голдринна.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt00=Мой гнев сокрушит тебя!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt01=Я пристрелю тебя на месте.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt02=Ты смеешь бросить вызов королю Гилнеаса?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W00=Я чую запах страха.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W01=Только глупец бросит вызов вожаку стаи!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W02=Беги, крошка.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/TeamKilled00=Покажем им всю силу нашей стаи!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExLocked00=Пусть все познают мою ярость!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExLocked_W00=Теперь все познают мою ярость.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Мое проклятие – мое главное оружие.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExPurchased_W00=Мое проклятие – мое оружие.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Gift00=Раньше я не признавал благотворительности. Но это другое дело!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Gift_W00=Подарок? Интересно.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Lockin00=Да здравствует Гилнеас!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Purchase00=Я – вожак стаи!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Purchase_W00=Я – вожак стаи!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Trial00=Поохотимся?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Trial01=Сомневаешься в моей силе? Сейчас я тебя удивлю.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Гилнеас выдержал годы осады. Я готов к битве.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Нерешительность – признак слабости.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked_W00=Поторопись, я уже рвусь в битву.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked_W01=Нерешительность – признак слабости.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Настоящий вожак первым бросается в бой.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Скучающий волк – опасный попутчик.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased_W00=Настоящий вожак первым бросается в бой.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased_W01=Скучающий волк – опасный попутчик.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used00=Тебе не скрыться от меня!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used01=Охотничья метка!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used02=Теперь ты – добыча!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used00=Ощути мою ярость!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used01=Я разорву тебя на клочки!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used02=Сила зверя!

VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed04=Мне одному не хватает урона от хаоса?
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed05=Нет, я ничего не заметил. У меня вообще со зрением не очень.
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed06=Помнишь, раньше крылья, рога и копыта были в диковинку в мире Warcraft? Эх, ностальгия.
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed07=Увы, бедный Гул'дан! <Пауза> Я знал его... а вообще-то нет.
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed08=Как Blizzard могли добавить в игру монахов до охотников на демонов? Это же вообще не класс!
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed09=Знаешь, Тиранде уже 10 000 лет, а она неплохо выглядит... По крайней мере, так говорят.
VoiceOver/Illidan/Pissed10=Мой брат просто помешан на защите природы.

VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed08=И что, в следующем дополнении я снова стану человеком? Blizzard, определитесь уже! Человек, зерг, человек, зерг. Остановитесь на чем-то одном.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed09=Самое неприятное в разуме улья — знать, сколько зерглингов вылизывают себя в данный момент.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed10=Трудно поверить, но мои высокие каблуки — результат эволюции.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed11=Ад не знает большего гнева, чем женщина, желающая мести.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed12=Ты не представляешь, как мне сложно укладывать волосы.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed13=Не задавай коллективному разуму глупые вопросы.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed14=Невероятные псионные способности... Ха. Люди слишком громко думают.
VoiceOver/Kerrigan/Pissed15=Ты покоришься мне. Сопротивление бесполезно.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Выходит ты знаешь меня, ангел. И что помешало тебе вмешаться, когда Диабло уничтожал мое королевство?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill00=Не предают лишь мертвые.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill01=Я пресеку этот заговор!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill02=Одним предателем меньше!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill03=Никто не будет тебя оплакивать.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Kill04=Служи своему королю...
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillArthas00=Тут место лишь одному проклятому королю.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillAzmodan00=И правда, малое зло.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillBarbarian00=Отправляйся к своим сородичам-дикарям!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillButcher00=Это тебе за все то, что ты творил в моих подземельях.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillCrusader00=Может, хотя бы это заставит тебя умолкнуть.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillDemonHunter00=Передавай привет сестре.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillDiablo00=Это за моих сыновей! И за то, что свел меня с ума...
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillMonk00=Тысяча и один бог! И НИКТО из них не спас тебя!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Вы все недостойны.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillTyrael00=Справедливость – это ложь.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillUther00=Паладины... Терпеть их не могу.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillWitchDoctor00=Узри Бесформенный мир своими глазами.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/KillWizard00=Никогда не любил таких, как ты.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowLifeHeal01=Я уже думал, что мое время истекло.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowLifeHeal02=Я уже был на грани бездны.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowMana00=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowMana01=Мне не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/LowMana02=Мне нужна мана.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/No00=Этому не бывать.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/No01=Невозможно.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/No02=Нет.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Союзнику нужна помощь!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Помогите своему королю!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Мне нужна помощь.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Ping_KillHero00=Убейте этого героя!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed00=Как ты смеешь!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed01=Кто тревожит короля Хандараса?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed02=Я уже мертв. И если меня убить, каким я стану? Более мертвым? Самым мертвым... Живым?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed03=Манипулировать семьей, королевством и душой великого воплощения зла всегда нелегко.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed04=Слуги прозвали меня безумцем... параноиком! <ухмылка> Разве это паранойя – думать, что все хотят тебя убить? А? А? Правда? Но что, если действительно хотят?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed05=Старые кости боятся лишь остеопороза.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed06=Кто-нибудь еще слышит эти голоса? Что? Нет... Да! <злой и безумный смех> Да, скоро ОНИ ВСЕ услышат.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed07=Эй, ты! Руки прочь от моей сахарной косточки!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed08=Я Король-скелет, а не король скелетов. Разница, вроде, небольшая, но принципиальная.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed09=Герои? <ухмылка> Это те проходимцы, что так и норовят вломиться в мой дом, разбить мою коллекцию урн, оживить меня, снова убить, а затем просто уйти, оставив белые предметы валяться на полу? О да, настоящие герои.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed10=Скоро опять польет дождь, костями чувствую.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed11=Тьма следит за мной. Я на нее тоже подписан, но пишет она не так часто.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed12=Хочешь узнать, откуда у меня эти шрамы? Да шучу. Откуда на костях шрамы?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed13=Я себя таким не знаю, и в пронзительной тиши по кусочкам собираю кости, зубы и хрящи... <вздох> Слезная кость, лобная кость, некому поднять, некому помочь...
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Pissed14=Пейте, дети, молоко. <зловеще> Для костей полезно.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Resurrected00=Кто вернул меня в мир живых?
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Resurrected01=Вечный покой подождет.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive00=Меня не удержать в могиле!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive01=Я буду править вечно!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Revive02=Нельзя убить того, у кого нет жизни.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec00=Да. Это достойно короля.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec01=Это мое по праву!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec02=Король не заслуживает меньшего.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec03=Мастерский выбор.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Spec04=Мудрый выбор.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Taunt00=Беги или умри.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Lockin00=Вы все будете страдать!
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Purchase00=Решение мудрого человека.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Trial00=Ты не пожалеешь об этом.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_Trial01=Долгожданная возможность отомстить.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Ты недооцениваешь силу моего гнева.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Выпусти меня из этого чистилища.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Наши враги не медлят. Не должны и мы.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Шевелись, пока я не отсек твою голову.

VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes06=Да.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes07=Да будет так.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes08=Как скажешь.
VoiceOver/LeoricBase/Yes09=Сейчас же.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Attack00=Сокрушим их. Не отступать.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Attack01=Усилить напор. Мы сломим их волю.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Attack02=Убить их. Никто не устоит перед нашим гневом.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Caution00=Осторожно. Лишние смерти пользы не принесут.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_GoodJob00=Старо, но эффективно.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_GoodJob01=Ты неплохо справляешься.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_GoodJob02=Еще один враг пал.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/AI_Heal00=Исцелись. Раненые союзники бесполезны.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack02=Никому не будет прощения.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack03=Я не потерплю измены.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack04=Я смету всех, кто восстанет против меня.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Attack05=Познай мой гнев!

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree00=Надеюсь, ты отвечаешь за свои слова...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree01=Гнев станет твоим могучим союзником.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroAgree02=На этот раз нас никто не остановит.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroBoast00=Мне покорилась тысяча миров. И этот не станет исключением.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroBoast01=Тьма поглотит их.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion00=Надеюсь, все готовы к грядущей войне.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion01=Я готов. А ты?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Я чувствую твое стремление управлять Тьмой. Но ты не достоин.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Демон, я чувствую Тьму внутри тебя. Ее меньше, чем в остальных, но достаточно, чтобы служить мне.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Интересно. Ты стоишь перед Владыкой Тьмы, но не испытываешь страха...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Хм... В тебе есть и Свет, и Тьма... Но никто не может служить двум хозяевам вечно.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Темное создание. Служи Вечной Империи, и будешь жить.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Твоя мощь послужит Вечной Империи, демон. Не противься, или я заставлю тебя силой.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Monk00=Человек. В тебе я чувствую лишь покой и тишину. Но почему ты не мертв?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Ты полон ненависти. Присоединяйся ко мне, и ты свершишь возмездие, к которому так стремишься.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Не беспокойся. Я и раньше покорял целые миры в одиночку.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Думаю, ты принесешь мне пользу. Будем надеяться, что я прав.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Создание Света... Вечная Империя уже встречала таких, как ты. Нам понравились их страдания.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond00=Меня тревожит твоя слабость.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond01=Я спрашиваю тебя о том же.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond02=Подумай лучше о своих собственных проблемах.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Ana00=Ты мне еще пригодишься. Поэтому я стерплю твою наглость. Пока что.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Король, считающий себя владыкой мертвых... Но мои наблюдения говорят об ином.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Скоро увидишь.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Я не слышал этого имени с давних пор... Повтори его, и ты пожалеешь.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Ты живешь только потому, что я так решил. Не вынуждай меня пожалеть о своей доброте.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Demon00=Ты мне еще пригодишься. Поэтому я стерплю твою наглость. Пока что.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Твой тон напомнил мне о множестве тех, кого я убил. Подумай еще раз, демон.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Monk00=Я не тот, за кого ты меня принял, человек. Считай, тебе повезло, что мы не знакомы.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Murky00=Если ты жаждешь этого, я не буду тебя сдерживать.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Negative00=Довольно.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Positive00=Довольно любезностей. У нас много дел.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Да, создание Света. Поддайся страху, и Тьма поглотит тебя.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill00=Это было слишком просто.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill01=Тебе не хватает уверенности.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill02=Империя не прощает измены.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill03=Не впечатляет.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill04=Вопрос решен.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillArthas00=Смерть всюду следует за тобой, но ты ей не хозяин.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillAzmodan00=Зачем ты противишься, демон? Наши стремления схожи.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillBarbarian00=Тебе стоило носить настоящую броню.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillButcher00=Сколько гнева... Какая ненависть. Ты будешь служить мне, чудовище.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillCrusader00=Слишком много болтовни, крестоносец.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDemonHunter00=Ты носишь в душе Тьму. Но ты не была в ней рождена.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDiablo00=Вечной Империи пригодится твоя сила, Диабло. Присоединяйся ко мне.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillMonk00=Молись каким угодно богам. Они не спасут тебя от меня.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillSpreeEnd00=Тебе никогда не сравниться со мной.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillTyrael00=Интересно. Ангел? Или притворяющееся им создание из света?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillUther00=Все несущие Свет будут уничтожены.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWitchDoctor00=Ты играешь с силами, которые не можешь постичь.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWizard00=Ты... Ты не она. Но и твоя смерть меня порадует.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal01=Смерть отступила от меня.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowLifeHeal02=Я был слишком близко к смерти...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana00=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana01=Мне не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/LowMana02=Мне нужна мана.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No00=Это невозможно.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No01=Не вынуждай меня уничтожать тебя.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/No02=Ни за что.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistHero00=Союзник не справляется.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe00=Ко мне.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AssistMe01=Сюда, быстро!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackCastle00=Цитадель. Уничтожьте ее.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackMerc00=«Убедите» этих наемников присоединиться к нам.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Сметите их укрепления.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_AttackTower00=Эта сторожевая башня будет нам полезна.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Не дайте разрушить этот форт.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_KillHero00=Покажите этому герою всю мощь Тьмы.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed00=Что?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed01=Ты испытываешь мое терпение. Это неразумно.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed02=Вечная Империя поглотила множество миров. Тьма же подчинила моей воле всю их мощь.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed03=Ведомая моей рукой, Империя сокрушила почти всех врагов. Кроме одного. Почему эти Астропринцессы такие упорные? Нет, дело не в силе любви, хватит повторять эту чушь.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed04=Я – космолорд, и я твой отец.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed05=Итак, мы заключили сделку. Хотя постой. Я изменяю условия. Да, так лучше. Хм... Можно изменить и здесь... Да, ДА! Она нравится мне все больше!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed06=Ты недооцениваешь силу Тьмы. Не стоит, правда. Тьма от этого впадает в истерию, вымещает на всех агрессию, оставляет всюду обидные записки...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed07=Если когда-нибудь захочешь построить колоссальное и непрактичное супероружие, не экономь на качестве. Даже самый мелкий изъян может привести к катастрофе.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed08=Космолордов всегда двое. Учитель и ученик. Наши встречи проходят тайно... и говорит лишь один.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed09=Да, сила Тьмы имеет красноватый отблеск. И что?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed10=<angry exertion> Этот шлем постоянно запотевает. <SFX: Squeegee sounds> Да, так лучше.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed11=Кто-то считает, что название «Вечная Империя» звучит самонадеянно. Погоди-ка, я хотел сказать «считал». Очень важно использовать правильное время, когда говоришь о мертвых.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed12=Нет, вся эта подсветка не выполняет никакой практической функции. Но... когда у тебя механическое тело, его можно вот так украсить и... прокачать.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed13=Какая же космоопера обходится без хора толстых пришельцев?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed14=Ты даже не представляешь, сколько батареек я расходую каждый день.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed15=Об этом не говорят, но в космосе очень, очень скучно. Он безграничен и в основном пуст. А там, где не пуст, живут одни идиоты.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected00=Вечная служба. Бесконечная преданность.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected01=Превосходно, слуга империи.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive00=Все возвращается к исходной точке.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive01=Я вечен, как и моя империя.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive02=Что ж... Продолжим наши изыскания.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive03=От меня так просто не избавиться.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive04=Я не умираю. И не живу.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec00=Тьма сгущается.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec01=Наших врагов ждут истинные страдания.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec02=Хм, одобряю.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec03=Достойный выбор.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec04=Прекрасно, мне это пригодится.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt00=Ты ничтожество.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt01=Иди сюда. Встреть свою судьбу.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt02=Я сам с тобой разберусь.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/TeamKilled00=Не-е-е-ет!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExLocked00=Надеюсь, ты беспокоишь меня по важной причине.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExPurchased00=Ах, мне знакомо это ощущение...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Gift00=Как пожелаешь.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Lockin00=Эта галактика обречена.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Purchase00=Слава Вечной Империи.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial00=Ах, еще один непокоренный мир на моем пути.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial01=Ты жаждешь демонстрации силы? Ты ее получишь.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked00=Будь со мной, и мы станем править галактикой.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked01=Мое терпение не безгранично.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased00=Учти. Если тебе надоест ждать, я останусь безучастен.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased01=Как много звезд... Придет время, и каждая из них будет моей.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used00=Никому не уйти от судьбы.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used01=Теперь вы у меня в руках.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used02=Добро пожаловать на арену судьбы.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Yes00=Понимаю.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Yes01=Мы выступаем.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Yes02=Как я и желал.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Yes03=Это было неизбежно.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Yes04=Да, мой учитель.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Yes05=Трепещите перед тьмой.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Yes06=Хорошо.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Yes07=Сейчас же.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Yes08=Хитрый ход.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Yes09=Вперед.
VoiceOver/LiLi/AI_Attack00=Быстрее, надо ударить в уязвимую точку! Вы знаете, куда.
VoiceOver/LiLi/AI_Attack01=Сейчас начнется веселье!
VoiceOver/LiLi/AI_Attack02=В бой!!!
VoiceOver/LiLi/AI_Caution00=Будьте осторожны!
VoiceOver/LiLi/AI_GoodJob00=Ого! Это было так здорово!
VoiceOver/LiLi/AI_GoodJob01=Ого! Отлично!
VoiceOver/LiLi/AI_GoodJob02=Прекрасно!
VoiceOver/LiLi/AI_Heal00=Эй, тебе точно пора к исцеляющему фонтану.
VoiceOver/LiLi/AI_Heal01=Выглядишь не очень. Ступай-ка к исцеляющему фонтану!

VoiceOver/LiLi/AI_Uhoh02=Все наладится.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Attack00=Я знаю отличный прием!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Attack01=Я тебя не боюсь.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Attack02=Ты злючка!

VoiceOver/LiLi/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/LiLi/LowLifeHeal00=Ты лучше всех! Тс-с, только никому не говори.
VoiceOver/LiLi/LowLifeHeal01=Ух, еле выжила.
VoiceOver/LiLi/LowLifeHeal02=Спасибо! То, что нужно.
VoiceOver/LiLi/LowMana00=Маловато маны.
VoiceOver/LiLi/LowMana01=Мне бы не помешало маны побольше.
VoiceOver/LiLi/LowMana02=У меня совсем мало маны.
VoiceOver/LiLi/No00=Нет уж. Не пойдет.
VoiceOver/LiLi/No01=Ну, это вообще невозможно.
VoiceOver/LiLi/No02=Можно было и догадаться, что я этого не могу!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_AssistHero00=Похоже, союзнику нужна помощь.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_AssistMe00=Эй, сюда, на помощь!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_AssistMe01=Не бросайте меня одну!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_AttackCastle00=О! Давайте атаковать цитадель!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_AttackMerc00=Давайте захватим лагерь наемников!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Так, кто хочет напасть на форт?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_AttackTower00=Хорошо бы нам захватить сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_DefendCastle00=Все на защиту цитадели!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Нужно защитить форт!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_DefendTower00=Противник не должен захватить эту башню!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ping_KillHero00=Знаете, кто-то должен остановить этого героя!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed00=Привет!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed01=Хочешь что-то сказать?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed02=Дядя меня куда только ни брал! Я даже не знаю, куда нас на этот раз занесло!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed03=А тебе приходилось бывать в Громовом Утесе? Таурены там целый город построили... шатры на плоскогорье поставили. <задумчиво> Я вот думаю, а если надо... ну, знаешь... до ветру... Высоко же...
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed04=Не пей слишком много целительного отвара, а то поглупеешь. И потолстеешь! И разленишься!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed05=Самое замечательное в Нексусе то, что каждые двадцать минут я попадаю в новый мир!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed06=Я родилась на спине гигантской черепахи, плывущей по океану. А представляешь, если этот океан тоже был на спине черепахи, только побольше? И... (взволнованно) Подумать только! А вдруг мы живем на сплошных черепахах? <чрезмерно взволнована и тяжело дышит>
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed07=Уф... Ску-ко-ти-и-и-ища!! Давай уже что-нибудь сделаем!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed08=А кто-нибудь еще задумывался, откуда берутся эти странные воины? Они же даже не говорят... Эй, ау! Слышишь меня?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed09=Слушай... Ты так к каждому встречному пристаешь? Как-то это... странновато.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed10=<вздыхает> Ну вот, теперь я просто грустная панда.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed11=Жизнь — это приключение! За исключением тех моментов, когда не очень. Я как-то не уверена... но жизнь — это нечто! Точно... жизнь — это нечто!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed12=Э-э, гм... а мы разве не должны сражаться? Конечно, приятно бывает поболтать, но, наверное, нас заждались союзники...
VoiceOver/LiLi/Pissed13=А тебе никогда не хотелось все бросить и отправиться в путешествие? В мире есть столько интересных вещей!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Resurrected00=Ух ты, спасибо. Мне как раз нужна была помощь!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Resurrected01=Благодарю за спасение!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Revive00=Да уж, для врагов нет запрещенных приемов.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Revive01=Кем надо быть, чтобы поднять руку на маленькую девочку?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Revive02=Ох... до сих пор все как в тумане.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Spec00=Отлично!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Spec01=Ну, погодите!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Spec02=Ой, здорово! Мне нравится!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Spec03=То, что надо!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Spec04=Никогда так раньше не делала!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Taunt00=Ну ты и тупица!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Taunt01=Эй, растяпа! <пауза> Нет, не ты, вот ты... хотя вы все тут не очень.
VoiceOver/LiLi/Taunt02=<насмешливо> Думаешь, у тебя есть шансы против Буйного Портера?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Taunt03=<Raspberry noise>
VoiceOver/LiLi/TeamKilled00=Как-то слишком быстро все произошло.
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_ExLocked00=Привет!
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_ExPurchased00=Как дела?
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_Gift00=Лучший твой подарочек — это я!
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_Lockin00=Навстречу приключениям!
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_Purchase00=Ты точно не пожалеешь!
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_Trial00=Я тебе понравлюсь, уверена.
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_Trial01=Лучше присядь: это будет сногсшибательно!
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_WaitLocked00=Ух ты, полосочки с подсветкой!
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_WaitLocked01=А я тебя вижу!
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ау, ты еще там?
VoiceOver/LiLi/UI_WaitPurchased01=Какая ску-у-у-ука. Может, уже пойдем?
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ultimate1Used00=Эй! Держи!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ultimate1Used01=Да! Напитки за счет заведения!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ultimate1Used02=Вкусно... и так полезно!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ultimate1Used03=Сама варила!
VoiceOver/LiLi/Ultimate2Used00=Вперед, водяной змей!

VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed12=Трансформация в реактивный истребитель? Круто. Трансформация в пистолет? Глупо.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Pissed13=Подключаюсь к меха-кхале. <SFX: Modem Sound interrupted by unintelligible female voice> Мам! Освободи линию!

VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes00=Ответ положительный.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes01=Направление принято.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes02=Выполняю.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes03=Да, конечно.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes04=Включаю ускорители.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes05=Укажи мне врага.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes06=Пока все не станут едины.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes07=Понял.
VoiceOver/MechaTassadar/Yes08=Определяю план полета.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Attack00=Атакуйте! Победа у нас в руках!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Attack01=Это наш шанс! Нападаем!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Attack02=Поднажмите, мы загнали их в угол!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Caution00=Осторожно, тут что-то не так.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_GoodJob00=Вот так и надо!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_GoodJob01=Мы — отличная команда.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_GoodJob02=Так держать!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Heal00=Беги к фонтану. Мои наниты чудес не творят.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Heal01=Слушай доктора. Беги к исцеляющему фонтану.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Retreat00=Отступаю. Скоро вернусь.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Retreat01=Тут становится жарко... Нужно на время отступить.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Uhoh00=О, нет, нет, нет!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Uhoh01=Союзник погиб!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/AI_Uhoh02=Я не дам тебе умереть!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack00=Интенсивная терапия!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack01=Приступаю к делу.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack02=А теперь будет очень больно!

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack04=Тебе в травмпункт.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack05=Стерилизую инструмент.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Attack06=Получай!

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Healed01=Спасибо. Хорошо, что ты под рукой.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Healed02=Люблю работать с профессионалами.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroAgree00=И не говори.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroAgree01=Я прикрою.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroAgree02=Держимся вместе, ладно?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroBoast00=Помни: вместе мы непобедимы.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroBoast01=У этих ребят вообще нет шансов.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion00=Приступим к бою, солдат?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion01=Учти, противник подготовился к бою.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=Королева Клинков.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Погоди, тут сказано: «Пол — мужской». Как же ты откладываешь яйца?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Работать с тобой? Просто замечательно...
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Да ты — крепкий орешек. Давай действовать сообща!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Protoss00=Протоссы.... Просто чудесно.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Raynor00=Я тебя подстрахую, командир Рейнор.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_SgtHammer00=Эй, а я тебя знаю. Ты ведь Алабама Ковальски?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Tychus00=Морпех и медик — это классика.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Undead00=Никогда не пробовала лечить мертвых, но для тебя сделаю исключение.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Неправильно это — сотрудничать с зергами.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroRespond00=Я о тебе позабочусь. Не волнуйся.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroRespond01=Эй, я в деле.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroRespond02=Я не подведу.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Давай разберемся после боя, солдат.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Ладно, проехали. Давай займемся делом.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Ладно, как скажешь.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=Какой ужасный ожог! Вот, приложи к пострадавшему месту и исчезни!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Мне больше нравится спасать людей.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_MedicLove00=Кто не любит доктора?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Кто-нибудь говорит по-рыбьи? Или по-амфибьи?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=У нас все получится!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Protoss00=Я тоже не в восторге, инопланетянин.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=А ты все не угомонишься?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Tychus00=Я тебя прикрою. За дело!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Undead00=Мне придется лечить зомби. Самый странный день в жизни.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=Надеюсь, исцеляющий луч и на тебя подействует.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Жаль, мы вас тогда не добили.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Kill00=Время смерти: только что.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Kill01=Отключаю жизнеобеспечение.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Kill02=Пациент скорее мертв, чем жив.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Kill03=Нам понадобятся дополнительные мешки для трупов.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Kill04=Кто-нибудь, сообщите семье.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillKerrigan00=Вот и остановили заражение.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillMedic00=Ха-ха! Попробуй-ка залечить вот это!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillPandaren00=Поверить не могу, я только что убила панду.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillProtoss00=Хороший пришелец — мертвый пришелец.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillRaynor00=Он мертв... Джим.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillSpreeEnd00=С этой проблемой разобрались.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillTerran00=Нужно было выбирать другую сторону.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillWeird00=Кто-нибудь знает, что это было?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillWeird01=Эти герои все чудесатее и чудесатее.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillWeird02=Даже знать не хочу, кого мы сейчас убили. Продолжайте сражаться.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillWitchDoctor00=Получи, шарлатан!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/KillZerg00=Фу, у меня теперь все сапоги в слизи!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Laugh00=<small laugh>

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Laugh03=<laugh after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowLifeHeal00=Спасибо тебе за помощь.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowLifeHeal01=То, что доктор прописал.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ух, еле выжила. Ты молодец.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowMana00=У меня кончается мана.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowMana01=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/LowMana02=Мне нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/MatchEnd00=<Reuses a previous line of dialog. Do not record.>
VoiceOver/MedicBase/MatchEnd01=<Reuses a previous line of dialog. Do not record.>

VoiceOver/MedicBase/No00=Никак нет.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/No01=Ты же понимаешь, что это невозможно.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/No02=Хм. Нет.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Нужно помочь союзнику.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Я не справлюсь одна.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Эй, мне нужна помощь!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Атакуем цитадель!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Давайте захватим лагерь наемников.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Работаем по этому форту.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Давайте захватим эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Похоже, наш форт в опасности.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Защитите эту сторожевую башню, пока ее не захватил враг.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ping_KillHero00=Видите этого героя? Нужно его убрать.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed00=Записать на прием?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed01=Опишите характер недомогания.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed02=Я устроилась в ОЗД ради спокойного будущего для своих близких. Не думала, что в итоге попаду сюда.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed03=Как же я скучаю по Земле... Даже по букашкам... Там они были куда мельче...
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed04=О нет, это та самая игра «щелкни по мне, а я расскажу шутку»? Так, думай, думай... Черт! Я доктор, а не комик!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed05=Вообще-то лечение — дело нехитрое. То же самое, что убийство, только наоборот.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed06=Разумеется, все хотят убить медика. Именно поэтому я таскаю за собой этот огромный тяжеленный щит.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed07=Погоди, а разве стрелять в медика — не военное преступление? Или в Нексусе не действует Женевская конвенция?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed08=Поверь мне, после вкалывания молодому Сверхразуму нейростимуляторов я уже ничего не боюсь.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed09=Если будешь и дальше надоедать, то скоро узнаешь, что такое «нетрадиционная медицина».
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed10=Я и сама не переношу уколы, но ты не представляешь, как приятно всадить в кого-нибудь иглу.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed11=Всегда помни клятву Гиппократа: прежде всего, не навреди. Если это не работает, то используй гранаты.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed12=Морпехи — такие сплетники. Они всегда разносят слухи... Например, будто мы зашиваем раны при помощи степлеров. Вот болваны... Мы используем только гвозди! Скобы — слишком затратно.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed13=Мне определенно нравится новая экипировка... Погодите, а где тут оптическая вспышка? Гранатомет — конечно, неплохо, но хочется ослеплять противников.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed14=Ой, тут примечание! «Этот исцеляющий луч еще не прошел государственную сертификацию. После использования не рекомендуется управлять крупногабаритной техникой или сказочными существами».
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed15=«Возможны побочные эффекты: тошнота, пространственные перемещения, тяжесть в желудке и повышенная чувствительность. Перед использованием проконсультируйтесь с врачом».
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Pissed16=Хм, ладно, буду использовать его только на других.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Resurrected00=Ух ты, а я уже свет в конце тоннеля увидела.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Resurrected01=Спасибо, даже не знаю, чтоб я без тебя делала.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive00=Пульс ровный. Основные показатели стабильны.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive01=Доктора вызывали?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Revive02=Так, возвращаюсь на поле боя.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec00=Улучшение завершено.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec01=Новые инструменты! Как раз вовремя.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec02=Думаю, мне это пригодится.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec03=Одобрено лучшими специалистами.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Spec04=Мне это нравится.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt00=Видишь? Я настроена серьезно.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt01=Думаете, у вас есть шансы? Ха-ха.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Taunt02=Я разбиралась с солдатами и покруче вас.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/TeamKilled00=Соберитесь и давайте снова в бой.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_ExLocked00=Опишите характер недомогания.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Рада видеть тебя снова, командир.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Gift00=Я там, где нужна моя помощь.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Lockin00=Спасать жизни — наша работа.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Purchase00=Спасать жизни — наша работа.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_Trial00=Пройти тест? Да без проблем.

VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Готова оказать помощь, командир.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Я всегда готова.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ты не представляешь, насколько этот щит тяжелый. Может, приступим к делу?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ежеминутно умирает больше сотни людей. Не стоит терять времени.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used00=Наностимулятор готов.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used01=Сейчас станет лучше.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used02=Получай, солдат.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used03=Ввожу стимулятор.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate1Used04=Стимулятор в действии.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used00=Залезай или останешься тут!
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used01=Транспорт прибыл. Кого подвезти?
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Ultimate2Used02=Медэвак на месте. Все на борт!

VoiceOver/MedicBase/Yes04=Выдвигаемся немедленно.
VoiceOver/MedicBase/Yes05=Полагаю, дело срочное.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroAgree00=Иначе не может быть.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroAgree01=На то воля богов.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroAgree02=(утвердительно) М-м.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroBoast00=Если на то воля богов, у врага нет и шанса!

VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Умирать у нас ты мастер.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Твоя речь – как журчание реки. Чудесно.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Я не стану тратить на тебя время.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowMana00=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowMana01=Мне нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/LowMana02=Не хватает маны.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_KillHero00=Этому герою суждено умереть.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed00=Куда ведет тебя твой путь?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed01=Я служу Патриархам Ивгорода, избранным тысячей и одним богом.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed02=Я никогда бы не поверил, что мой путь приведет меня сюда. Но это произошло.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed03=Всегда обдумывай свои действия. И тогда ты будешь поступать мудро... Я надеюсь.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed04=Я побывал во многих краях и видел многих людей. И везде мудрость – редкий самоцвет, покоящийся на пике горы.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed05=Мне приходилось путешествовать вместе с честным воином, который верил только лживым словам, богиней, не доверявшей своим же собратьям, и мудрым древним созданием, из чьих уст лилась лишь глупость.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed06=Свой первый вдох я сделал под знаком бога солнца Итара. Я ношу его облачения и слышу его голос, указывающий мне путь.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed07=Я рад, что не родился под знаком меньшего божества. Есть боги безделья и неопрятности, и многие служат им. Порой, слишком рьяно.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed08=У меня есть свои волосы, если тебе так интересно. Просто я брею их, чтя свой обет.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed09=За всю жизнь я разбил кулаками множество досок, много постился... Но мучительнее всего было наносить татуировки на лицо...
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed10=Мое сердце исполнено преданности. Мой дух чист. Мои мантры... не противоречивы.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed11=Используя технику Взрывного касания, помни об одном... Взрываться должен твой враг, а не то, чем ты его касаешься.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed12=Опустоши свой разум. Будь аморфным, бесформенным, как огонь. Ты помещаешь огонь в чашу – он сжигает чашу, стол, вообще весь дом. Будь огнем, друг мой. Но не чашей.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed13=А ты, значит, служишь Мыширу, богу бесконечного щелканья по людям. Он, должно быть, сильно гордится тобой.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed14=Хочешь произвести на меня впечатление? Победи Шэньлуна. Но он уже давно мертв, так что... удачи.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed15=Мои удары быстры, как вспышка молнии... Это даже меня немного пугает.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected00=Твои поступки угодны богам, друг.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected01=Друг мой, наше дело еще не окончено.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive00=Боги хотят, чтобы я продолжил свой путь.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive01=Мое время еще не пришло.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive02=Я вновь готов служить.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec00=Я становлюсь сильнее.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec01=Я все яснее вижу свой путь.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec02=Боги ко мне благосклонны.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec03=Итар поднял меня на новые высоты.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec04=Я стал мудрее.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt00=Ты ищешь смерти?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt01=Я принесу тебе смерть.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt02=Твоя слабость противна богам.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/TeamKilled00=Это лишь испытание. И мы пройдем его.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExLocked00=Я – крушащая длань богов.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Я сохраню баланс.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Gift00=Похоже, я нужен где-то еще.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Lockin00=Итар, направь мою руку.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Purchase00=Боги наградили тебя мудростью.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial00=Испытание? Великолепно.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial01=О, позволь показать тебе пару приемов.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Те, кто не делает ничего, сами становятся ничем.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Время не стоит на месте. И я не должен!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Кто не рискует, тот не побеждает.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Богам неугодно безделье.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used00=Мой кулак направляют боги!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used01=Итар разгневан!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate2Used00=Тысяча и одно благословение.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate2Used01=Боги даруют тебе силу.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/WorthIt01=Баланс не пострадал.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes00=Я иду.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes01=Да.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes02=Во славу Ивгорода.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes03=Испытай меня.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes05=Я рад новым испытаниям.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Yes06=Мой разум чист.

VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed02=Беру мечи по 300.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed03=Что? Да не умирал я! Просто решил немного отдохнуть.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed04=Не самая умная мысль — без конца теребить воина. А если я тебе дам сдачи?
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed05=Знаешь, что такое амнезия? Сейчас объясню! Это как... м-м... это... забыл.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed06=Не одолжишь пару золотых? А то я как-то поиздержался. А? Что? Записываешь, что ли?
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed07=Никогда не тряси дворфа. Никогда! <Пауза> На дворфа надо орать. Тогда поймет.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed08=Эх, в горле пересохло. Погоди-ка... <слышно, как дворф что-то выжимает, затем звук льющейся жидкости> Ха! Я всегда знал, что борода мне пригодится!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed09=Можно забрать короля из гор, но нельзя отобрать горы у короля.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed10=По голове себе постучи!
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed11=Ходят слухи, что борода у моего деда была серебряная. Но он всю жизнь ее красил! Т-с-с.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed12=О нет, близзы укокошили твоего любимого персонажа? Да ладно, не переживай... Через пару дополнений увидишь его снова. Верь мне, уж я-то знаю, о чем говорю.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed13=Да, конечно, это трагедия и все такое... Но все же — какая отличная статуя вышла из моего брата Магни! Блестит, переливается, все дела...
VoiceOver/Muradin/Pissed14=Когда Бранн был маленьким, мы часто его ловили за просмотром журнала Лиги исследователей... Ха! (насмешливо) Он утверждал, что читает статьи, но мы-то знали, что все дело в картинках с клыкаррскими женщинами. <Смеется>

VoiceOver/Muradin/Resurrected01=Как-то быстро ситуация вышла из-под контроля.

VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_WaitLocked01=Эй, почему бы тебе не нажать на кнопку «Попробовать»? Вон там, внизу. Ты не пожалеешь!
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_WaitPurchased00=Слушай, я, конечно, понимаю, что я красавец и на меня можно смотреть бесконечно, но, может, уже займемся делом?
VoiceOver/Muradin/UI_WaitPurchased01=Предпочитаю действовать. А не стоять просто так.
VoiceOver/Muradin/Ultimate1Used00=Каз Модан!

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Мясник... Рад, что ты на нашей стороне.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Ты из Санктуария... Быть может, ты в курсе, почему мой том городского портала перестал работать?

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond00=Смерть – мой давний друг.

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond02=Да, я такой.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Насмехаешься над жрецом Ратмы? Очень глупо.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=О, да... Это объясняет твое присутствие. Хорошо.

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Давно ли? Разве что для тебя...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Хм-м... Нефалем... Выходит, легенды не лгут. Как занимательно.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Я никогда не якшался с демонами. Не желаю и впредь.

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=Пойдем же... Смерть ждет новых жертв.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Ах... Детский лепет.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=У меня просто мороз по коже.

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillArthas00=Мальчишка, примеривший личину бога смерти.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillAzmodan00=Пфф. Дуриэль – и тот был сильнее... А ведь он был просто-напросто гигантской личинкой.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillD3Hero00=А ведь я даже не нефалем.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDeath00=Еще одним «владыкой смерти» в Нексусе стало меньше.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDemon00=Баланс будет сохранен, демон.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDiablo00=Владыка Диабло, я одолел тебя!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillLeoric00=Мне нет толку от мертвецов, не желающих подчиняться.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillMephisto00=Счастливого пути, Мефисто. Передавай привет Бездне.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Вся мощь смерти к моим услугам.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillTyrael00=Прости меня, ангел. Но нарушители Баланса должны умереть.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillUndead00=Пустая трата мертвой плоти.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillWitchDoctor00=Колдун... Мертвых следует воскрешать как слуг, а не поклоняться им.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillZeratul00=Да... Косы и правда хороши.

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal01=Я на миг ощутил ледяную хватку смерти.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal02=Чудесная работа, лекарь. Чудесная...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana00=Мне не хватает... маны.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana01=Недостаточно маны.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana02=Мне бы хоть одно зелье маны.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No00=Ха. Нет.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No01=Я не могу.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No02=Это невозможно.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No03=(вздыхает) С чего вдруг?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Наш союзник на грани гибели.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Мне нужна помощь!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe01=На помощь!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Разрушьте цитадель врага!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Захватите этот лагерь наемников.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Снесите этот форт.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Хм-м... Эта сторожевая башня будет нам полезна.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Защищайте форт.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Не дайте им захватить сторожевую башню!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_KillHero00=Смерть заждалась этого героя.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed00=Чего тебе?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed01=Так ли нужно меня беспокоить?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed02=Хм? Ох, да. Коса и мне в новинку. Но, признаться, я уже оценил ее преимущества.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed03=В жизни неизбежны лишь две вещи... Смерть и... Хм-м. Вторую забыл... Ладно, пусть это тоже будет смерть, почему бы и нет.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed04=Ох, ох... Смерть тебе к лицу...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed05=Мы, жрецы Ратмы, призваны защищать Баланс. Но многие, похоже, не понимают, что это на самом деле значит.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed06=Воспринимай Баланс как страховочную сеть... которая без твоего ведома спасает твою рыхлую, розовощекую никчемность от небытия. Мой долг – беречь эту... сеть. Так что скажи спасибо.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed07=Предводителя некромантов также зовут «Гласом смерти». Отгадай с трех попыток, о чем он больше всего любит поговорить...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed08=В былые времена никто и не верил в существование нефалемов... Но теперь... вот они, целых шесть! Мне кажется, многовато... не так ли?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed09=Считаешь эту игру сложной? Ха! Да здесь даже героического режима нет!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed10=Что посеешь, то и пожнешь... А я сею семена смерти.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed11=Да, я воскрешаю мертвых. Не самое приятное зрелище.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed12=Сколько можно повторять, некромант не романтизирует смерть! Иначе это – некро... ф... Знаешь, неважно.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed13=Настанет день, и мне придется найти применение всем собранным за годы ушам. Быть может, смастерю из них пояс.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed14=Кто это у нас тут «мертвецки устал»? Дайте-ка мне взглянуть...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed15=Поддерживать Баланс – тяжкий труд. С другой стороны, усилить ангелов тут, понерфить демонов там – и дело сделано.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected00=Я вернулся, но я не зомби. Научишь меня этому позже.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected01=Истинное воскрешение? Но это невозможно...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive00=Так вот она какая — смерть... Приятное ощущение.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive01=Великий Цикл Бытия начинается вновь.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive02=Похоже, у меня здесь остались незавершенные дела.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive03=Хм? И к телу бежать не нужно? Замечательно.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec00=Интересно...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec01=Это придаст мне... пикантности.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec02=Так и будет.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec03=Ума тебе не занимать...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec04=О, я тоже приметил этот вариант...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt00=У тебя... свидание со смертью.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt01=Боишься меня? Правильно боишься.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt02=Я чувствую в тебе... жизнь. Позволь тебя от нее избавить.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/TeamKilled00=Не дайте смерти одолеть вас. Примите ее и свершите возмездие.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExLocked00=Мне подвластна смерть.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExPurchased00=О... Знакомое лицо.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Gift00=Щедрости тебе не занимать.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Lockin00=Время пришло.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Purchase00=Я снова в гуще событий.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial00=Вот это уже интереснее.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial01=Предлагаешь немного попрактиковаться?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Быть может, продолжим знакомство?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Давай же, испытай меня... Я жажду вернуться на поле битвы.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Брр... Надо было потеплее одеться...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Хм-м. Battle.net теперь выглядит куда привлекательнее.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used00=Волна яда!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used01=Ядовитая порча!

VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed03=Йо-хо-хо.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed04=Никогда не искал неприятностей, зато они за мной толпой ходят. По барам.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed05=Забавно... я уже давно не шериф, а до сих пор чувствую себя так, будто за каждым моим действием наблюдает магистрат.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed06=Есть в девушках с дредами какая-то изюминка...
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed07=Порой ощущаю себя персонажем какой-то игры.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed08=Скукотища. Давайте что-нибудь пустим на воздух?
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed09=Если в жизни твоей... черная полоса, делай «опа»! Или вызови «Гиперион» и разнеси все к чертям.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed10=<перекатывая лед в стакане> Эй, меня обслуживать сегодня будут?
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed11=Если играть в StarCraft задом наперед, получается, что я пересаживаюсь с крейсера на «Стервятник», у меня снова есть девушка, протоссы плевать хотели на мою планету, и вообще все клево.
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed12=Эх, музыкальный автомат бы сюда...
VoiceOver/Raynor/Pissed13=Служили два товарища, ага... Служили два товарища, ага...

VoiceOver/Raynor/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ну, как дела у моего любимого рейдера?

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed10=Нельзя одновременно отбиваться от псов Альянса в Оплоте Громоборцев и от собственного голода. Поэтому я начинаю каждый свой день с большой миски «Мясняшек»! «Мясняшки» – завтрак чемпионов... Орды.

VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed13=И кстати. Каждый раз, когда ты с треском проигрываешь охотнику... Знай, это я.
VoiceOver/RexxarBase/Pissed14=<SFX: Hearthstone victory music plays.> Все, хватит рассиживаться. На чем мы остановились? А, да. Нексус, все дела.

VoiceOver/SiegeTankDoom/Pissed08=А я ведь даже не знаю, где тут люк. Он же есть, правда? Я смогу отсюда выбраться?
VoiceOver/SiegeTankDoom/Pissed09=Вижу цель — не вижу препятствий.
VoiceOver/SiegeTankDoom/Pissed10=<звук сирены> Отставить отбой! Продолжаем распространять справедливость!
VoiceOver/SiegeTankDoom/Pissed11=Зачем ходить на свидания, если есть танк! <Звук поцелуя>
VoiceOver/SiegeTankDoom/Pissed12=Два наряда вне очереди!
VoiceOver/SiegeTankDoom/Pissed13=Если тебе в ухо фонариком посветить, глаза зажгутся?
VoiceOver/SiegeTankDoom/Pissed14=Сержант — и вдруг не мужчина? Ха, смирись с этим!

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ping_TurnIn01=We must turn these in.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed00=We are the Forsaken.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed01=My will is my own.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed02=Fast is fine, but accurate is final.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed03=You have no idea how tough it is to do this in heels.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed04=I have no time for games.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed05=Being undead isn’t all bad. You get to eat whatever or whoever you want and not gain a pound. Although keeping your jaw from falling off, does take some practice... And a little string.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed06=Night elf? I don't know what you're talking about.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed07=<Handheld Game Noises> Okay, maybe I've got SOME time for games.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed08=Time flies like an arrow. Flesh flies like carrion.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed09=<sings> Shoot that poison arrow through my heart...
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed10=What are we, if not slaves to this torment?
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed11=I'm no different from any other girl... I still dream of a Death Knight in shining armor who rides up on a Phantom steed and sweeps me off my feet with the blade of his evil sword! Turns me undead, and... Oh right... that's my nightmare.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed12=And let me tell you, torment is a very picky master. "Fold the towels like this, set the table like that..."
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed13=No I was never in Night Ranger... but I have an all-dead girl group called band-she.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed14=Just keep poking me and see what happens, savage.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed_Evo00=We are... Forsaken.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Pissed_Evo01=My will... my own.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Resurrected00=My undeath continues.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Resurrected01=I've returned.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeEnd00=Hardly worth the effort.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeEnd01=Cur.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeEnd02=You underestimate me, cretin.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeStart00=I'll never stop hunting you.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeStart01=I have plans for you, dog!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/RevengeStart02=You dare attack the Banshee Queen?
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Revive00=What joy is there in this curse?
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Revive01=Death cannot hold me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Revive02=Undead. Again.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Dance00=I dance to express my frustration with your command decisions.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Dance01=I am not a pawn to dance for your amusement.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Goodbye00=I take my leave.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Goodbye01=Farewell.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Hello00=You address the Banshee Queen.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Hello01=Greetings.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Sorry00=My apologies.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Sorry01=So sorry.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Thanks00=Many thanks.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_Thanks01=You have my thanks.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_WellPlayed00=Very clever of you.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Social_WellPlayed01=I couldn't have done it better.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec00=That will serve me well.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec01=Interesting.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec02=A wise selection.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec03=Good.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Spec04=Our victory is assured.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt03=Your presence offends me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt04=You will die first.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt05=I will spare no one.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt_Evo00=You... offend.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt_Evo01=You die.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Taunt_Evo02=Sapre... no one.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/TeamKilled00=Do not fear, I have been through worse.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_ExLocked00=My only interest is vengeance.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_ExPurchased00=Our enemies will beg for death's release.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Gift00=How... noble.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Lockin00=Our foes may as well surrender now.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Purchase00=Your enemies are mine.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Trial00=A test then? So be it.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_Trial01=You will not be disappointed.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitLocked00=Do it.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitLocked01=Unleash me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitPurchased00=I am not accustomed to waiting.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/UI_WaitPurchased01=Do not toy with me.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate1Used00=Fly, banshee. Your queen commands you!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Fly... queen commands...
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate2Used00=Lights out!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Ultimate2Used01=Pay with your blood!

VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes00=Let's move out.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes01=We shall be victorious!
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes02=I will do so.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes03=Spare no one.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes04=They won't know what hit them.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes05=Yes.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes06=It will be done.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes07=Slaughter them all.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes08=So be it.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo00=Move... out.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo01=We victorious.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo02=I do so.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo03=Slaughter all.
VoiceOver/Sylvanas/Yes_Evo04=So... it.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Attack00=Это наш шанс. В атаку!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Attack01=Уничтожим наших врагов!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Attack02=Атакуйте врага, пока он слаб.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Caution00=Осторожно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_GoodJob00=А у тебя... талант.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_GoodJob01=Они это заслужили.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_GoodJob02=Как мило.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Heal00=Исцели себя. Немедленно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Heal01=Твои раны ослабляют тебя. Исцелись.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Retreat00=Я должна отступить.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Retreat01=Отходим!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Uhoh00=Мы уступаем в этой битве.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Uhoh01=Они идут на прорыв!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/AI_Uhoh02=Ряды Отрекшихся ждет пополнение...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack00=Близится мое возмездие...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack01=Не знайте пощады.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack02=Вперед, в бой!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack03=Я вступаю в бой.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack04=Не щадить никого.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack05=Мы будем биться насмерть!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack06=Моли, чтобы я пощадила твою никчемную жизнь!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Celebrate00=Их укрепления рушатся.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Celebrate01=Они не устояли перед нами!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Comeback00=Они зашли так далеко, лишь чтобы пасть пред нами.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Death00=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Death01=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Death02=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Death03=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Death04=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Death05=<Death Exertion>
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Healed00=Неплохо, лекарь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Healed01=Прими мою благодарность.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Healed02=Я снова в порядке.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroAgree00=Меньшего я не ждала.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroAgree01=Несомненно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroAgree02=Пусть враги познают наш гнев.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroBoast00=Мы убьем всех, кто встанет у нас на пути.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroBoast01=Они заплатят за это кровью.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion00=Жаждешь увидеть, как падут наши враги?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion01=Тебе бы лучше приготовиться к бою.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_BloodElf00=Сину а'маноре.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Forsaken00=Темной Госпоже нужна твоя помощь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Как низко пали великие герои.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_GennGreymane00=Похоже, твой народ все-таки лишился предводителя.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Kaelthas00=Так-так, уж не наш ли это маленький принц?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Я вижу, как вы пялитесь на меня.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Из тебя получится отличный мур'далак, не так ли?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Я думала, глупцов в моей жизни было уже достаточно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=А ты можешь пригодиться в этой битве.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroRespond00=Ничто меня не остановит.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroRespond01=Не стоит недооценивать меня.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroRespond02=Наших врагов ждет страдание.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_BloodElf00=Покажи им силу Кель'Таласа!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Bore00=<DO NOT RECORD. REUSES REVENGE01>
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Forsaken00=Ты будешь служить мне.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Я бы тебя убила, но твое унижение доставит мне больше удовольствия.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_GennGreymane00=Ты умрешь в муках, как и твой сын.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Kaelthas00=Ха! Я хотя бы взошла на трон!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=Нет! Меньше пейте перед боем.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ты, должно быть, шутишь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Придержи язык, если не хочешь его лишиться.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_No00=<DO NOT RECORD. REUSES NO SOUND>
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Это будет... взаимовыгодное сотрудничество.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Kill00=Кара за предательство – смерть!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Kill01=Ты вызываешь у меня отвращение.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Kill02=Во славу Отрекшихся!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Kill03=Меня утомила твоя наглость!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Kill04=Баш'а но фалор тала!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillArthas00=Передавай привет вечной Тьме.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillBloodElf00=Шорель'аран, синдорай.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillGarrosh00=На сей раз дракон тебя не спасет, Гаррош.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillKaelthas00=Ты слаб, как и твой отец...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillKerrigan00=Здесь может быть лишь одна королева. Ты – жалкая пешка.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillSkeletonKing00=Нежить служит только мне!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Я никогда не остановлюсь... Никогда.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillStitches00=Никто из Плети не избежит моего гнева!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/KillThrall00=Это тебе за то, что отдал Орду Гаррошу!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Laugh00=<smirk>

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Laugh10=<dark, subdued laughter>
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal00=Я благодарю тебя.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal01=Я спасена!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowLifeHeal02=Ты хорошо справляешься, лекарь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana00=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana01=Нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/LowMana02=Для этого нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No00=Я так не думаю.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No01=<презрительно> Нет.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/No02=Не бывать этому.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Я полагаю, вам следует помочь союзнику.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Мне нужна помощь!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Ко мне, быстрее!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Атакуем самое уязвимое место – их цитадель.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Нам нужно... "завербовать" этих наемников.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Разрушьте этот форт до основания!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Захватите эту сторожевую башню!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Если нашу цитадель разрушат, мы проиграем. Защищайте ее!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Защищайте этот форт ценой своих жалких жизней!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Повелеваю, защищайте эту башню.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ping_KillHero00=Убейте этого... "героя"!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed00=Кто мы, как не рабы вечного страдания?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed01=Мы – Отрекшиеся.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed02=Сделаешь это еще раз – и щелкать будет уже нечем.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed03=Время летит, как стрела. Черная, отравленная стрела.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed04=Скорость важна. Но точку в споре ставит меткость.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed05=Ты и представить не можешь, как тяжело бегать и сражаться на каблуках. Хорошо хоть мои нервные окончания уже давно сгнили.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed06=У меня нет времени на игры. Но появляюсь я только в них... Хм...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed07=Все знают, что лучшие вечеринки на Тыквовин – только в Подгороде.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed08=Гнев Короля-лича покажется тебе мелочью в сравнении с гневом Королевы-банши.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed09=Нет, я не буду ничего петь. Я безжалостная владычица нежити, а не музыкальная шкатулка.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed10=Убита жестоким тираном, возрождена в виде могучего, но ужасного создания, провозгласила себя королевой и посвятила свое существование возмездию... Я думала, что я одна такая, пока не встретила Керриган.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed11=Слушай, я была высшей эльфийкой, банши, потом стала высшей эльфийкой-нежитью. Но я никогда не была ночной эльфийкой. Я не пропадаю, стоя на месте.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed12=Нет, я не разрешала тауренам сочинять обо мне песни. Для этого у меня есть группа «Сильвана и банши».
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed13=Кто-нибудь еще слышит это жужжание?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed14=Позови меня с собой, я приду сквозь тьму и слезы, я отправлюсь за тобой... выслежу и уничтожу.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed15=Фу, откуда мертвечиной потянуло? А, все в порядке. Это я.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Response_CastingQ05=<замогильным шепотом> Тала!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Resurrected00=Тьма не поглотила меня... пока что.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Resurrected01=Дело рук моей валь'киры?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Revive00=Какая радость в этом проклятии?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Revive01=Мне неведом покой.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Revive02=У меня нет времени на игры.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec00=Сойдет.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec01=Интересно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec02=Хорошо.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec03=Прекрасно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec04=Победа близка.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt00=Я научу тебя хорошим манерам.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt01=Оскорбишь меня при жизни – и станешь служить мне после смерти.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt02=Я искала подходящую цель... и нашла тебя.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/TeamKilled00=Не бойтесь. В моей жизни были вещи и пострашнее смерти.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_ExLocked00=Будь на моей стороне или пади!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Темная Госпожа следит за тобой.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Gift00=Как... благородно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Lockin00=Отрекшиеся – победители!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Purchase00=Мудрый поступок.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Trial00=Не много ли испытаний выпало на мою долю?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Trial01=Ты играешь с силами, которые не можешь постичь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Так и будешь просто смотреть на меня?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Высвободи мой гнев!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Я не привыкла ждать.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Мое терпение на исходе.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate1Used00=Да не дрогнет моя рука.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate1Used01=Пора уравнять чаши весов!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used00=Ты в моей власти.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used01=Услышь зов Королевы-банши!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used02=Слушай и повинуйся.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used03=Твой разум так слаб.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used04=Идем, слуга.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used05=Служи Темной Госпоже!

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/WorthIt00=Моя смерть того стоила!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/WorthIt01=Месть – мое единственное утешение.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes00=В атаку!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes01=Я здесь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes02=Конечно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes03=Не испытывай мое терпение.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes04=Момент настал!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes05=Несомненно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes06=На то моя воля.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes07=Отдай приказ.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Yes08=Слушаю.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Attack00=Это наш шанс. В атаку!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Attack01=Уничтожим наших врагов!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Attack02=Атакуйте врага, пока он слаб.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Caution00=Осторожно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_GoodJob00=А у тебя... талант.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_GoodJob01=Они это заслужили.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_GoodJob02=Как мило.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Heal00=Исцели себя. Немедленно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Heal01=Твои раны ослабляют тебя. Исцелись.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Retreat00=Я должна отступить.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Retreat01=Отходим!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Uhoh00=Мы уступаем в этой битве.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Uhoh01=Они идут на прорыв!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/AI_Uhoh02=Ряды Отрекшихся ждет пополнение...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack00=Близится мое возмездие...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack01=Не знайте пощады.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack02=Вперед, в бой!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack03=Я вступаю в бой.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack04=Не щадить никого.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack05=Мы будем биться насмерть!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Attack06=Моли, чтобы я пощадила твою никчемную жизнь!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Celebrate00=Их укрепления рушатся.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Celebrate01=Они не устояли перед нами!

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Healed00=Неплохо, лекарь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Healed01=Прими мою благодарность.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Healed02=Я снова в порядке.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroAgree00=Меньшего я не ждала.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroAgree01=Несомненно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroAgree02=Пусть враги познают наш гнев.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroBoast00=Мы убьем всех, кто встанет у нас на пути.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroBoast01=Они заплатят за это кровью.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion00=Жаждешь увидеть, как падут наши враги?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion01=Тебе бы лучше приготовиться к бою.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_BloodElf00=Сину а'маноре.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Forsaken00=Темной Госпоже нужна твоя помощь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Как низко пали великие герои.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_GennGreymane00=Похоже, твой народ все-таки лишился предводителя.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Kaelthas00=Так-так, уж не наш ли это маленький принц?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Я вижу, как вы пялитесь на меня.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Из тебя получится отличный мур'далак, не так ли?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Я думала, глупцов в моей жизни было уже достаточно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Positive00=А ты можешь пригодиться в этой битве.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroRespond00=Ничто меня не остановит.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroRespond01=Не стоит недооценивать меня.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroRespond02=Наших врагов ждет страдание.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_BloodElf00=Покажи им силу Кель'Таласа!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Forsaken00=Ты будешь служить мне.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Я бы тебя убила, но твое унижение доставит мне больше удовольствия.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_GennGreymane00=Ты умрешь в муках, как и твой сын.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Kaelthas00=Ха! Я хотя бы взошла на трон!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=Нет! Меньше пейте перед боем.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ты, должно быть, шутишь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Negative00=Придержи язык, если не хочешь его лишиться.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_No00=На какой я был строчке?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Positive00=Это будет... взаимовыгодное сотрудничество.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill00=Кара за предательство – смерть!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill01=Ты вызываешь у меня отвращение.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill02=Во славу Отрекшихся!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill03=Меня утомила твоя наглость!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill04=Баш'а но фалор тала!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillArthas00=Передавай привет вечной Тьме.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillBloodElf00=Шорель'аран, синдорай.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillKaelthas00=Ты слаб, как и твой отец...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillKerrigan00=Здесь может быть лишь одна королева. Ты – жалкая пешка.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillSkeletonKing00=Нежить служит только мне!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillSpreeEnd00=Я никогда не остановлюсь... Никогда.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillStitches00=Никто из Плети не избежит моего гнева!

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowLifeHeal01=Я спасена!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowLifeHeal02=Ты хорошо справляешься, лекарь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowMana00=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowMana01=Нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/LowMana02=Для этого нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/No00=Я так не думаю.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/No01=<презрительно> Нет.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/No02=Не бывать этому.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AssistHero00=Я полагаю, вам следует помочь союзнику.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AssistMe00=Мне нужна помощь!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AssistMe01=Ко мне, быстрее!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackCastle00=Атакуем самое уязвимое место – их цитадель.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackMerc00=Нам нужно... "завербовать" этих наемников.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Разрушьте этот форт до основания!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_AttackTower00=Захватите эту сторожевую башню!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendCastle00=Если нашу цитадель разрушат, мы проиграем. Защищайте ее!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Защищайте этот форт ценой своих жалких жизней!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendTower00=Повелеваю, защищайте эту башню.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_KillHero00=Убейте этого... "героя"!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed00=Кто мы, как не рабы вечного страдания?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed01=Мы – Отрекшиеся.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed02=Сделаешь это еще раз – и щелкать будет уже нечем.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed03=Время летит, как стрела. Черная, отравленная стрела.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed04=Скорость важна. Но точку в споре ставит меткость.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed05=Ты и представить не можешь, как тяжело бегать и сражаться на каблуках. Хорошо хоть мои нервные окончания уже давно сгнили.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed06=У меня нет времени на игры. Но появляюсь я только в них... Хм...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed07=Все знают, что лучшие вечеринки на Тыквовин – только в Подгороде.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed08=Гнев Короля-лича покажется тебе мелочью в сравнении с гневом Королевы-банши.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed09=Нет, я не буду ничего петь. Я безжалостная владычица нежити, а не музыкальная шкатулка.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed10=Убита жестоким тираном, возрождена в виде могучего, но ужасного создания, провозгласила себя королевой и посвятила свое существование возмездию... Я думала, что я одна такая, пока не встретила Керриган.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed11=Слушай, я была высшей эльфийкой, банши, потом стала высшей эльфийкой-нежитью. Но я никогда не была ночной эльфийкой. Я не пропадаю, стоя на месте.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed12=Нет, я не разрешала тауренам сочинять обо мне песни. Для этого у меня есть группа «Сильвана и банши».
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed13=Кто-нибудь еще слышит это жужжание?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed14=Позови меня с собой, я приду сквозь тьму и слезы, я отправлюсь за тобой... выслежу и уничтожу.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed15=Фу, откуда мертвечиной потянуло? А, все в порядке. Это я.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Resurrected01=Дело рук моей валь'киры?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Revive00=Какая радость в этом проклятии?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Revive01=Мне неведом покой.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Revive02=У меня нет времени на игры.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec00=Сойдет.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec01=Интересно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec02=Хорошо.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec03=Прекрасно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec04=Победа близка.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt00=Я научу тебя хорошим манерам.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt01=Оскорбишь меня при жизни – и станешь служить мне после смерти.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt02=Я искала подходящую цель... и нашла тебя.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/TeamKilled00=Не бойтесь. В моей жизни были вещи и пострашнее смерти.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_ExLocked00=Будь на моей стороне или пади!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_ExPurchased00=Темная Госпожа следит за тобой.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Gift00=Как... благородно.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Lockin00=Отрекшиеся – победители!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Purchase00=Мудрый поступок.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Trial00=Не много ли испытаний выпало на мою долю?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Trial01=Ты играешь с силами, которые не можешь постичь.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitLocked00=Так и будешь просто смотреть на меня?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitLocked01=Высвободи мой гнев!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitPurchased00=Я не привыкла ждать.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitPurchased01=Мое терпение на исходе.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate1Used00=Да не дрогнет моя рука.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate1Used01=Пора уравнять чаши весов!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used00=Ты в моей власти.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used01=Услышь зов Королевы-банши!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used02=Слушай и повинуйся.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used03=Твой разум так слаб.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used04=Идем, слуга.

VoiceOver/Tassadar/IntroResponse_Murky00=Позабудь о своей ненависти, дитя. Возмездие — неверный путь.
VoiceOver/Tassadar/IntroResponse_Negative00=Сконцентрируйся на битве, и, возможно, она закончится быстрее для нас обоих.

VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ping_KillHero00=Этот враг должен пасть.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed00=Да, вершитель?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed01=Я жду приказаний.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed02=У меня нет времени на игры... <Пауза> Ну хорошо, хорошо! Но только один матч.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed03=И кто-то там говорил, что это у орков большие наплечники...
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed04=Холод смерти мне неведом... Я слишком тепло одет.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed05=Нам необходимо подкрепление! Вершитель, бросай в бой риверов!
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed06=Что? Что значит — риверов больше нет? Тогда вызывай драгунов!
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed07=<вздох> Ну, и что ты предлагаешь? <гневно> Какой еще Излучатель Пустоты?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed08=Со времен первого StarCraft видеоигры так продвинулись... Я уже почти не различаю пиксели.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed09=С темными поведешься, к светлым не вернешься.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed10=Я все чаще думаю: пожалуй, Мар Сару все-таки следовало очистить.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed11=Эн таро... хм... Тассадар.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed12=Позвони мне, позвони... Позвони мне ради Кхалы...
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed13=Несмотря на всякие домыслы, псионика — это не какая-то «космическая магия». Между ними нет ничего общего.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Pissed14=Не стоит недооценивать волю тамплиера. Она сильнее, чем обычно думают.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Resurrected00=Я вернулся.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Resurrected01=Я ценю твою помощь.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Revive00=Кхала вечна.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Revive01=Кхала-дор-а.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Revive02=Свет справедливости засиял вновь.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec00=Так было предначертано.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec01=Ключевое решение.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec02=За'тун калинар.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec03=Я согласен.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Spec04=Я не сомневался.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Taunt00=Враги Перворожденных падут.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Taunt01=Как ты смеешь становиться у меня на пути?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Taunt02=Склонись пред сиянием Кхалы.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/TeamKilled00=Пожалуй, мне осталось только сесть и помедитировать.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_ExLocked00=Приветствую, незнакомец.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_ExPurchased00=Здравствуй, вершитель.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_Gift00=Я отправлюсь туда, где во мне нуждаются.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_Lockin00=Порядок рождает справедливость.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_Purchase00=Близится наш час.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_Trial00=Всякое великое деяние начинается с малого.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_Trial01=Через испытания мы достигаем совершенства.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_WaitLocked00=Я готов.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_WaitLocked01=Мы теряем время.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_WaitPurchased00=Моя медитация завершена. <удивленно> О, ты еще здесь?
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/UI_WaitPurchased01=Высшие тамплиеры привыкли на всех смотреть свысока.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ultimate1Used00=Барьер создан!
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ultimate1Used01=Силовой заслон!
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ultimate1Used02=Турас.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ultimate1Used03=Стоять.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ultimate1Used_Evo01=Силовой заслон.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ultimate1Used_Evo02=Турас.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ultimate1Used_Evo03=Стоять.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Ultimate2Used00=Пустота и Кхала слились в одно!

VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/WorthIt00=Оправданная жертва.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/WorthIt01=Быть по сему.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Yes00=Да будет так.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Yes01=Тара кал-а!
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Yes02=Сила в единстве.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Yes03=Не теряй бдительности.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Yes04=Эн таро Адун.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Yes05=Конечно.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Yes06=Твоя воля исполнится.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Yes07=Да свершится предначертанное.
VoiceOver/TassadarCryptlord/Yes08=За Айур.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Attack00=Атакуем! Лок'тар!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Attack01=Усилить натиск! Убейте их всех!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Attack02=Уничтожим их!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Caution00=Осторожнее. Духи неспокойны.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_GoodJob00=Точный удар.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_GoodJob01=Отличный бой!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_GoodJob02=Ха, было весело.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Heal00=Иди, подлечись. Восстанови силы.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Heal01=Беги к исцеляющему фонтану. Это приказ.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Retreat00=Мне нужно исцеление....
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Retreat01=Я вернусь как можно скорее.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Uhoh00=Нет!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Uhoh01=Проклятье!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/AI_Uhoh02=Прискорбно.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Attack00=Лок-нарош!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Attack01=Наконец-то...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Attack02=За Молот Рока!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Attack03=Твое время вышло!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Attack04=Узри всю мощь Орды!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Attack05=Я был вынужден это сделать!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Attack06=Кровь и гром!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Celebrate00=Отлично!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Celebrate01=Продолжайте сражаться, воины!

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Healed00=Спасибо, лекарь!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Healed01=Ха-ха-ха! Вот, так-то лучше.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Healed02=Отличное исцеление.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroAgree00=Они познают ярость Орды!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroAgree01=Пусть духи направляют нас.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroAgree02=Я согласен с тобой!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroBoast00=Лок'тар огар! Победа или смерть!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroBoast01=Никто не встанет у нас на пути!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion00=Вы готовы, воины?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion01=Война скоро начнется. Надеюсь, все готовы...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Falstad00=Готов увидеть всю мощь Молота Рока, дворф?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Гаррош...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Hearthstone00=<Reuses Attack03 - For Doomhammer!>
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Horde00=В бой, мои воины! Им не остановить Орду!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Давно не виделись, Джайна...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Мурлок? Ты-то что здесь делаешь?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Значит, они прислали тебя...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Здравствуй!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Rehgar00=Здравствуй, брат-шаман.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Rexxar00=Приветствую тебя, герой Орды!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Вариан... надеюсь, твой буйный нрав не станет помехой.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroRespond00=Конечно.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroRespond01=Без вопросов.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroRespond02=Ха-ха-ха, и впрямь.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Agreement00=<Reuses Respond02>
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Falstad00=<вздыхает> Я уже в сотый раз слышу от тебя эту историю...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=Хорошо, что я – могущественный шаман.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=Это честь для меня. Лок'тар огар, воин!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Так и есть, Джайна.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Интересно, что он хотел сказать...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Скоро начнется битва. Надеюсь, на поле боя ты будешь не только языком трепать.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Сразимся во славу Орды!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Rehgar00=Официальность тебе не к лицу, Регар.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Rexxar00=Идем, герой. Пора выиграть эту битву.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Легко сказать, нелегко доказать.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill00=Твой жизненный путь закончился здесь!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill01=Пади перед Ордой.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill02=Земля примет тебя!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill03=Твоя война окончена.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Kill04=Пф. Туда тебе и дорога.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillArthas00=Конец твоему правлению.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillDeathwing00=Пусть земля примет твою оскверненную душу, Нелтарион.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillDemon00=Орда не склонится перед демоном.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillETC00=Передай Матери-Земле мои наилучшие пожелания.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillGarrosh00=Ты вновь разочаровал меня, Гаррош.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillHorde00=Да упокоится твой дух с миром, воин.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillJaina00=Прощай, Джайна.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Хе-хе-хе. Я ожидал большего.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/KillVarian00=Я ожидал большего от великого Ло'гоша.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>

VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal00=Твой вождь благодарит тебя.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ты успел вовремя, лекарь.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowLifeHeal02=Мой дух восполнен.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana00=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana01=Нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/LowMana02=Мне не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No00=Невозможно.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No01=Хм... Нет.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/No02=Не трать мое время.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Союзнику нужна помощь.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistMe00=На помощь, быстрее!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Мне нужно подкрепление!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Уничтожьте их цитадель! Лок'тар!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Нам надо заручиться поддержкой этих наемников.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Воины, атакуйте их форт!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Нам нужно захватить эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Мы должны немедленно защитить наш форт.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Воины, защищайте эту сторожевую башню!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ping_KillHero00=Убейте этого героя, немедленно!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed00=Я — вождь!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed01=Духи неспокойны.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed02=Хмм? Да, точно... Мы тут шутки шутим. Прости, давно подобным не занимался.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed03=Эх... Как же я скучаю по стратегиям в реальном времени!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed04=Изометрия, эпичные масштабные битвы...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed05=Хотя по этому щелканью по мне я точно не скучаю...
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed06=Земля, ветер и огонь, даруйте хорошую погоду. Мы идем на пляж!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed07=Ты выбираешь вождя, вождь выбирает войну.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed08=Я большой, зеленый, и я крушу!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed09=Совет от вождя... Не стоит бросаться делать глупости только потому, что кто-то прокричал "За Орду!"
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed10=Как думаешь, предок Оргрима назвал свой род в честь Молота Рока, или молот был назван в честь его владельца?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed11=Хм... Посмотрим, чем меня снабдили на этот раз... Цепная молния... всегда хороша. Дух дикого зверя... Неистовство ветра... Ха, прости, Регар, похоже, все лучшее досталось мне.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed12=После пары дополнений к этой игре меня заменят Гаррошем.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed13=Удар, сразивший Оргрима, оставил отметину изнутри его нагрудной пластины. Всегда напоминает о том, что враг может атаковать там, где ты его меньше всего ожидаешь.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Pissed14=Прости, что? Что значит "в этой игре есть сюжет"? Кому-то заплатили за историю о том, как Рейнор встретил Диабло? Это разве не тема для фанфиков? <Вздох> Я на такое не подписывался.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Resurrected00=Спасибо тебе.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Resurrected01=Хорошо, что ты рядом.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive00=Орду не убить.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive01=Лок'тар огар!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Revive02=Да благословят меня предки.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec00=Хм. Отличный выбор.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec01=Хм. То, что надо.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec02=Сила наполняет меня.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec03=Духи мне улыбаются.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Spec04=Да! Я чувствую, как стал сильнее.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt00=Стихии уничтожат тебя.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt01=Я воплощаю ярость Орды!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Taunt02=Сразись с сыном Дуротана!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/TeamKilled00=Наш дух так легко не сломить!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_ExLocked00=Лок'тар.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Чего ты хочешь?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Gift00=Твой союзник — мой друг.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Lockin00=Во славу Орды!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Purchase00=За Орду!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Trial00=Давай, я покажу тебе, как это делается.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_Trial01=Смотри внимательно. Второй раз повторять не буду.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Позволь показать тебе истинную силу стихий.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Нельзя медлить. Нам надо выиграть эту войну.
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ну и что ты там делаешь?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Нам не пора на войну?
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used00=Познай ярость Молота Рока!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used01=Хватит!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used02=Против тебя — вся мощь стихий!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate1Used03=Вам конец!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used00=Земля, поглоти моих врагов!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used01=Дрожи от страха!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used02=Мой союзник — сама Земля!
VoiceOver/ThrallBase/Ultimate2Used03=Сила Орды!

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Horde00=Это честь для меня. Лок'тар огар, воин!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Так и есть, Джайна.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Murky00=Интересно, что он хотел сказать...
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/IntroResponse_Negative00=Скоро начнется битва. Надеюсь, на поле боя ты будешь не только языком трепать.

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed01=Духи неспокойны.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed02=Хмм? Да, точно... Мы тут шутки шутим. Прости, давно подобным не занимался.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed03=Эх... Как же я скучаю по стратегиям в реальном времени!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed04=Изометрия, эпичные масштабные битвы...
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed05=Хотя по этому щелканью по мне я точно не скучаю...

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed07=Ты выбираешь вождя, вождь выбирает войну.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed08=Я большой, зеленый, и я крушу!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed09=Совет от вождя... Не стоит бросаться делать глупости только потому, что кто-то прокричал "За Орду!"
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed10=Как думаешь, предок Оргрима назвал свой род в честь Молота Рока, или молот был назван в честь его владельца?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed11=Хм... Посмотрим, чем меня снабдили на этот раз... Цепная молния... всегда хороша. Дух дикого зверя... Неистовство ветра... Ха, прости, Регар, похоже, все лучшее досталось мне.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed12=После пары дополнений к этой игре меня заменят Гаррошем.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed13=Удар, сразивший Оргрима, оставил отметину изнутри его нагрудной пластины. Всегда напоминает о том, что враг может атаковать там, где ты его меньше всего ожидаешь.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed14=Прости, что? Что значит "в этой игре есть сюжет"? Кому-то заплатили за историю о том, как Рейнор встретил Диабло? Это разве не тема для фанфиков? <Вздох> Я на такое не подписывался.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Resurrected00=Спасибо тебе.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Resurrected01=Хорошо, что ты рядом.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/RevengeEnd00=Это все?

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_Trial00=Давай, я покажу тебе, как это делается.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_Trial01=Смотри внимательно. Второй раз повторять не буду.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitLocked00=Позволь показать тебе истинную силу стихий.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitLocked01=Нельзя медлить. Нам надо выиграть эту войну.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ну и что ты там делаешь?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/UI_WaitPurchased01=Нам не пора на войну?
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used00=Познай ярость Молота Рока!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used01=Хватит!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used02=Против тебя — вся мощь стихий!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate1Used03=Вам конец!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate2Used00=Земля, поглоти моих врагов!
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Ultimate2Used01=Дрожи от страха!

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Healed02=Отличное исцеление.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/IntroAgree00=Они познают ярость Орды!

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/LowLifeHeal02=Мой дух восполнен.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AssistMe00=На помощь, быстрее!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AssistMe01=Мне нужно подкрепление!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AttackCastle00=Уничтожьте их цитадель! Лок'тар!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AttackMerc00=Нам надо заручиться поддержкой этих наемников.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Воины, атакуйте их форт!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_AttackTower00=Нам нужно захватить эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed01=Духи неспокойны.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed02=Хмм? Да, точно... Мы тут шутки шутим. Прости, давно подобным не занимался.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed03=Эх... Как же я скучаю по стратегиям в реальном времени!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed04=Изометрия, эпичные масштабные битвы...
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed05=Хотя по этому щелканью по мне я точно не скучаю...
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed06=Земля, ветер и огонь, даруйте хорошую погоду. Мы идем на пляж!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed07=Ты выбираешь вождя, вождь выбирает войну.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed08=Я большой, зеленый, и я крушу!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed09=Совет от вождя... Не стоит бросаться делать глупости только потому, что кто-то прокричал "За Орду!"
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed10=Как думаешь, предок Оргрима назвал свой род в честь Молота Рока, или молот был назван в честь его владельца?
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed11=Хм. Посмотрим, чем меня снабдили на этот раз... Цепная молния... всегда хороша. Дух дикого зверя... Неистовство ветра... Ха, прости, Регар, похоже, все лучшее досталось мне.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed12=После пары дополнений к этой игре меня заменят Гаррошем.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed13=Удар, сразивший Оргрима, оставил отметину изнутри его нагрудной пластины. Всегда напоминает о том, что враг может атаковать там, где ты его меньше всего ожидаешь.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed14=Прости, что? Что значит "в этой игре есть сюжет"? Кому-то заплатили за историю о том, как Рейнор встретил Диабло? Это разве не тема для фанфиков? <Вздох> Я на такое не подписывался.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Resurrected00=Спасибо тебе.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Resurrected01=Хорошо, что ты рядом.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Revive00=Орду не убить.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Revive01=Лок'тар огар!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Revive02=Да благословят меня предки.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Spec00=Хм. Отличный выбор.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_WaitLocked00=Позволь показать тебе истинную силу стихий.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate1Used00=Познай ярость Молота Рока!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate1Used01=Хватит!

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate2Used01=Дрожи от страха!
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Ultimate2Used02=Мой союзник — сама Земля!

VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed01=Пожалуйста, уточните запрос.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed02=Социальный протокол запущен. Щелкните, чтобы продолжить.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed03=Расправь плечи и сокруши Небеса. Только мой шмот не трогай.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed04=Справедливость – это я.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed05=Да, крылья складываются, когда я использую ускорители. Всем известно, что мехе для полета не нужны крылья.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed06=Расплата уже близка. Статус загрузки: 3,14%. <пауза> Wi-Fi здесь отвратительный.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed07=Все государства стремятся к миру... И поэтому создают армии огромных роботов, вооруженных ракетами и лазерными мечами. До сих пор это не очень-то помогало. Но в этот раз все будет иначе!
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed08=Если Blizzard все же выпустит фигурку мехи Тассадара, я требую выпуск мехи Тираэля! И она должна быть ничуть не хуже!

VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed12=Некоторые мехи могут объединяться в могучие боевые машины. Но доступ к этой функции появляется только в последние две минуты боя. Явный конструкторский просчет.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed13=Психология роботов отличается от человеческой. Прежде всего, роботы глубоко порядочны.
VoiceOver/TyraelMecha/Pissed14=Внимание. Процессор юмора перегрелся. Ошибка в предыдущей шутке.

VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed11=О богиня, даруй мне меткость и проворство. Пусть мои стрелы бьют точно в цель и, если мне суждено предстать пред тобою сегодня, дозволь мне умереть, опустошив свой колчан.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed12=Ах, беззаботное детство... Как я скучаю по этой паре тысяч лет.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed13=Мы с Малфурионом сразу договорились — никаких смен облика. Я этими играми не увлекаюсь...
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Pissed14=Спят усталые зверушки, птички спят. Спит Элуна, и ее жрецы храпят. За день все устали очень, скажем всем «Спокойной ночи»...

VoiceOver/Tyrande/WorthIt01=Достойный обмен.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes00=Во имя Элуны.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes01=Да будет так.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes02=Немедленно.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes03=Как повелит богиня.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes04=Ану'дора!
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes05=Уже выполняю.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes06=Бегу.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes07=Я займусь этим.
VoiceOver/Tyrande/Yes08=Да, конечно.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Attack00=Нападаем! Враг слаб!
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Attack01=Все в наступление!
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Attack02=Мы должны нанести удар сейчас!
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Caution00=Будьте осторожнее.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_GoodJob00=Отличная работа.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_GoodJob01=Отличный бой.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_GoodJob02=Достойный удар.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Heal00=Твои дела плохи. Попробуй воспользоваться фонтаном.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Heal01=На твоем месте я бы уже направлялся к исцеляющему фонтану.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Retreat00=Я должен отступить.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Retreat01=Я отступаю. Но лишь на время.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh00=Как жаль.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh01=Вот тебе раз.
VoiceOver/Uther/AI_Uhoh02=Не отчаивайся.
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack00=За Лордерон!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack01=Ощути всю силу возмездия!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack02=Да падет на тебя проклятье Света!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack03=За Серебряную Длань!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack04=Берегитесь, враги Света!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack05=С нами Свет!
VoiceOver/Uther/Attack06=Я — молот справедливости!
VoiceOver/Uther/Celebrate00=Так их!
VoiceOver/Uther/Celebrate01=Не давать им спуску!
VoiceOver/Uther/Comeback00=Мы их нагоняем! Продолжайте, продолжайте!
VoiceOver/Uther/Death00=<Предсмертный возглас>
VoiceOver/Uther/Death01=<Предсмертный возглас>
VoiceOver/Uther/Death02=<Предсмертный возглас>
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed00=Да благословит Свет твою руку, целитель.
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed01=Благодарю.
VoiceOver/Uther/Healed02=Отличное исцеление!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree00=Я следую за тобой.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree01=Я слышу.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroAgree02=Вот это я понимаю!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroBoast00=Свет приведет нас к победе.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroBoast01=Мы будем сражаться с честью!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion00=Зададим им жару?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion01=Ну что, готовы?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Alliance00=Всегда рад биться плечом к плечу с верным воином Альянса.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Почему я должен верить тебе, мальчишка?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Я полагаю, ты и есть «крестоносец», о котором столько говорят.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Greymane00=Генн Седогрив собственной персоной! Гилнеасу давно пора вернуться в бой.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Ох. Орда... А день так хорошо начинался...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Impressed00=Хм, по виду ты не новичок на поле боя.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Jaina00=Леди Джайна, мне приятно снова сражаться плечом к плечу с вами.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Король-скелет, значит? Довольно очевидно, как по мне.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Light00=<Do not record. Reuses Pissed01>
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_LightVictory00=<Do not record. Reuses Boast00>
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Medic00=Ха! Приветствую тебя, коллега!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Так ты вообще кто такой?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Некромант, значит? Не скажу, что мне нравится ваше ремесло.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Negative00=<насмешливо> А, так это ты...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Здравствуй, друг! Ну что, нанесем врагу справедливость?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Stitches00=Во имя Света, что ты за поганище?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Сильвана? <beat> Выглядишь кошмарно.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Вариан, когда я тебя видел в последний раз, ты был еще неопытным юнцом.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Мне кажется, или вы, зерги, становитесь все страннее и страннее?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zuljin00=Так вот ты какой, могучий Зул'джин. Я ожидал большего.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond00=Всегда.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond01=С радостью.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond02=Во имя Света!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Слава Альянсу!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Angry00=Можешь не надеяться на лечение. Даже если будешь умирать!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Закрой свой рот, пока я не помог тебе это сделать.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Свет всемилостивый, а ты что такое?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Cranky00=В мое время старших уважали. ОСОБЕННО если от них зависела твоя жизнь.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Да брось. Я служил Свету, когда тебя и в планах не было.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Да, да, я понял. Ты упиваешься собственным остроумием. Может, займемся делом?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Excited00=Ха! Да об этом дне будут слагать легенды!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Greymane00=Ха, рад слышать, старый пес... <beat> Ой, прости.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Horde00=Назвавшись «Новой Ордой», вы не избавились от старых грехов.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Impressed00=Что ж, посмотрим, что ты можешь.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Вина лежит на мне. И мне придется жить с этим до конца моих дней.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Неудивительно, что тебя убили твои же люди.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Medic00=Что... Ты о чем? Что-то не так с моим наплечьем? Или с лечащим молотом?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Это ты-то герой? Ха! Да в одном моем сапоге героизма вдвое больше!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Murky00=Что-что? Не расслышал, повтори.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Твой голос мне до боли знаком.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Negative00=Попридержи язык, а? Нам еще сражаться.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NewRace00=Ты из Азерота? Светом клянусь, стоит покинуть планету на пару лет, и все катится в Бездну.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NightElf00=А я уж думал, что высокомернее высших эльфов никого нет.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ха! Покажем этим несчастным, на что мы способны!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Stitches00=Я не удостою это ответом.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=А я думал, смерть делает всех менее агрессивными.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Uncaring00=О, ты надеешься, что мне не все равно? Ну, надейся.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Varian00=За Альянс!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zerg00=Лучше помни, на чьей ты стороне, монстр.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zuljin00=Да. Только такого комментария я и мог ожидать от тролля.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill00=Справедливость восстановлена.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill01=Отправляйся к Свету... И прямо сейчас!
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill02=Настал твой смертный час.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill03=Все кончено.
VoiceOver/Uther/Kill04=Надо было сражаться лучше!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAlliance00=Прости меня, друг...
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAngel00=Хмм. Я что, только что убил целителя душ?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillArthas00=Тебе предстоит сгнить в аду, мальчик.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillChogall00=Похоже, паладины и огры-маги не так уж равноценны.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillCrusader00=Ну что, кто не справился? Кому «не привыкать»?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDemon00=Возвращайся в Пустоту, демон! Или... Куда отсюда попадают?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDiablo00=Этому миру больше не придется терпеть тебе подобных, демон!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillGuldan00=Даже «воплощение мрака» не устоит перед Светом!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillHorde00=Орда новая, а мрете все так же легко.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillJaina00=Мне так жаль...
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKaelthas00=Тебе еще есть чему поучиться, Кель'тас.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKerrigan00=Справедливое возмездие настигло тебя, Керриган.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillMedivh00=Что меч Лотара начал, мой молот закончит!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillPaladin00=Да простит меня Свет.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillRaynor00=Это научит тебя не пропускать тренировки, Рейнор.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillScourge00=Пока я жив, Лордерон не достанется вашей мерзкой Плети!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillSpreeEnd00=Неплохая попытка.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillVarian00=На какой я был строчке?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillWar200=Ох, ностальгия!
VoiceOver/Uther/Laugh00=<смешок>
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal00=Хорошо, что тебе случилось быть рядом.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal01=Я обязан тебе жизнью.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowLifeHeal02=Я бесконечно благодарен тебе!
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana00=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana01=Мне не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/Uther/LowMana02=У меня заканчивается мана.
VoiceOver/Uther/No00=Нет.
VoiceOver/Uther/No01=Невозможно.
VoiceOver/Uther/No02=Я не могу.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistHero00=Нашему союзнику нужна помощь.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe00=Мне бы не помешала помощь.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AssistMe01=Здесь кто-нибудь есть?
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackCastle00=Атакуем цитадель врага!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackMerc00=Мы должны захватить этот лагерь наемников.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Атакуем этот форт!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_AttackTower00=Захватим эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Защищайте форт!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_DefendTower00=Мы должны оборонять нашу сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ping_KillHero00=Мы должны расправиться с этим противником.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed00=На нас благословение Света.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed01=Нас всех озаряет Свет.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed02=Я уже слишком стар для этой чепухи.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed03=Иногда свет в конце тоннеля — это всего лишь огни несущегося на тебя поезда.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed04=Сегодня я буду нести всем боль, а не Свет.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed05=Что... Что случилось с той серебряной дланью в небесах?
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed06=Орден Треугольного Курсора... звучит куда хуже, чем Орден Серебряной Длани.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed07=Вот в мои дни в паладины кого попало не брали.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed08=А уровней у нас было всего 10. Вот у тебя сколько? 100? Больше? <вздыхает> Эх, молодежь...
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed09=<кто-то чихает> Храни тебя Свет!
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed10=А можно еще раз, но немножко левее? Нет-нет, правее, выше, чуть-чуть... и ниже... вот, хорошо! Спасибо, спасибо!
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed11=Да-да, вот здесь!
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed12=Да познают праведники мир, а грешники — мой кулак.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed13=Откройся Свету! Незачем вешать такие плотные шторы.
VoiceOver/Uther/Pissed14=Кстати, один бронзовый дракон рассказал мне, что вы, эльфы крови, собираетесь сделать с моей могилой... Не могу сказать, что я в восторге.
VoiceOver/Uther/Resurrected00=Рад, что ты на моей стороне.
VoiceOver/Uther/Resurrected01=Премного благодарен за спасение.
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive00=За Альянс!
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive01=Справедливость снова восторжествует.
VoiceOver/Uther/Revive02=Ладно, попробуем снова.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec00=Мудрое решение.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec01=Вера — сама по себе награда.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec02=Я могу это использовать.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec03=Прекрасный выбор.
VoiceOver/Uther/Spec04=Во что бы то ни стало.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt00=Покажи мне, что ты умеешь.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt01=Трусость не есть добродетель.
VoiceOver/Uther/Taunt02=У тебя кишка тонка!
VoiceOver/Uther/TeamKilled00=Я уже слишком стар для всего этого.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_ExLocked00=Приветствую тебя!
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_ExPurchased00=Здравствуй.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Gift00=Другой союзник? Уже иду.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Lockin00=Свет всегда с тобой.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Purchase00=За Лордерон!
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Trial00=Посмотри на паладина за работой.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_Trial01=Не испытывай силу Света.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitLocked00=Я — молот правосудия.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitLocked01=Паладины — это костяк Альянса. Тебе, несомненно, пригодится мой опыт.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitPurchased00=Я уже не так молод, дитя, чтобы тратить время зря.
VoiceOver/Uther/UI_WaitPurchased01=Время не ждет. А через минуту и я перестану.
VoiceOver/Uther/Ultimate1Used00=Отбрось все страхи! Свет с тобой!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ultimate1Used01=Наш щит — Свет!
VoiceOver/Uther/Ultimate2Used00=Всепокоряющий Свет!

VoiceOver/Uther/Yes01=Очень мудро.
VoiceOver/Uther/Yes02=Во имя Света!
VoiceOver/Uther/Yes03=Во имя чести!

VoiceOver/Uther/Yes05=Принято.
VoiceOver/Uther/Yes06=Ха, это мне нравится!
VoiceOver/Uther/Yes07=По зову чести.
VoiceOver/Uther/Yes08=Почему бы и нет?
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/AI_Attack00=В атаку! Враг слаб!

VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/IntroResponse_Negative00=Попридержи язык, а? Нам еще сражаться.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ха! Покажем этим несчастным, на что мы способны!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/IntroResponse_Stitches00=Я не удостою это ответом.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Kill00=Справедливость восстановлена.

VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Kill04=Надо было сражаться лучше!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/KillArthas00=Тебе предстоит сгнить в аду, мальчик.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/KillDiablo00=Этому миру больше не придется терпеть тебе подобных, демон!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/KillJaina00=<вздыхает> Мне так жаль...

VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_AttackCastle00=Атакуем цитадель врага!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_AttackMerc00=Нам следует захватить лагерь наемников.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Атакуем этот форт!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_AttackTower00=Давайте захватим эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Capture00=Захватить этот объект.

VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Collect00=Собирайте это, да поживее!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Collect01=Разве их не надо собирать?
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Danger00=Осторожней!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Danger01=Осторожно.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Defend00=Нам нужно защитить эту позицию.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Все на защиту форта!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendStructure00=Это строение не должно пострадать.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendStructure01=Это строение нужно защитить.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendThing00=Защищаем цель!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendThing01=Нужно, чтобы цель не пострадала.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DefendTower00=Мы должны оборонять нашу сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Уничтожить строение.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Пора разрушить эту штуковину.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DestroyThing00=Вот наша цель. Ее следует уничтожить.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_DestroyThing01=Уничтожить цель!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Хм... Враг исчез.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_EnemyMissing01=Мой противник исчез.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_KillHero00=Мы должны расправиться с этим противником.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_OnMyWay00=I'm coming.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_OnMyWay01=Я скоро буду.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ping_Retreat00=Отступаем! Это не последнее сражение.

VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed00=На нас благословение Света.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed01=Нас всех озаряет Свет.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed02=Я уже слишком стар для этой чепухи.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed03=Иногда свет в конце тоннеля — это всего лишь огни несущегося на тебя поезда.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed04=Сегодня я буду нести всем боль, а не Свет.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed05=Что... Что случилось с той серебряной дланью в небесах?
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed06=Орден Треугольного Курсора... звучит куда хуже, чем Орден Серебряной Длани.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed07=Вот в мои дни в паладины кого попало не брали.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed08=А уровней у нас было всего 10. Вот у тебя сколько? 100? Больше? <вздыхает> Эх, молодежь...
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed09=<кто-то чихает> Храни тебя Свет!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed10=А можно еще раз, но немножко левее? Нет-нет, правее, выше, чуть-чуть... и ниже... вот, хорошо! Спасибо, спасибо!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed11=Да-да, вот здесь!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed12=Да познают праведники мир, а грешники — мой кулак.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed13=Откройся Свету! Незачем вешать такие плотные шторы.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Pissed14=Кстати, один бронзовый дракон рассказал мне, что вы, эльфы крови, собираетесь сделать с моей могилой... Не могу сказать, что я в восторге.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Resurrected00=Рад, что ты на моей стороне.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Resurrected01=Премного благодарен за спасение.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeEnd00=Заслуженная участь!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeEnd01=Справедливость неотвратима.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeEnd02=Так будет с каждым, кто предаст идеалы Света.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeStart00=Ты поплатишься жизнью.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeStart01=Справедливость должна быть восстановлена!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/RevengeStart02=Это была твоя роковая ошибка.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Revive00=За Альянс!

VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Social_WellPlayed00=Неплохо сыграно.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Social_WellPlayed01=Ха, неплохой прием.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Spec00=Мудрое решение.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Spec01=Вера — сама по себе награда.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Spec02=Я могу это использовать.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Spec03=Прекрасный выбор.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Spec04=Во что бы то ни стало.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Taunt00=Покажи мне, что ты умеешь.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Taunt01=Трусость не есть добродетель.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Taunt02=У тебя кишка тонка!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/TeamKilled00=Я уже слишком стар для всего этого.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/UI_ExLocked00=Приветствую тебя!

VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/UI_Trial00=Посмотри на паладина за работой.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/UI_Trial01=Не испытывай силу Света.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/UI_WaitLocked00=Я — молот правосудия.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/UI_WaitLocked01=Паладины — это костяк Альянса. Тебе, несомненно, пригодится мой опыт.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/UI_WaitPurchased00=Я уже не так молод, дитя, чтобы тратить время зря.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/UI_WaitPurchased01=Время не ждет. А через минуту и я перестану.
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ultimate1Used00=Отбрось все страхи! Свет с тобой!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ultimate1Used01=Наш щит — Свет!
VoiceOver/UtherJudgement/Ultimate2Used00=Всепокоряющий Свет!

VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiablo00=Это тебе за Лию!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiabloHero00=Хм. Ты вообще кто?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillJaina00=Маги не идут ни в какое сравнение с чародеями.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillKaelthas00=Эльфы-маги мне не ровня...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillLeoric00=Сколько еще раз мне придется тебя убить?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMalthael00=А здесь тебя куда проще убить.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMedivh00=Дуэль чародеев окончена. Ты проиграл.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillNephalem00=Я этого не хотела... Правда!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillSpreeEnd00=(смеется) Было даже весело.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillTyrael00=Прости меня, друг...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillWeird00=По-моему, смерть для такого уродца — это благо. Фу.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh00=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh01=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh02=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh03=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh04=<larger laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal00=Благодарю за милость, лекарь.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal01=У меня новый ангел-хранитель?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal02=У тебя отличное чувство времени!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana00=Мне нужна мана.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana01=Мне не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana02=Нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No00=И зачем бы мне это делать?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No01=Нет уж.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No02=Я не стану этого делать.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Этому герою стоит помочь.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Кто-нибудь, помогите!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Мне... нужна помощь.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Пора нанести удар по их цитадели!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Я хочу захватить этот лагерь наемников.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Атакуем этот форт!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Нужно захватить эту сторожевую башню!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Не дайте разрушить нашу цитадель! Мы же проиграем!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Нужно защитить этот форт. Живее!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Нам стоит защитить эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_KillHero00=Нужно убить этого героя.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed00=Я исполню предначертанное.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed01=Магия всегда давалась мне легко.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed02=Да, это я уничтожила святилище Ишари. Но у меня не было выбора!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed03=Совсем не рвешься в бой? Или тебе просто нравится меня рассматривать?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed04=Да-да, я изучала древние тайны магии только для того, чтобы мне докучал кто-то вроде тебя...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed05=(угрожающе) Может, мне опробовать в деле заклинание немоты?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed06=Посмотрим, как тебе понравится вот это! <SFX: Magic casting sound>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed07=(Muffled sounds of confusion as the Wizard realizes she silenced herself)
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed08=<SFX: Magic casting sound> Ох, я, эм-м, никогда так не ошибалась.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed09=Расскажешь об этом хоть кому-то, и я вышибу тебя из этого мира в мир иной.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed10=Учителя всегда говорили мне, что я очень самолюбива. Чушь... Я себя не люблю. Я себя обожаю. <хихикает>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed11=Интересно, что имеет в виду Кормак, когда говорит, что у Эйрины сферы лучше, чем у меня?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed12=Однажды я запустила во Тьму магическую стрелу... Она мне потом неделю звонила с угрозами...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed13=Вычислить путь звезды, и развести сады, и укротить тайфун – все может магия!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed14=Изендра была прекрасным учителем. Но она поделилась со мной не всеми секретами. Я до сих пор пытаюсь понять, как ей удавалось телепортироваться так быстро... Да еще и без перезарядки!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed15=Как я получаю силы? Оборачиваю мир вокруг себя!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected00=Ты мой новый любимый лекарь!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected01=Ты даже лучше закарумских жрецов!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive00=Похоже, сегодня смерть мне не грозит.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive01=Ох. Не этого я хотела.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive02=Я должна быть осторожнее. Или нет...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec00=Моя сила растет.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec01=Отлично.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec02=Видели бы меня сейчас мои наставники...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec03=Мои знания растут.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec04=Я стала еще могущественнее.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt00=Надеюсь, ты упокоишься с миром.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt01=Сейчас твоя жизнь оборвется!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt02=Я с радостью тебя убью!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/TeamKilled00=Положение сложное, но мы не должны терять надежду.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_ExLocked00=Нужна помощь чародейки?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Я пришла, чтобы помочь.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Gift00=Я отправлюсь туда, где во мне нуждаются.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Lockin00=Я нужна этому миру.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Purchase00=А ты мне нравишься.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial00=Хочешь мной полюбоваться? (смеется)
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial01=Магия – это не игрушка, с ней шутки плохи. Ну, ладно, ладно...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Скажи лишь слово, и я приду.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Я не только создаю проблемы. Я их еще и решаю.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Сколько можно ждать?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Надо двигаться вперед.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used00=Я слишком сильна для вас!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used01=Тебе конец!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used02=Почувствуй мощь тайной магии!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used03=<laughs>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate2Used00=Прочь!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate2Used01=Довольно!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VOX_Cheer00=<Cheering exertion>

VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineOne00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineThree00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/VoiceLineTwo00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/WorthIt00=Ха! Достала! Остальное не важно.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/WorthIt01=Могло быть и хуже.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes00=П-ф-ф. Ладно.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes01=Хорошо.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes02=Ну вот, опять.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes03=Куда на этот раз?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes04=Похоже, мое путешествие никогда не кончится.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes05=Что я вообще здесь делаю?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes06=Иногда я скучаю по Калдею.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes07=Будь это легко, любой бы справился.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes08=Мои заклинания готовы.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Yes09=Почему бы и нет?
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack00=В атаку! Наш враг ослаблен!
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack01=Противник показал свою слабость! Нападаем!
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Attack02=Да, я вижу. Настало время нанести удар!
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Caution00=Будьте настороже, наш противник что-то замышляет.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob00=Великолепная работа.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob01=Нас никто не остановит.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_GoodJob02=Чудесно.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Heal00=Иди подлечись. Немедленно.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Heal01=Беги к исцеляющему фонтану, пока еще можешь.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Retreat00=Я должна отступить.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Retreat01=Я отступаю. Но это временно.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh00=Жалкий ход.
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh01=<Резкое злобное рычание.>
VoiceOver/Zagara/AI_Uhoh02=Неожиданный поворот.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack00=Мы поглощаем все.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack01=Моя добыча близко.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack02=Ощути ярость Роя!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack03=Я – твоя погибель.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack04=<angry growl>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack05=Рой сокрушит тебя!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Attack06=Ты заплатишь за все!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Celebrate00=Во славу Роя!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Celebrate01=Мы победили!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Comeback00=Мы тесним врага. Не отступать!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death00=<Предсмертный возглас>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death01=<Предсмертный возглас>

VoiceOver/Zagara/Death06=<Предсмертный возглас>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Death07=<Предсмертный возглас>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed00=Отлично, слуга.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed01=Мои раны затянулись.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Healed02=Я исцелена.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree00=<Смеется> Хорошо.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree01=Любой, кто выступит против нас, умрет.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroAgree02=Рой покорит всех!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroBoast00=Мы разорвем их на куски!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroBoast01=Да познает враг всю ярость Роя!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion00=Мы готовы?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion01=Порвем их на части?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Abathur00=Не подведи меня, мастер эволюции.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Anubarak00=А ты бы хорошо вписался в мою стаю.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Kerrigan00=Моя королева...
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Хм... ты любопытное создание.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Опять ты...
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Наконец-то достойный союзник.

VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond00=Рой готов.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond01=Да не вопрос.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroRespond02=Мы эволюционируем... и мы завоюем.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Abathur00=Наше время пришло, Абатур! Во славу Роя!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Anubarak00=Какая гадость.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Kerrigan00=Несомненно.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Murky00=Что это ты только что сказал?
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Negative00=Молчать. Мы должны сражаться, а не беседовать.
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Positive00=Покажем этим глупцам всю силу Роя!
VoiceOver/Zagara/IntroResponse_Sonya00=<Do not record: Reuses Zagara_IntroRespond00>

VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill00=Пади перед Роем!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill01=Ничтожное создание.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill02=Ничтожество!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill03=Для тебя надежды не было.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Kill04=Победа за мной.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillAbathur00=Твое место в эволюционном отсеке, а не на поле боя.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillDemon00=Какая сильная эссенция! Абатур должен ее исследовать...
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillKerrigan00=Теперь я — сердце Роя!
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillProtoss00=Как я люблю слышать хруст протосских костей.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillSpreeEnd00=Твое время истекло.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillTerran00=Бесполезный терран.
VoiceOver/Zagara/KillZagara00=Я первая из всех матерей стаи!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Zagara/Laugh01=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal00=Я здорова! Спасибо.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal01=Благодарю за спасение.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowLifeHeal02=Как раз вовремя, слуга.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana00=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana01=Мана кончается.
VoiceOver/Zagara/LowMana02=Мне не хватает маны.
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd00=На какой я был строчке?
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd01=На какой я был строчке?
VoiceOver/Zagara/MatchEnd02=На какой я был строчке?
VoiceOver/Zagara/No00=Я не могу повиноваться.
VoiceOver/Zagara/No01=Невозможно.
VoiceOver/Zagara/No02=Нет, я не могу.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistHero00=Помогите нашему союзнику!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistMe00=Моя стая атакована!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AssistMe01=Противник напал на меня!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackCastle00=Уничтожим цитадель противника!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackMerc00=Нам нужно захватить этот лагерь наемников.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Нужно уничтожить этот форт.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_AttackTower00=Нам нужно захватить эту сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendCastle00=Защищайте цитадель.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Нужно защищать этот форт.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_DefendTower00=Нам надо защищать сторожевую башню.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ping_KillHero00=Этот герой должен умереть.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed00=Моя стая готова.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed01=Рой жаждет крови.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed02=Тебе еще хватает надзирателей?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed03=Я королева смерти.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed04=У тебя нет крема для ЗАГАРА?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed05=Да нет у меня насморка! А слизь — это хроническое. Не лечится.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed06=Боже, храни королеву! Все остальные могут умирать.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed07=Нелегко быть матерью-одиночкой стаи: нужно как-то прокормить 4,5 миллиона зергов.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed08=Хоть и мать, но еще не замужем!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed09=Когда я стану Королевой Клинков, то больше не позволю так с собой обращаться.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed10=Мне всего четыре года, а я уже мать стаи. Как летит время...
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed11=<долгие зергоподобные звуки> Прости, немножко першит в горле.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed12=Отвернись! Тебя не учили, что неприлично смотреть, как появляются личинки?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed13=Если мне надоест быть матерью стаи, пойду работать учительницей биологии.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Pissed14=Путь к сердцу террана лежит через его грудную клетку.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Resurrected00=Вместе мы непобедимы.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Resurrected01=Восстановление завершено.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Revive00=Рой вечен.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Revive01=От меня так просто не избавиться.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Revive02=Я вновь и вновь буду возвращаться в битву.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec00=Мутация завершена.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec01=Да, это подойдет.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec02=Я уже чувствую себя сильнее.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec03=Замечательно.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Spec04=Теперь меня ничто не остановит.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Taunt00=Я – Загара. Услышь меня и содрогнись!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Taunt01=Тебе не на что надеяться.
VoiceOver/Zagara/Taunt02=Тебя ждет лишь смерть!
VoiceOver/Zagara/TeamKilled00=За это они поплатятся жизнью.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_ExLocked00=Говори, терран.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_ExPurchased00=Чем я могу помочь тебе?
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Gift00=Надо завоевать еще один мир?
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Lockin00=Рой выстоит.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Purchase00=Рой слышит твой приказ.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Trial00=Моя стая пройдет любые испытания.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_Trial01=Позволь мне продемонстрировать тебе славу Роя.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitLocked00=Ты испытываешь мое терпение.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitLocked01=Это время мы могли бы провести на поле боя.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitPurchased00=Твое бездействие бессмысленно. Наверное, тебе не хватает видения.
VoiceOver/Zagara/UI_WaitPurchased01=Я жажду раскрошить кости врагов своими когтями. Начнем?
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used00=Земля дрожит...
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used01=Приди, червь Нидуса!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used02=Узрите червя Нидуса!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate1Used03=Рой воспрял!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate2Used00=Рой поглотит все!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate2Used01=Сожри всех врагов!
VoiceOver/Zagara/Ultimate2Used02=Познай наш голод.

VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Artanis00=Мой клинок всегда к твоим услугам, иерарх.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Нет. Я не такой, как ты.

VoiceOver/Zeratul/IntroResponse_Tassadar00=И мы будем сражаться с честью, друг.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Kill00=Отправляйся в Пустоту.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Kill01=Здесь оборвется нить твоей судьбы!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Kill02=За ошибки приходится платить.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Kill03=Тебя ждет Пустота!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Kill04=Прочь.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/KillIllidan00=Ступай во тьму, которая уже начала поглощать тебя.

VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowLifeHeal01=Жизнь вновь наполняет меня.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowLifeHeal02=Мой день еще не настал.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowMana00=Недостаточно маны.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowMana01=У меня мало маны.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/LowMana02=Мне нужно больше маны.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/No00=Это нельзя сделать.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/No01=Не могу.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/No02=Нет.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AssistHero00=Союзнику нужна помощь.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AssistMe00=Мне... не справиться!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AssistMe01=Враг превосходит нас числом!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ping_AttackCastle00=Уничтожим вражескую цитадель.

VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed01=Я изгоню демонов прошлого.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed02=Лезвия-косы неплохи, но я — рыцарь плаща и кинжала.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed03=Ты не поверишь, как легко проскользнуть на борт корабля.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed04=Маленький скачок для меня, но огромный прыжок для всего человечества.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed05=<Чихание> Что это было? Как у меня вообще это получилось?!
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed06=Медленная речь и клинки искривления — это стильно.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed07=Мне следует использовать свои способности для атаки вражеских героев. Также нужно выяснить, почему я все время разговариваю сам с собой.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed08=Я несу мрачные вести… Не бойся, мне просто нравится так говорить.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed09=Тьма — мой союзник... но мы не слишком это афишируем, а то Пустота будет ревновать.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed10=Есть пророчество об Избранном, что принесет баланс в Си... ой. Не то пророчество. <Пауза> Еще немного, и нас бы засудили.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed11=Странная у людей анатомия. Если всего один палец противопоставлен прочим, как нормально удержать оружие?
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed12=Тьма оплетает меня. Вообще-то она здорово стесняет движения... <Пауза> Кто-нибудь в курсе, как это прекратить?
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed13=Знаешь, иногда мне хочется вернуться к свету. Позагорать на пляже...
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Pissed14=Давным-давно прорицатель из нашего народа предсказал явление героя, который приведет мой клинок к победе. Так вот, это не про тебя.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Resurrected00=Спасибо.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Resurrected01=Мой день еще не настал.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Revive00=Я сделаю, что должно.

VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_WaitLocked01=Я стану твоим клинком, скрытым в тенях.
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_WaitPurchased00=Известно ли тебе, насколько я стар? И ты все равно заставляешь меня ждать?
VoiceOver/Zeratul/UI_WaitPurchased01=Темные тамплиеры любят странствия... И не слишком любят сидеть на месте и бездельничать. <Откашливается>
VoiceOver/Zeratul/Ultimate1Used00=Твоя судьба предрешена!
