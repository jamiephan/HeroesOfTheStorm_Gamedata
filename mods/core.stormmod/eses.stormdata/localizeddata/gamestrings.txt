UI/QuestLine/Event/Toys/Repeatable/Quest3/Flavor=Luchar por una buena causa no es fácil... Y por una mala, tampoco. Mira a la marioneta de Auriel, por ejemplo: ¡cree que deberíamos ser todos amigos! ¡Sé amable y gana 2 partidas con héroes de apoyo!
UI/QuestLine/Event/Toys/Repeatable/Quest4/Flavor=Aunque Carnicerín sea pequeño, ¡sigue siendo un carnicero! Además, cuando se pone a hacer algo pedazos, lo hace de la forma más adorable del mundo.

Pasa mucho tiempo con sus mejores amigos, diciendo cosas graciosas. ¡Me encanta! Ah, ¡tengo una idea! ¿Por qué no molas tanto como Chuleto y juegas 3 partidas? Una misión facilita.
UI/QuestLine/Event/Toys/Repeatable/Quest8/Flavor=¡Los miembros de la Fuerza Cósmica son los defensores de todo! Además, tienen una canción muy chula... ¡Vamos a ver si tienes lo que hay que tener para unirte a ellos! Intenta ganar 2 partidas con un héroe guerrero. ¡Ese sería un buen comienzo!

UI/QuestLine/Event/Toys/Unique/Dehaka/Flavor=Mi Dehakasaurio Rex se ha hecho daño mientras protegía su reino de los invasores. Recoge «piezas de repuesto» de otros héroes. ¡Es la única forma de arreglarlo!
UI/QuestLine/Event/Toys/Unique/Lion/Flavor=Genial, ¡a mi León Cósmico se le han acabado las pilas! Dale esbirros de comer y puede que eso las recargue. O al menos creo que eso sirve de algo. Me lo dijo alguien... en algún sitio...
UI/QuestLine/Event/Toys/Unique/Stitches/Flavor=Qué raro, antes esto era una carta de Mefisto... Bueno, Puntos osito achuchable necesita que lo arreglen. ¡Un par de bobinas de hilo y como nuevo! He oído que hay unas cuantas dentro del núcleo enemigo, ¿puedes comprobarlo?
UI/QuestLine/Event/Toys/Unique/Unicorn/Flavor=Un terrible... esto... impacto... ha aplastado el establo de Pezuñina el Unicornio. ¡Hay que construirle uno nuevo! Destruye fuertes y fortalezas enemigas para conseguir material para el establo.
UI/QuestLine/Event/Toys/Unique/Valeera/Flavor=Puede que haya intentado abrir una caja usando las hojas de Valeera Cósmica... Sí, no ha sido muy inteligente por mi parte, pero tenemos que afilar las armas antes de que mi hermana se entere. ¡Ve a luchar contra algo! ¿Porfa?

UI/QuestLine/Event/Toys2019/Emcee/QuestUnique4Start=No puedes ganar batallas en solitario, por mucho que te consuma el odio. Recluta mercenarios en los campos de batalla y que marchen hacia los baluartes... o cajones de arena del enemigo.
