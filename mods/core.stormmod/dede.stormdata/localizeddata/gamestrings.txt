Missile/BlendAtNotGreaterThanStopAt=Überblenden bei [%1] nicht > Stoppen bei [%2]. Bewegungskoppler [%3] in Phasen [%4, %5]. Die Ausblendebeendigungsentfernung einer beliebigen Phase muss weiter reichen als die Stoppentfernung der vorherigen Phase.
Missile/CannotHaveBlendOnFinalPhase=Kann keine Blende in der finalen Phase haben. Bewegungskoppler [%1].
Missile/CannotHaveNegativeOutroRanges=Kann keine negative Bereiche für Outro haben. Bewegungskoppler [%1] Phase [%2].
Missile/CannotHaveZeroStopAtDistanceOnZeroethPhase=Kann null nicht als "stoppen bei"-Entfernung in der nullten Phase haben, wenn es mehr als eine Phase gibt. Bewegungskoppler [%1].
Missile/CannotPowerslideOnNonPositiveAccel=Kann Schlitterzustand nicht bei Phasen mit nicht-positiver Beschleunigung verwenden. Bewegungskoppler [%1] Phase [%2].
Missile/EmptyThrowVector=Ungültiger Wurfvektor. Bewegungskoppler [%1] Phase [%2].
Missile/InvalidPitchThrowBand=Ungültiges X-Achsenwurfband. Bewegungskoppler [%1] Phase [%2].
Missile/InvalidYawThrowBand=Ungültiges Y-Achsenwurfband. Bewegungskoppler [%1] Phase [%2].
Missile/NoMotionDriver=Kein Bewegungstreiber. [%1] Phase [%2].
Missile/StopAtNotGreaterThanOrEqualToBlendAt=Stoppen bei [%1] nicht >= Überblenden bei [%2]. Bewegungskoppler [%3] in Phase [0]. Die Entfernung, bei der die Phase komplett stoppt, muss dort oder weiter entfernt sein als die Entfernung, wo das Ausblenden der Phase beginnt.
Missile/StopAtNotGreaterThanOrEqualToBlendAtPhase=Stoppen bei [%1] nicht >= Überblenden bei [%2]. Bewegungskoppler [%3] in Phase [%4]. Die Entfernung, bei der die Phase komplett stoppt, muss dort oder weiter entfernt sein als die Entfernung, wo das Ausblenden der Phase beginnt.
Missile/UnsupportedNegativeBlendAtAndPositiveStopAt=Nicht unterstützt - negatives Überblenden bei [%1] und positives Stoppen bei [%2]. Bewegungskoppler [%3] in Phase [%4]. Kann den Start der Ausblendung einer Phase nicht im Bezug auf das Ziel definieren, wenn gleichzeitig die finale Stoppentfernung dieser Phase im Bezug auf den Start definiert ist. Das würde variierende und wahrscheinlich unerwartete Verhalten als Start- und Zielpunkte mit unterschiedlichen Entfernungen zueinander erzeugen.
Missile/UnsupportedNonGroundHeightMap=CBewegungselement - Geschoss [%1]; Geschosse unterstützen nur die Bodenhöhenkarte. Die Lufthöhenkarte ermöglicht es Flugeinheiten, sich sanft über Klippen zu bewegen. Sie bezieht sich nicht auf Geschossen und würde nur zu "Glitches" in den Geschossen führen, die sich nahe dem Boden befinden müssen. Deshalb wird sie von Geschossen ignoriert.
Missile/ZeroGravityOnBallisticMover=Fehlende Gravitation auf dem ballistischen Bewegungskoppler. Bewegungskoppler [%1] Phase [%2].

UI/VideoOptionsInstructions=Du kannst Videoaufnahmen während des Spiels aktivieren und deaktivieren, indem du STRG+F11 drückst, während du spielst oder ein Replay anschaust. Videos werden im Unterordner "Videos" des "Heroes of the Storm"-Ordners deines Benutzerverzeichnisses im Format Theora OGV gespeichert. Videos in hoher Qualität aufzuzeichnen kann dein Spielerlebnis erheblich beeinträchtigen.
UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/AudioQuality=<c val="ffffff">Audioqualität:</c><n/>Das Erhöhen der Audioqualität sorgt für größere Klangtreue, resultiert aber auch in größeren Videodateien.
UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/FrameRate=<c val="ffffff">Framerate:</c><n/>Framerate bezeichnet die Anzahl an Frames pro Sekunde. Eine höhere Framerate führt zu flüssigerer Video-Wiedergabe auf Kosten größerer Videodateien. Aufnahmen mit höherer Framerate können dein Spielerlebnis beinflussen.
UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/RecordAudioCheckbox=<c val="ffffff">Audio aktivieren:</c><n/>Aktiviert die Aufnahme von Audio zusammen mit Video.
UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/RecordTriggers=<c val="ffffff">Über Auslöser aufnehmen:</c><n/>Das Aktivieren dieser Option erlaubt das Aufnehmen von Videos über Ingame-Auslöser. Spieler können Karten mit Auslösern der Kategorie "Film - Aufnahme beginnen" erstellen, um die Aufnahme von Filmen zu vereinfachen. Lass diese Option ausgeschaltet, wenn du auf solchen Karten keine automatisch aufgezeichneten Videos wünschst.
UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/Resolution=<c val="ffffff">Auflösung:</c><n/>Legt die Größe des aufgezeichneten Videos in Pixeln fest. Höhere Auflösungen haben eine bessere Bildqualität, beeinflussen aber bei der Aufnahme die Leistung stärker. Wähle für optimale Resultate eine Auflösung, die dem Seitenverhältnis deines Spiels entspricht.
UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/SlowGame=<c val="ffffff">Spiel während der Aufnahme verlangsamen:</c><n/>Legt fest, ob das Spiel während der Aufnahme von Videos verlangsamt wird, um den Leistungsabfall zu kompensieren. Dies resultiert in besserer Videoqualität, kann aber während Mehrspielerpartien nicht angewendet werden. Videos, die mit dieser Option aufgenommen werden, werden den Abfall der Framerate aufnehmen, aber die Audios werden davon nicht betroffen.
UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/VideoQuality=<c val="ffffff">Videoqualität:</c><n/>Legt die Kompressionsrate fest, die während der Aufnahme von Videos verwendet wird. Höhere Videoqualität resultiert in besserer Bildqualität, aber auch in weit größeren Videodateien.
