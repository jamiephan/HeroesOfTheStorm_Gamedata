Missile/StopAtNotGreaterThanOrEqualToBlendAtPhase=ZatrzymajPrzy[%1] nie >= MieszajPrzy[%2].  Poruszacz[%3] Faza[%4]. Odległość, na której faza całkowicie się zatrzymuje musi być większa lub równa odległości, na której faza zaczyna się odróżniać.
Missile/UnsupportedNegativeBlendAtAndPositiveStopAt=Nieobsługiwane - ujemne MieszajPrzy[%1] i dodatnie ZatrzymajPrzy[%2].  Poruszacz[%3] Faza[%4]. Nie można określić początku odróżnienia fazy względem celu przy jednoczesnym określeniu końcowej odległości zatrzymania tej fazy względem punktu początkowego. Skutkowałoby to zróżnicowanymi i najprawdopodobniej nieprzewidywalnymi zachowaniami, ponieważ punkt początkowy i punkt docelowy znajdują się na różnych odległościach względem siebie.
Missile/UnsupportedNonGroundHeightMap=CPoruszaczPocisk[%1]; Pociski obsługują wyłącznie mapę wysokości podłoża. Mapa wysokości powietrza pozwala lataczom poruszać się gładko nad klifami - nie obsługuje i powoduje jedynie występowanie błędów w przypadku pocisków, które muszą lecieć nisko nad ziemią. Dlatego nie wykorzystuje się jej w tym przypadku.

UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/FrameRate=<c val="ffffff">Klatki na sekundę</c><n/>Wartość ta odnosi się do liczby wyświetlanych klatek na sekundę. Wyższa wartość oznacza płynniejsze odtwarzanie wideo kosztem większych plików, co wiąże się ze spowolnieniem nagrywania.

Wyłącz tę opcję, jeśli nie chcesz automatycznie nagrywać filmów na niektórych mapach.
UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/Resolution=<c val="ffffff">Rozdzielczość</c><n/>Określa rozmiar nagrywanego wideo w pikselach. Wyższa rozdzielczość zapewnia dużo lepszą jakość obrazu, ale nagrywanie jest wolniejsze. Najlepsze wyniki uzyskasz po dopasowaniu rozdzielczości do proporcji obrazu w grze.
UI/VideoOptionsTooltips/SlowGame=<c val="ffffff">Spowolnij grę podczas nagrywania</c><n/>Opcja ta określa, czy prędkość gry ma zostać zmniejszona, aby dostosować się do spadku wydajności spowodowanego nagrywaniem pliku wideo. Dzięki temu nagrany film będzie miał lepszą jakość, jednak funkcji tej nie można wykorzystać w grze wieloosobowej. Jeśli opcja spowolnienia jest wyłączona, film zostanie nagrany z mniejszą liczbą klatek na sekundę. Ścieżka dźwiękowa pozostanie bez zmian.
