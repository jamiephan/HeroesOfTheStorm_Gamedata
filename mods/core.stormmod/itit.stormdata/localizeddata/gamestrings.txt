Missile/BlendAtNotGreaterThanStopAt=BlendAt[%1] not > StopAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phases[%4, %5]. La distanza di termine dissolvenza di una determinata fase deve essere superiore della distanza di arresto della fase precedente.
Missile/CannotHaveBlendOnFinalPhase=Impossibile avere una fusione in fase finale. Motore[%1].
Missile/CannotHaveNegativeOutroRanges=Impossibile avere portate negative di conclusione. Motore[%1] Fase[%2].
Missile/CannotHaveZeroStopAtDistanceOnZeroethPhase=Impossibile avere distanza 0 in FermaIn su fase azzerata se esiste più di 1 fase. Motore[%1].
Missile/CannotPowerslideOnNonPositiveAccel=Impossibile usare scivolate di potenza nelle fasi con accelerazione non positive. Motore[%1] Fase[%2].
Missile/EmptyThrowVector=Vettore di lancio vuoto. Motore[%1] Fase[%2].
Missile/InvalidPitchThrowBand=Beccheggio banda di lancio non valido. Motore[%1] Fase[%2].
Missile/InvalidYawThrowBand=Imbardata banda di lancio non valida. Motore[%1] Fase[%2].
Missile/NoMotionDriver=Nessun pilota movimento. Motore[%1] Fase[%2].
Missile/StopAtNotGreaterThanOrEqualToBlendAt=StopAt[%1] not >= BlendAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[0]. La distanza di termine di una fase deve essere pari o superiore alla distanza di inizio dissolvenza.
Missile/StopAtNotGreaterThanOrEqualToBlendAtPhase=StopAt[%1] not >= BlendAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[%4]. La distanza di termine di una fase deve essere pari o superiore alla distanza di inizio dissolvenza.
Missile/UnsupportedNegativeBlendAtAndPositiveStopAt=Unsupported - negative BlendAt[%1] and positive StopAt[%2].  Mover[%3] Phase[%4]. Impossibile specificare l'inizio della dissolvenza per una fase rispetto al bersaglio mentre si specifica la distanza di termine della fase rispetto al punto di lancio. Questo creerebbe comportamenti variabili e inaspettati dal momento che la distanza fra i punti di lancio e di destinazione varia.
Missile/UnsupportedNonGroundHeightMap=CMoverMissile[%1]; i missili supportano solo la mappa quote del suolo. La mappa quote aerea permette ai volanti di muoversi fluidamente sopra i dislivelli -- non assiste i missili e causa errori nei missili che devono essere vicini al terreno. Viene quindi ignorata per i missili.
