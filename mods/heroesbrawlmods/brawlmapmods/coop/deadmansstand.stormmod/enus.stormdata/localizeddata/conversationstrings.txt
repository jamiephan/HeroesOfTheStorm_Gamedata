Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00039=Time to celebrate!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00040=Wonderful, darling! I might just hire you again. Might.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00041=Do you think Mira Han is going down without a fight? Ha!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00042=No! We're on our own!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00047=Ah, reinforcements! A bit strange, but you'll do. The zerg are preparing an assault against us.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00048=I need your help to defend this base... and these people. We may be criminals, but we still deserve to live. Yes?
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00049=Gates open in 10 seconds. 
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00050=Zerg inbound. Assume defensive positions!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00051=Darlings, some of my goliaths and hellbats have become infested.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00052=Take them out, will you? Whatever's left over can be used to reinforce our defenses!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00053=Clean and efficient.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00054=The zerg assault is petering out. Just a little longer!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00055=(drawn out)So... Good news first! The zerg onslaught has waned.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00056=Also, one of our Archangels has become infested. In four minutes it will bombard our base with Scourge and kill us all. Sorry.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00057=A friendly reminder. A giant volley of scourge will soon destroy us all. So, take down that Archangel, would you?
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00058=30 seconds until we all die horrific deaths.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00059=Archangel destroyed! Oh, that certainly riled the zerg up... Little monsters are already on the attack!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00060=Get back to base quickly. Please.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00061=The zerg attack waves are slowing. Whatever you're doing, do not stop.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00062=Ugh. Two Archangels now! Two!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00063=Look, take out both before they fire scourge at my beautiful base.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00064=Both archangels must be destroyed. There is not much time left!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00065=Both archangels are down, I knew I liked you. Wait, sensors are detecting movement. Another assault?
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00066=Well, I have a surprise. We've been retrofitting our Core with a psi-disruptor I... "acquired."
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00067=It will be tough, but if you can hold back the zerg for three more minutes, this thing'll roast every last one in the city.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00068=The psi disruption pulse is almost ready. Just a little longer!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00069=Ha ha! We've done it! The zerg are gone! Oh, I'm so happy I could kiss every last one of you. Except you. You go over there.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00070=Bunker down! Shore up our defenses!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00071=No! My planetary fortress! Ugh! Well, that's five hundred and fifty minerals I'm never getting back...
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00072=Ten seconds until the gates open. Ready your weapons.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00073=Ten seconds. Put on your big girl pants.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00074=Here they come! Weapons free!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00075=The zerg are moving! Shoot them until they stop.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00078=The zerg's assault is beginning to weaken. Hold out a little longer.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00079=Keep fighting! These beasts can't maintain much longer.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00082=Do not forget about the Archangel. It could vaporize us any moment.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00083=The Archangel is preparing to launch its payload. If it does, people WILL die.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00084=30 seconds left. Take out the archangel... quickly!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00085=Only 30 seconds left! Hurry!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00086=Finally, the zerg are running out of steam. Keep fighting!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00087=Not much longer. Their assault is already weakening.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00088=You must destroy both of the archangels! Please, we must save these people!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00089=30 seconds left. You are our only hope for survival, heroes! Do what you do best!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00090=(aside)Is the psi-disruptor ready? What am I paying you for? These heroes are putting everything on the line!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00091=Hold a little longer! Al-most... there...
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00092=Look out, the zerg just took down a bunker.
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00093=<Angry exertion> We've lost a bunker!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00094=The planetary fortress has fallen. Do not let them reach our core!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00095=Planetary fortress down! Rally at the core!
Conversation/DeadmanPVEVO/Line00096=Bunker down. Bunker down!
