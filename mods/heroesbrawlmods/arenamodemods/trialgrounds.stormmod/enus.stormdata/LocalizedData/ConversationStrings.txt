Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00001=Heroes... How dare you bring your war to Luxoria...
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00002=These temples were built for my worship. In the hands of my chosen warriors they are a powerful weapon.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00004=But you... I do not grant you my power.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00005=Should you try to claim the temples... my guardians will cleave you in twain.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00006=Turn back now. Before you are found... lacking.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00007=The light of the sun grows within the temples. Soon they shall bask in my glory.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00008=Yes, my magic flows through the temples... Guardians, do not let these mortals approach them.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00009=Energy courses through the my temples. My guardians rise once more.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00010=Guardians, rise! Defend my power from these mortal unbelievers.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00011=The magic flows through the temples once more. You do not deserve their power.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00012=The light of the sun shines on my temples. Guardians, be ready... The mortals will surely try again.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00021=Well done, my servants. They are undeserving of my power!
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00022=I warned you mortals. You are unworthy of my glory.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00023=Too much for you, wasn't it?
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00024=Yes. Run, like the insects you are.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00025=My temples' magic subsides. Find something else to fight over.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00026=And so the light fades from my temples... but it will return again. <chuckle>
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00027=Hmm. My temples' power has been expended. You are stronger than I believed. 
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00028=You have stolen enough of my temples' power. Return to your "war," heroes.
Conversation/CapturePointsVO/Line00030=The magic of the temples sleeps... until I choose otherwise.

Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00001=We've been studying the Nexus so that we can better defend ourselves against it. I'll need your help to test our results.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00002=The experimental Nexus ordnance is being readied for a field test. Prepare to assist.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00003=I have high hopes for this next weapons test. We will combat the Nexus with its own power.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00004=By harnessing the power of the Nexus, we can use its own strength to keep it in check. But our new tech requires testing.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00005=Our research into the properties of the Nexus has yielded a new type of weapon. Now, to test it.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00006=Testing is about to commence. Let's see what the Nexus is capable of.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00007=The Nexus weapon will be operational soon. Be ready to use it.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00008=I hope you're ready, heroes. The Nexus weapon will be online shortly.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00009=It's almost time. I look forward to seeing this weapon in action.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00010=This weapon is particularly dangerous. So... proceed with caution.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00011=We've attempted to replicate the Raven Lord's curse. Collect the tribute to harness its power.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00012=It's such a strange looking thing, but this tribute holds great power. Claim it as your own.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00013=This weapon is based on the Raven Lord's tribute. Activate it to debilitate your opponents.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00014=The tribute has greatly weakened your enemies. Press your advantage!
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00015=This curse is impressive. Your opponents are now at death's door.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00016=Such power... perhaps copying the Raven Lord wasn't that wise...
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00017=The tribute has cursed you. I had no idea it would have such a devastating effect.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00018=Oh my. Even a copy of the Raven Lord's curse packs quite the punch.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00019=The curse has nearly killed you. Do not let your enemies finish the job.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00020=It's time, heroes. Control the terminal and bring in the Protector.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00021=Access terminal online. Secure it to activate the Protector.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00022=Power routed to the terminal. Control it, and you can pilot the Protector.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00023=Protector online. Give me a full demonstration.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00024=Preparations complete. Pilot the Protector to victory.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00025=Impress me, heroes. The Protector is waiting for you.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00026=Enemy Protector online. Prepare your defenses.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00027=You're about to see the Protector's power up close. Be ready for it.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00028=It looks like you have a hostile Protector on your hands. Destroy it, if you can.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00029=You've pushed the Protector to its limit. Well done.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00030=So that's the extent of the Protector's power. Impressive.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00031=Test concluded. Now, we'll make adjustments accordingly.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00032=One of these artificial immortals needs to prevail in order to use its power. Make sure it's yours.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00033=Two artificial immortals. Only one can win. Assist yours immediately!
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00035=Your immortal has won. Now your enemies will feel its wrath.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00036=Ah, so the immortal provides both recon and firepower. I'll make a note of that.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00038=Watch out! The enemy's immortal is about to strike.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00039=The enemy immortal has won. Be ready to withstand its onslaught.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00041=I'm activating the Nexus Barrier. Stand inside to avoid the volatile energy.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00042=Nexus Barrier online. It will shield you from the volatile energy.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00044=It seems we have a weapon malfunction. Carry on as usual, heroes.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00046=What? There's no weapon on the platform! Who's responsible for this?
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00047=To be honest, I'm not sure how this next one works. Why don't you find that out?
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00048=I'm unfamiliar with this experiment. You're on your own this time, heroes.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00049=We didn't have time to devise a testing plan for this one. Improvise!
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00052=Round one: victory.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00053=A promising start, heroes.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00054=Your enemies will be on their toes now.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00055=Round one: defeat.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00056=You've lost the battle, but you can still win the war.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00057=Don't worry. This is only the beginning.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00058=Round two: victory.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00059=The second round is yours.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00060=Round two: defeat.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00061=A minor setback. Heh, nothing more.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00062=Round three: victory.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00063=An impressive win, heroes.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00064=Round three: defeat.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00065=It seems you've lost this one.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00066=Round four: victory.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00067=Excellent work, heroes! Now finish this.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00068=Round four: defeat.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00069=That's the last loss you can afford.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00070=This is it, heroes. The next victor wins it all.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00071=The final round is about to begin. Get ready.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00072=You've been equally matched until now. Time to put that to an end.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00073=You have the advantage. Capitalize on it.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00074=Your enemy is almost defeated. Show no mercy.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00075=It's now or never. Win here, or lose it all.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00077=This weapon greatly enhances its wielder's power, but it also makes them a target.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00078=Using this weapon will make you a force to be reckoned with. Your enemies will surely focus on you.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00079=The potential housed in this weapon is incredible. Use it, but don't lose it.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00080=The weapon is yours. Don't let it fall into enemy hands!
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00081=Show me what that weapon can do, heroes.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00082=Your power is now unmatched, as long as you keep hold of that weapon.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00083=They've claimed the weapon. You must defeat its wielder to take it from them.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00084=Your enemy has the weapon. Strike down who holds it, and it'll be yours.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00085=The weapon is in enemy hands. Focus your attacks on its wielder, but beware of their power.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00086=Well done! The weapon is now yours.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00087=You've taken the weapon from your enemy. Now use it against them.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00088=The weapon is now under your control. Wield it better than your enemies did.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00089=You've lost your hold on the weapon. Now the enemy will use it against you.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00090=It seems that weapon's power comes at a cost. Make your enemies pay for it.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00091=The weapon is now in your enemy's possession. Take it back from them.
Conversation/VolskayaArenaVO/Line00092=One of the weapons has gone missing? That can't be good...
VoiceOver/Arena/GameStart00=Control the temples and defeat your enemy.
VoiceOver/SnakeGod/AllySlain00=Was that your ally? A shame.
