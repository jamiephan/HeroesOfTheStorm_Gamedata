Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00011=The spirits tell me that our raiders are being held captive by the Alliance. We must liberate them.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00012=It seems the Alliance has foolishly taken some of our warriors hostage. Be ready to free them.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00013=More of our soldiers have been taken prisoner. Let's take 'em back!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00014=Just spotted more of our captured forces. Get ready for a prison break!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00015=Another prison camp, eh? Well, it won't be left standing for long!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00016=More of our warriors have been captured. We cannot allow them to remain in enemy hands.

Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00021=The Horde's captured more of our troops. You know what to do!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00022=Our warriors need help. Free them so they can fight for us once more.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00023=These Alliance dogs seek to keep our warriors under lock and key? Do not let this go unanswered.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00024=Looks like we've both got prisoners to guard. Don't let ours get taken while we're capturing theirs!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00025=Alright, lads and lasses. Keep our prison camp from being captured and get our soldiers out of the Horde's!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00026=Now, warriors! Capture the Alliance's prison camp and guard our own!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00027=We must capture the enemy's prison camp, but they will try to capture ours as well.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00028=It seems we've both taken prisoners. Keep an eye on ours while you capture the Alliance's prison camp.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00029=Time for some action! Let's free our soldiers and take the fight to the Horde!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00030=I've got eyes on our forces! Move in and get 'em outta there!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00031=Those soldiers are counting on ya! Don't let 'em down!

Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00033=Free our soldiers, and show the Horde what the Stormpike Guard can do!

Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00037=I've found the orcs being held prisoner. I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00038=No Frostwolf should be held in chains. Get them out of those cages and onto the battlefield!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00039=Gonna take some time to open these cages. Guard them in the meantime!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00040=We need to guard the cage until the lock is open. Don't let the Horde near it!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00041=Alright lads and lasses, now we hold the line. Fight near the cage!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00042=It will take time to unlock the cage. Guard it well.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00043=The Alliance will attempt to keep the cage locked. Stop them from doing so.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00044=To free our warriors, we must keep the Alliance away from the cage.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00045=The Horde's attacking our camp! Secure the cage before it's too late!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00046=Our camp is under siege! We have to keep that cage locked!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00047=We've got Horde in our camp! Lock the cage!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00048=The Alliance is taking our camp! Push them out and reinforce the lock!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00049=Our camp is under assault. Stop the Alliance and secure the cage!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00050=Alliance dogs are attacking our camp! Lock the cage shut!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00051=Those Horde savages have retaken their camp. Push back and unlock the cage again!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00052=They've secured the cage. We have to unlock it again if we want this camp!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00053=Our rescue's been halted! Fight back and claim the prison camp!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00054=The Alliance has secured the cage. Seize the camp so we can open it!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00055=Our rescue attempt has been stopped, but not for long. Rally and take the camp!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00056=We've lost control of the camp. Wrest it back from those Alliance cowards!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00057=We took back our camp! Well done!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00058=Our camp is secure! Good work, lads and lasses!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00059=Hah! Did they really think we'd let 'em take our camp?
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00060=We've driven the Alliance from our camp. Well done!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00061=Lok-tar ogar! We've retaken our camp!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00062=Our camp is safe again. Now let's keep it that way.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00063=<angry exertion> The Horde's taken our camp! Get ready to stop their raiders!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00064=They've managed to free their raiders. Won't be long before they charge at us!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00065=Brace yourselves, the Horde's raiders will be here soon!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00066=The Alliance has taken control of our camp. Their cavalry will soon charge at us.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00067=Our camp has fallen. Be ready for the Alliance's cavalry!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00068=We've lost our camp to the Alliance. Prepare to slay their cavalry!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00079=We've done it! Get ready to fight with the cavalry!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00080=The Horde's camp is ours! When the cavalry charges, we go with them!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00081=Camp secured! Now let's take the fight to the Horde!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00082=We've taken the Alliance's camp! Join our raiders in battle!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00083=Our raiders are free, and eager to pay the Alliance back. Let's help them with that.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00084=The Alliance camp is ours! Lead our raiders to victory!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00085=Yes! Time to show them what the Stormpikes can do!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00086=As if the Horde could ever stop us. Mount up!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00087=We've rescued our soldiers, and they're itching for some payback!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00088=Hah! They messed with the wrong army!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00089=Another camp under control! Oh, this is going to be good.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00090=The Alliance never learn, do they? Teach them another lesson.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00091=No cage can hold a true Frostwolf. Raiders, to me!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00092=They're no match for our strength. Push forward!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00093=With the spirits on our side, we cannot lose!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00094=The Alliance wants a war? We'll give them a war.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00095=Charge!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00096=For the Alliance!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00097=For the Stormpikes!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00098=Let's do this!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00101=Alterac will be ours!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00109=It took that many Horde to stop our cavalry? Hah!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00110=Our cavalry's sacrifice will not be in vain! The Frostwolves are finished!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00111=Taking out our cavalry won't win you the war, Drek'Thar!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00112=Is that the best you can do, Frostwolves? It won't be enough!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00113=You can knock us down, but we'll get right back up!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00114=Our raiders fought with honor, and died with glory.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00115=This is the last blow you strike against the Horde, dwarf.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00116=The next time our raiders charge, the Stormpikes will fall!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00117=It will take more than that to stop the Frostwolf clan!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00118=See that, Vanndar? That's how real warriors fight.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00119=We've taken Iceblood Fort!

Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00154=The Alliance has lost Icewing Keep along with its warmaster!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00155=One keep down! That's one less warmaster for the Horde!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00156=Now that's a good start! Take out the rest of the keeps!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00157=Hah! Each keep we smash means one less warmaster!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00158=We've taken an Alliance keep and slain a warmaster!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00159=This is but the first Alliance keep to fall!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00160=Continue destroying their keeps and denying them warmasters!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00161=Another Horde keep in ruins! We're taking down their warmasters!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00162=We've brought down another keep! The Horde's losing warmasters fast!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00163=Two keeps down, one to go!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00164=That's the second destroyed Alliance keep. They're running out of warmasters.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00165=Another step closer to victory. Vanndar's warmasters are dropping like flies.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00166=Blood and thunder! The Alliance has only one keep left!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00167=That's the last Horde keep! Drek'Thar is on his own!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00168=We've destroyed all their keeps. Now for Drek'Thar!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00169=The Horde has no keeps left! Let's finish this!

Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00194=Stormpike filth, in my keep? Slay them all!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00195=You seek to draw the Frostwolf General from his fortress?
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00196=Stormpike weaklings! Face me in my fortress if you dare!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00197=Haha! The power of the Nexus belongs to the Stormpikes!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00198=The Horde and their Raven Lord never stood a chance!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00199=Together, the Alliance and King's Crest are unstoppable!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00200=I can hear the great raven spirit of the land rejoicing with us!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00201=The spirits of the Nexus grant us strength! For the Horde!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00202=Our mysterious patron is powerful indeed... even for the Nexus.

Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00215=The Horde's captured more of our troops. You know what to do!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00216=Looks like we're gonna have another prison camp to knock down.
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00217=Alright, lads and lasses. Keep our prison camp from being captured and get our soldiers out of the Horde's!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00218=Time for some action! Let's free our soldiers and take the fight to the Horde!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00219=I've got eyes on our forces! Move in and get 'em outta there!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00220=Free our soldiers, and show the Horde what the Stormpike Guard can do!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00221=Gonna take some time to open these cages. Guard them in the meantime!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00222=We need to guard the cage until the lock is open. Don't let the Horde near it!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00223=Alright lads and lasses, now we hold the line. Fight near the cage!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00224=The Horde's attacking our camp! Secure the cage before it's too late!

Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00230=Those Horde savages have retaken their camp. Push back and unlock the cage again!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00231=They've secured the cage. We have to unlock it again if we want this camp!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00232=Our rescue's been halted! Fight back and claim the prison camp!

Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00235=Hah! They messed with the wrong army!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00236=<angry exertion> The Horde's taken our camp! Get ready to stop their raiders!
Conversation/AlteracValleyVO/Line00237=They've managed to free their raiders. Won't be long before they charge at us!
