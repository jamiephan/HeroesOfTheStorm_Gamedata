Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00012=What? I mean--I knew I could do that! I've opened my tunnel as well!

Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00045=The altars have risen. Activate them now.

Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00047=Capture the altars, and we shall deal the Raven Lord a grievous blow.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00048=And so they return. Capture the altars quickly, heroes.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00049=The altars belong those who claim them. That means you.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00050=The tower is mine. As it should be.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00051=My hold on this realm tightens.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00052=Impressive, heroes.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00053=Good. Another tower is mine!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00054=The tower is under my control.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00055=Well done. Another tower obeys me.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00056=Ugh, the Grave Keeper has taken a tower.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00058=One of my towers has been stolen.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00060=Do not let them take our towers!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00061=Be careful, we've lost a tower!

Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00063=The enemy is bombarding us. Claim a tower to end this siege.

Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00066=All of the towers belong to us. The Raven Lord will fall before my attack!

Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00069=<Laughs> Doom to the Grave Keeper!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00070=Enough of this charade. Bring down the Grave Keeper's core!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00071=Fire the towers! Destroy the Raven Lord!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00072=Yes, heroes! Activate the towers!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00073=Let the assault begin!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00074=You are no longer welcome here, Raven Lord!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00075=This realm turns against you!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00077=Oppose the Raven Lord and suffer!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00078=This realm is mine, Grave Keeper!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00079=Be gone from my domain!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00082=Heroes, I have opened a tunnel near our core that leads to the battleground's center. Use it well.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00083=Heroes, I have opened a tunnel near our core that leads to the battleground's center. Use it well...
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00084=Your tower has fallen to my heroes, Raven Lord.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00085=Another tower slips through your talons, Raven Lord.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00086=And that's one more tower for me.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00087=Do you like my newest tower, Grave Keeper? It was yours, once...
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00088=Your heroes are ill-suited to hold these towers, Grave Keeper.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00089=Did you really think you could keep that tower from me?
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00090=I have lost a tower, true, but the Raven Lord will lose this realm.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00091=Your sycophants will suffer for this, Raven Lord.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00092=Another tower lost? My heroes must redouble their efforts.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00093=You presume to pilfer my towers, Grave Keeper?
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00094=A tower lost? I will remember this, Grave Keeper.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00095=You will regret taking that tower from me.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00104=The time has come. Raven Court will belong to the Grave Keeper.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00105=If we can't attack directly, we will turn your weapons against you.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00106=So I see. But the towers are nothing...
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00107=Ah, ah, ah! That's MY specialty. Heroes, to battle! This realm will be mine!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00108=We hold... oh! All six towers. Commence bombardment upon the Grave Keeper!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00109=<satisfied exertion> The towers are mine once more. Now to rid my realm of this accursed Grave Keeper!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00110=All six towers are mine. Lay siege to the Grave Keeper!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00112=The Raven Lord is bombarding our core! Take back a tower, now!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00113=The core is under assault by the Raven Lord. You must reclaim a tower, immediately!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00114=Unacceptable. The Raven Lord controls the towers. Claim a tower, end his siege!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00116=Let's see how you handle this. My fortifications grow stronger.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00117=As do mine, Grave Keeper. This realm's power seems new to you... Don't bother getting used to it.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00118=Ugh... Enough of this. My fortifications grow in power. Witness the strength of the Raven Lord.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00119=Oh, is that all? Well, two can play at that game...
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00120=What is a Realm Lord without a realm? Don't worry, you'll find out soon...
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00121=You should have paid more attention to the mines, Raven Lord. That was your first mistake.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00122=What's wrong Raven Lord? Running out of tribute? <laugh>
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00123=Tell your heroes I shall keep watch over their graves... forever.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00124=You cannot resist forever. I know your hold is weakening...
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00125=My my, this situation is turning quite "grave" for you isn't it?
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00126=Mm. Perhaps you should have brought those foul golems with you.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00127=It's time to teach you a lesson. Lesson one: never provoke me!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00128=I'm preparing a grave just for you... Oh, I do hope you keep it. <laugh>
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00129=The power of this realm is mine... you wouldn't even know what to do with it.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00130=You do excel at pettiness, don't you?
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00131=<chuckle> That was almost amusing.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00132=Raven Court has seen usurpers before... I have ended them all.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00133=You're but a child. Fear not, your tantrum will be over soon.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00134=Oh, do continue. I am so very interested in your thoughts.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00135=Mock all you like. Your realm has abandoned you, and it's power will be mine.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00136=I look forward to never hearing that smug tone again!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00137=Once you're gone, I'm slaying every last one of these infernal ravens.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00138=<groan> Do you ever shut up?
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00139=Ugh, whatever.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00140=Your failure will soon be complete, usurper.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00141=Is that all?
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00142=All that bluster, and for what?
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00143=Hmm. How utterly droll.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00144=You're losing your touch, Raven Lord.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00145=Ha! As feeble as your words.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00146=I will not give up so easily!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00147=You will pay for your arrogance.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00148=Heroes, show this "Grave Keeper" to his grave.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00150=Tower acquired.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00151=The tower now belongs to me.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00153=We have taken a tower.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00154=Yes, my grip upon this realm tightens!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00155=A tower has been lost.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00157=The Grave Keeper claims another tower.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00159=The enemy has taken a tower.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00160=Our tower has fallen.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00161=The Raven Lord will fall before me!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00162=Show the Raven Lord the extent of my power!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00163=The Raven Lord will not keep me from this realm!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00164=You've lost this one, Raven Lord! It will not be your last.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00165=Fire upon the core! Shatter it!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00166=You will fall, Raven Lord! This is the way of the Nexus!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00167=Now, you shall fall!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00168=Let's see if you learn your lesson... this time!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00169=All towers, fire!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00170=You have done well, heroes. Let the Grave Keeper know my power!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00171=I am lord of this realm, and it will not be stolen from me!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00172=Your powers will be mine, Grave Keeper. Like all the others.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00173=<chuckle> None approach without my blessing. Be gone, before I force you out.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00174=...without the altars to fire them.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00175=It is nearly time... <laugh>
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00176=Yes, yes... let the altars rise!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00177=Lay claim to the altars. Do not disappoint me.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00178=Go! Do not let the altars fall into the Raven Lord's talons!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00179=This realm is mine. MINE!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00180=I will not return to those wretched mines!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00181=Heroes, hurry hurry... I grow tired of the Raven Lord's squawking!
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00182=Your execution will be wondrous to behold.
Conversation/FieldofSlaughter/Line00183=Mhmm.
