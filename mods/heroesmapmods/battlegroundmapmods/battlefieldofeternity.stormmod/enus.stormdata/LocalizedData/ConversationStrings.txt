Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00001=Take heed, mortals. I will arrive soon, and the demon lord is close behind.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00002=I shall land in a moment, as will my foe.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00003=Prepare yourselves! I will reach your position shortly.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00004=We immortals shall return before long, heroes.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00005=Be wary! Our eternal battle will soon be upon you.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00006=I am on my way, mortals. Be ready.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00007=I shall purge your evil from this land, demon!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00008=I fight for the glory of the High Heavens!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00009=You and all your servants in Hell will cower before me!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00010=I will deliver this realm from your corruption, hellspawn!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00011=Repent before my wrath, demon!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00012=There is no escaping my justice!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00013=Your end is at hand.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00014=Burn in the light of the Heavens!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00015=I shall cull every last one of you!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00016=Face the light, hellspawn!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00017=My will is strong. My soul is fire.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00018=Evil is its own undoing!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00019=There is weakness in your heart, demon!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00026=I must take up a new position!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00027=Be warned, allies! I move to new ground!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00028=It is time for a change in strategy.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00029=Our battle cannot remain here.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00030=I must find another way.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00031=Enough! I seek better ground.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00032=The demon is vulnerable. Take him down!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00033=My foe weakens. Strike hard, mortals!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00034=The demon lord's strength is nearly gone!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00035=He is weak. We must banish him back to Hell!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00036=Fight on, mortals! The abomination is nearly dead!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00037=My strength is failing. You must aid me, mortals!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00038=I cannot hold forever. I require assistance!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00039=My light fades. It may yet extinguish, if you do not aid me!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00040=The battle is taking its toll. I need your help, mortals.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00041=His evil, it is too great. We must rally, mortals!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00042=Yes...
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00043=<dark, twisted laughter>
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00044=The minions of Hell have... pleased me.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00045=Hah. I knew it would be simple.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00046=It was almost too easy.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00047=To me, mortals! I march for Hell's gates!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00048=The wickedness of Hell dwindles before me!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00049=Let the Burning Hells atone for their sins!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00050=I will cleanse this land from your corruption, hellspawn!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00051=The Heavens shall triumph this day!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00052=There is no place where evil can hide from my gaze.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00053=Valiantly done, mortals. But that was not enough to kill a demon lord.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00054=Your courage honors me, warriors. But the demon always returns...
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00055=We cannot rest in the face of victory, mortals. He will attack again shortly.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00056=Our foe is only wounded, not killed. This reprieve shall be brief.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00057=A bold strike, mortals. The demon will need time to recover.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00058=Well done, heroes. But we must be cautious. The demon shall rise again.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00059=I will soon crush my enemy... And you will aid me.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00060=Come, mortals. I must teach this fool a lesson... again.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00061=On your guard, heroes. The unending war moves toward you!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00062=Have you been waiting long? I am nearly there.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00063=The angel will return soon. You must rip him apart!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00064=There is no escape for you but death, angel.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00065=There is no escape for you but death, angel. 
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00066=The Burning Hells shall reign over all! 
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00067=Tremble before your true master!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00068=Hell has always been the greater power, angel!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00069=None can withstand me! Certainly no angel...
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00070=You angels shall know the taste of fear...
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00071=<laughs> I shall enjoy this!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00072=Die, angel...
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00073=The High Heavens will burn in Hell's fire!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00074=Abandon hope, angel. Darkness takes all.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00075=Our long war ends here.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00076=Is this all you have?
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00077=You are tiring. I can sense your terror.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00084=I never remain anywhere for long...
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00085=I will find his weakness!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00086=As the shadows shift, so do I.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00087=My foe will not expect this.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00088=I tire of this stalling!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00089=I am restless.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00090=Do not just watch him suffer. Kill him!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00091=He is failing. This is where you twist the blade.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00092=The angel is in pain now. Let us increase it.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00093=Well, little mortals... Shall we put him out of his misery?
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00094=How I loathe a drawn out struggle. Kill the angel, already.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00095=Aid me now, or risk my displeasure, mortals!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00096=There is no time to waste. Destroy my enemies, now!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00097=My foe thinks he can win. Prove him wrong!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00098=These fools are strong. Fight them, mortals!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00099=This would be over if I had enough minions! Hurry!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00100=I march for heaven's gates!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00101=I shall crush all you hold dear, angels!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00102=The angel could not stop me. None of you can.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00103=All of Heaven's glory will end in the claws of Hell.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00105=Cries of agony will echo throughout the Heavens.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00106=Our triumph brings order to this realm!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00107=We stand victorious!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00108=Our glory radiates through this land!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00109=Victory through righteousness.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00110=The light of the Crystal Arch shines on!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00111=A fine blow... But the angel is not dead--yet. 
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00112=Hah, you have felled him for now. But he shall return.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00113=Is his "grand march" over so soon? Enjoy your reprieve, mortals.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00114=That was amusing to watch, but it will not be his end.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00115=You made him suffer, I will give you that.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00116=A deep wound... But it takes more than that to kill an angel.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00117=Are you ready, heroes? We approach your position! 
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00118=Our conflict shall rage on shortly!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00119=Hurry, mortals! I move for the gates of Heaven. 
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00120=I shall march for Hell's gates!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00121=I will bring down the gates of Hell!
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00122=The demon moves for the gates of Heaven.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00123=The demon approaches the gates of Heaven
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00124=The demon has fallen, but he will rise again in time.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00125=Thus ends my assault on Hell. I must rest for a time.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00126=The demon's attack has failed. Yet, we have not seen the end of him.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00128=Behold... the Battlefield of Eternity.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00129=Here, the warriors of the High Heavens meet the soldiers of the Burning Hells in unending combat.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00130=You mortals could turn the tide of our battle...
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00131=Lend me your aid, and I will vanquish this demon lord once and for all.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00132=This is the Battlefield of Eternity...
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00133=Here, we show the angels of the High Heavens how foolish they are for defying us, though they never learn.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00134=But you mortals could turn this endless battle in our favor.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00135=Fight for me, and together, we will slay that arrogant wretch and all his kin.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00136=I must rest, heroes, but I will return.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00137=A worthy battle. I will return again soon, heroes.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00138=My strength leaves me. It will take some time before I can recover.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00139=I can do no more, for now.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00140=Have no fear, I will return to face the Demon Lord. I swear this.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00144=My rage has not subsided. I will return, and the Heavens will fall.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00145=Enough. I must recover my strength.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00146=I will find no rest until the light of Heaven is extinguished.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00147=Make ready for my return, heroes. The angel will fall once more.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00148=An immortal never truly dies. I will return and Heaven will fall.
Conversation/BoE_Heaven/Line00149=The gates of Heaven shall lie in ruins beneath my feet.
