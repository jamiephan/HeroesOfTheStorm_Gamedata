Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00005=We've redesigned our Triglav Protectors for combat in the Nexus. Prepare to begin field testing.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00006=A Protector is almost ready. Access its terminal when I bring it online.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00007=I'm starting up an access terminal.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00008=An access terminal will be online in a moment.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00009=I'm getting another terminal ready for you.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00010=A new terminal will be ready shortly.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00011=Triglav terminal online. Take control of it to pilot the mech.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00012=Power routed to the terminal. Control it, and you can pilot the Protector.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00013=Terminal activated. Take control of it.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00014=It's time, heroes. Control the terminal and bring in the Protector.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00015=Access terminal online. Secure it to activate the Protector.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00017=Triglav Protector operational. Assign a pilot and a gunner so you can test its weaponry.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00018=Protector online. Give me a full demonstration.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00019=The Protector is armed. And with it, our future is assured.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00020=Preparations complete. Pilot the Protector to victory.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00021=Impress me, heroes. The Protector is waiting for you.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00023=The field test has started. Attack the enemy Protector and see how much damage its armor can take.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00024=Enemy Protector online. Prepare your defenses.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00025=It looks like you have a hostile Protector on your hands. Destroy it, if you can.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00026=You're about to see the Protector's power up close. Be ready for it.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00027=I must know how much damage the Protector can take. Do not hold back.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00029=The Protector cannot move without a pilot.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00030=Weapons are only half of the equation. The Protector needs a pilot as well.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00031=Without a pilot, the Protector is not going anywhere.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00033=You need a gunner to use the Protector's weapons.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00034=The Protector's weapons won't function without a gunner.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00035=Assign a gunner so you can unleash the Protector's firepower.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00037=The Protector has been destroyed. Our technicians will analyze its combat data.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00038=Protector terminated. I must say, our engineers have made good progress with them.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00039=Strange, I did not expect the Protector to be destroyed like that.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00040=The Protector has been defeated? Interesting.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00042=The Protector needs refueling and repairs. I'm calling it back.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00043=Enough. I'm recalling the Protector so our technicians can analyze its combat data.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00044=The Protector has reached its limit. My specialists will deactivate it for now.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00045=We must shut down the Protector for now. This technology needs more work.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00047=The Protector has overloaded. My team will begin repairs.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00048=You've pushed the Protector to its limit. Well done.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00049=Test concluded. Now, we'll make adjustments accordingly.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00050=So that is the extent of the Protector's power. Impressive.
Conversation/VolskayaIndustriesVO/Line00052=Red team has taken control of a Protector.
