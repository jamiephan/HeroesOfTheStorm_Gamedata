Conversation/HoldoutVO/Comment00004=The containment cell opens and the zerg rush out of it. Pan down to the other cell to show it doing the same. Much fewer zerg are coming out of this one.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Comment00005=Shot of an active beacon on the map. A hero moves in to control it.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Comment00008=The smaller zerg get handled by the towers. Pan up to the larger zerg wave to show it destroying a town.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Comment00017=Another hero on the same team controls the other beacon. We see the beam from the beacons to the cell. It starts to fill up with zerg.

Conversation/HoldoutVO/Group00011=OBSOLETE
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00001=You're here just in time! There's been a security breach, and the enemy intends to let the zerg loose!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00002=The facility's beacons are designed to attract the zerg. Controlling both of them will amass the creatures in one of the cells.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00003=Once a cell is full, both will open. And then the zerg will attack both bases. That leaves us only one chance at survival...
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00004=We must control the beacons so that most of the zerg attack the enemy instead of us. Let's hope this plan doesn't kill us all...
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00005=Oh, dear... the beacons are energizing. You have to control them!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00006=The beacons have activated! Control them! Please let this work...
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00007=The beacons are recharging! And the zerg are growing agitated!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00008=A power spike from the beacons? They'll be active soon!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00009=Looks like the beacons are reactivating.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00010=H-here we go again... the beacons are powering up.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00011=The beacons are energizing.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00012=The beacons are active once again! Control them before the enemy does!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00013=There! The beacons! Capture them!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00014=The beacons are now online! Please, keep them out of enemy hands!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00015=Attain control of those beacons! We don't want to face angry zerg!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00016=Make haste toward the beacons! They are up and running!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00017=Excellent! The enemy will have to deal with a much larger wave of zerg than we will.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00018=The zerg are headed toward both bases in equal force! Th-this is less than ideal. Exterminate them!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00019=Oh, so many zerg, headed right for us! Stop them! Stop them at once!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00020=It seems we have fewer zerg to deal with than our enemy. That's some small comfort, at least.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00021=A... um... smaller batch of zerg is headed our way. Please get rid of them quickly!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00022=The incoming zerg rush is technically smaller than the one headed for our enemy. B-but it's still an incoming zerg rush...
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00023=At least the zerg that are coming for us are not as numerous as the ones our enemies face. So maybe there's hope yet.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00024=The zerg are free again! You must fight them off!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00025=Equal waves of zerg are headed for both bases. You m-must fall back to defend ours!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00026=Zerg inbound on both bases! Wipe out the ones coming for us!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00027=The zerg waves are dividing themselves equally between both bases. D-do not let ours fall!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00028=No, no, no! Most of the zerg are headed this way! Do something!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00029=Th-this can't be happening! The zerg are bearing down on us! Oh... I'm too smart to die!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00030=Th-the zerg headed our way are much more numerous than the other batch! And I'm trapped in here! Save me!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00031=Emergency! Scores of zerg are inbound on our base! Exterminate them immediately!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00032=Need I remind you that the zerg are chewing apart our base? Do something about them!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00033=Whatever you're doing, it can wait! You must deal with the zerg!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00034=This is a disaster! I implore you to get rid of these zerg!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00035=Security can't hold off the zerg ad nauseam. They need your help!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00036=I know you're busy, but p-please prioritize handling the zerg!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00037=Oh my oh my oh my these zerg must be exterminated!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00038=Fall back! Protect me from the zerg!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00039=Alert. Zerg attack in progress.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00040=<Adjutant: "Zerg threat eliminated."> Oh thank goodness! We live another day!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00041=You have my gratitude! I'd likely be zerg food without you!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00042=I am seriously reconsidering if this is worth the grant money. Thank you for dispatching the zerg.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00043=<Adjutant: "Zerg eliminated."> "Field research is so exciting!", they said. I'll show them some "excitement!"
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00044=We are clear of the zerg. Who designed this ramshackle facility? Oh wait, I did.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00045=The zerg are eliminated. I went into the sciences to avoid this sort of thing!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00046=D-did you get them all? I don't mean any offense, I just want to be s-s-sure.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00047=I-is it safe out there now? Yes? Whew! Nice work.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00049=Oh dear... here come the zerg. Fewer than the enemy's, for whatever that's worth.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00050=Look at all those zerg! They're headed for both bases. Worry about ours!
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00051=I knew this was a reckless plan! Legions of zerg have caught our scent! <Yelps>
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00052=Zerg waves defeated. Resetting pens as per protocol.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00053=Alert. Your base is being attacked by the zerg. Eradication is advised.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00054=Alert. Zerg forces are attacking both bases in near equal quantities.
Conversation/HoldoutVO/Line00055=Zerg pens opened. A larger attack wave is heading towards your enemy.
